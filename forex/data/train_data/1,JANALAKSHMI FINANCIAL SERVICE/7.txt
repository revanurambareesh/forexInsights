', 
IFC\u2019s proposed investment will help Janalakshmi in its plan to become a comprehensive financial services provider for low income households, to diversify its sources of funding and to expand the outreach of access to microfinance to borrowers who have little or no access to formal sources of financing.',

', Expected Development Impact', 

', 1. Access to Microfinance: This Project will help in expanding the outreach of access to microfinance to borrowers who have little or no access to formal sources of financing to women borrowers, including in low income states of India which have amongst the highest  population densities and poverty rates in the country.', u"
2. Balanced growth of Microfinance: This Project will promote a more balanced growth of microfinance in India. Janalakshmi's operations are expanding in Western & Northern India where MFI penetration has historically been low. Additionally, the investment seeks to support an institution that has been a front-runner in adopting technology to enable financial inclusion.", 

', 

', u"IFC's Expected Role and Additionality", 

', 1. Global Best Practices: IFC, through its global experience with MFIs and other low income financing entities is uniquely positioned to help Janalakshmi in its plan of becoming a comprehensive financial services provider for low income households. ', u"
2. Demonstration Effect: IFC's investment would underline the faith in the sustainability of the microfinance business post the changed regulatory investment in addition to building investor confidence towards provision of financial services to low income households.", u"
3. Diversification of Funding: IFC's debt investment will help the Company diversify sources of funding by providing comfort to potential lenders and investors. IFC's debt would also be for a longer tenor which would enable Janalakshmi to manage its asset liability gaps more efficiently.",

', Environmental & Social Categorization Rationale', 

', The lending profile of the company is focused on retail microfinance products (92%) followed by working capital and long term capital loans to micro small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector (7%) engaged in manufacturing, trading and services sector such as auto ancillaries, metals forging, fabrication, motor winding, ready made garment stores, fast food restaurants, small nursing homes etc. The industry sector exposures on account of MSME financing overall comprises medium E&S risks. Largest loan size in this MSME segment has been under $ 50,000. Hence, the overall lending portfolio present potentially limited adverse environmental or social risks or impacts that will be few in number, generally site-specific, largely reversible, and readily addressed through mitigation measures. Hence, the E&S risk of the proposed investment is medium and the project is categorized as FI-2. The applicable Performance requirements will be i) the IFC- FI Exclusion List; and ii) The host country E&S laws and regulations.', 

', Main Environment & Social Risks and Impacts of the Project', 

', Main E&S risks of the company\u2019s lending operations primarily emerge from the Enterprise Finance Services (EFS) and Long Term Business Loan (LTBL) to MSMEs that operate in low to medium risk sectors of manufacturing, trading and services.

', 
At present, the company  is in process of implementing an adequate E&S risk management system. The company will put in place the E&S risk management system to ensure that its borrowers are in compliance with applicable E&S laws and regulations. The company will also appoint an officer in-charge for implementing the system and provide training to the relevant field staff on E&S risk management system/procedures.

', Project Description', 

', The proposed project envisages a senior debt investment in Janalakshmi Financial Services Private Limited (\u201cJanalakshmi\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) which is a leading urban MFI headquartered in Bangalore, Karnataka with a borrower base of more than 1 million women borrowers and a loan portfolio of approximately INR14,000 million (US$223 million equivalent).', 
Janalakshmi is amongst the largest MFIs in the country and is amongst the few MFIs that have significantly expanded their branch network and outreach post the MFI crisis (and subsequent regulatory changes) on the back of significant capital infusions.', 
', 
IFC\u2019s proposed investment will help Janalakshmi in its plan to become a comprehensive financial services provider for low income households, to diversify its sources of funding and to expand the outreach of access to microfinance to borrowers who have little or no access to formal sources of financing.',
