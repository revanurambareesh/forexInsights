declaring  that it had purchased DVD and VCD rights for 15 Telugu films

judgment.  It also applied for and was granted ex parte injunction by the trial 


Court on 23.6.2003, which was vacated on 22.8.2003. The appeal preferred

', 9.      In the written statement  filed by the appellant  through its Managing 


Partner Bh. Sudhakar Reddy, which was adopted by respondent No.3, it was 


pleaded that the rights of VCDs/DVDs had not been assigned by respondent 


No.3 to respondent No.2 and, as such, M. Srinivasa Rao could not acquire 


any   such   rights   from   respondent   No.2   and   assign   the   same   to   respondent 


No.1.  In a separate written statement, respondent No.2 claimed that in terms 


of   agreement   dated   15.12.1995   executed   with   respondent   No.3,   it   had 


acquired   the   rights   for   future   technical   development   in   the   field   of 


cinematography.     Respondent   No.2   pleaded   that   after   accepting   a   sum   of 


Rs.8   lakhs,   respondent   No.3   had   assigned   irrevocable   copyright   for 


broadcasting   the   said   films   through   satellite,   cassette,   disc,   cable,   wire, 


wireless or any other system including its transmission through cable system 


without restriction of geographical areas and for this purpose, the assignees 


were   authorised   to   make   copies   of   recording   of   films,   disc,   tape   or   such 


other   media   as   may   be   required.     Respondent   No.2   admitted   that   it   had 


entered   into   an   agreement   dated   30.7.2001   with   M.   Srinivas   Rao   for 


assignment   of   the   rights   acquired   by   it   under   agreements   dated   25.6.1990 


and 15.12.1995.

', 
',                                                                                                      9', 



', 10.     On the pleadings of the parties, the trial Court framed the following 


issues:
', 
', 
',         "1)      Whether this court has territorial jurisdiction to maintain 

                 the suit?
', 
', 
',         2)       Whether   the   suit   is   bad   for   non   joinder   of   necessary 

                 parties?
', 
', 
',         3)       Whether   the   agreement   dt.   25.6.1990   will   include 

                 VCD/DVD rights and whether the plaintiff is entitled to 

                 claim the broadcasting rights thereunder coupled with the 

                 agreement   dt.   15.2.2002   and   thereby   the   plaintiff   is 

                 entitled for the manufacture and sale of the VCDs/DVDs 

                 of the suit films?
', 
', 
',         4)       Whether   the   plaintiff   is   entitled   for   the   relief   of 

                 declaration and the injunction sought for?
', 
', 
',         5)       To what relief?"', 





', 11.     After considering the pleadings of the parties and evidence produced 


by   them,   the   trial   Court   held   that   the   suit   was   bad   for   non   joinder   of   M. 


Srinivasa Rao, who is said to have assigned rights to respondent No.1.  This 


is evinced from the following observations made by the learned trial Court:  


',         "The   plaintiff   is   claiming   his   right   through   M.   Srinivasa   Rao 

        from   whom   the   plaintiff   has   obtained   an   agreement   for 

        assignment of the rights over the suit schedule films.  When the 

        defendants   1   and   3   have   come   forward   with   a   specific 

        contention   that   the   M.   Srinivasa   Rao   have   no   right   at   all   to 

        assign   the   VCD   and   DVD   rights   the   plaintiff   ought   to   have 

        impleaded the said M. Srinivasa Rao as a party to the suit.  But 

        the plaintiff has not chosen to bring him on record and he has 


',                                                                                             10', 



       deposed in his cross examination that he has no grievance at all 

       against M. Srinivas Rao and therefore he thought that it is not 

       necessary to bring him on record.   It is important to note that 

       the plaintiff is claiming right through M. Srinivas Rao.  He has 

       purchased   the   rights   from   the   2nd  defendant   and   because   the 

       dispute   is   that   he   has   conveyed   the   rights   which   was   not 

       covered by the agreement under which he got the assignment in 

       his   favour   from   the   2nd  defendant   the   plaintiff   ought   to   have 

       impleaded M. Srinivasa Rao as one of the parties and in spite of 

       the objection taken by the other side the plaintiff has not chosen 

       to   bring   the   Srinivasa   Rao   on   record   but   only   satisfied   by 

       saying   that   he   has   no   grievance   against   Srinivas   Rao.     This 

       issue   to   be   held   as   against   the   plaintiff   holding   that   the 

       necessary   party   Srinivas   Rao   is   not   brought   on   record   and 

       therefrom the suit is bad for non joinder of necessary party and 

       Issue No.2 is held accordingly."  
', 
', 



', 12.    The   trial   Court   then   referred   to   agreements   dated   25.6.1990   and 


15.12.1995   executed   between   respondent   Nos.2   and   3,   agreement   dated 


30.7.2001   entered   into   between   respondent   No.2   and   M.   Srinivasa   Rao   as 


also agreement dated 14.8.2001 executed by M. Srinivasa Rao in favour of 


respondent No.1, referred to the provisions of the ', Copyright Act', , 1957, two 


judgments   of   the   Madras   High   Court   and   concluded   that   the   plaintiff   has 


failed to make out a case for grant of declaration and injunction.





', 13.    In   the   appeal   filed   by   respondent   No.1,   the   learned   Single   Judge 


framed the following questions:
', 
', 
',                                                                                                   11', 



',         "1.     Whether the assignment of copyrights made by the third 

        defendant in favour of first defendant is true and valid?


', u"        2.      Whether the assignment of copyrights made by the third 

        defendant   in   favour   of   second   defendant   confers   the   right   of 

        manufacturing and selling VCDs/DVDs and whether the rights 

        assigned and conferred under Exs.A.4 and A.5 are only meant 

        for   `broadcasting'   the   suit   films   and   if   so,   what   is   the   effect 

        thereof?
", 
', 
',         3.      Whether   the   non-joinder   of   the   person   by   name 

        Srinivasarao,  who was allegedly  the assignee from the second 

        defendant and assignor in favour of the plaintiff, would vitiate 

        the suit?                                 or


        Whether the plaintiff can be non-suited for non-joinder of one 

        Srinivasarao   who   was   allegedly   the   assignee   from   the   second 

        defendant and assignor of the plaintiff?"
', 
', 



', 14.     Although, the trial Court had not framed any issue which could give 


rise   to   question   No.1   and   in   the   appeal   filed   by   the   respondent   no   such 


prayer was made, the learned Single Judge invoked Order XLI Rule 24 of 


the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC) and justified the framing of first 


question by recording the following observations:


',         "The first point as formulated by this Court in this appeal was 

        not framed by the trial court as an issue in the suit.  But in my 

        considered view, the trial court ought to have framed this issue 

        also in the light of the specific averment made by the plaintiff 

        in the plaint that the acquisition of rights by the first defendant-

        M/s   Divya   Exports   from   the   3rd  defendant-M/s   Nagireddy 

        Charities,   represented   by   its   Trustee-Venugopal   Reddy   was 

        totally  false and  baseless  having regard to the fact  that Sri  B. 

        Nagireddy, the original Managing Trustee of the 3rd  defendant-


',                                                                                               12', 



       M/s   Nagireddy   Charities,   had   already   given   away   the 

       copyrights during the year 1995 itself in favour of the second 

       defendant.   Hence, having regard to the said specific averment 

       made  by the plaintiff  in the plaint and also in the light of the 

       specific ground taken by the plaintiff in this appeal with regard 

       to the application of ', Section 73',  of the Indian Trusts Act 1881 

       (for short "the ', Trusts Act', "),  I deem it absolutely  necessary to 

       formulate   the   first   point   for   consideration,   exercising   the 

       jurisdiction of this Court under Order 41, Rule 24 C.P.C.   For 

       this reason, this Court formulated the first point as stated supra.


       From the submissions made at the Bar by the learned Counsel 

       appearing   for   the   parties,   it   could   be   seen   that   the   whole 

       controversy   revolves   around   Exs.A.4   and   A.5   and   Ex.A.3   on 

       one side and Ex.A.3 on one side and Ex.B.1 on the other." ', 




',        The   learned   Single   Judge   then   referred   to   the   pleadings   and   oral   as 


well as documentary evidence produced by the parties, ', Sections 73',  and ', 74',  of 


the   Trusts   Act   and   held   that   Exhibit   B.1   executed   by   respondent   No.3   in 


favour  of the appellant  was not valid.   Paragraphs 52 to 55 and 58 of the 


impugned   judgment,   which   contain   the   reasons   recorded   by   the   learned 


Single Judge for arriving at the said conclusion, are extracted below:


',        "52.    What is more interesting to note is that no trust deed or 

       any   other   document   was   pressed   into   service   by   the   first 

       defendant  while getting  himself examined as D.W.1 to clarify 

       or explain that Mr. Venugopalreddy had acquired the status of a 

       trustee   of   M/s   Nagireddy   Charities   in   order   to   effectively 

       represent the trust and to execute Ex.B.1 document in favour of 

       the first defendant.  Interestingly, D.W.1 was the Special Power 

       of Attorney Holder also, representing M/s Nagireddy Charities.', 


',        53.     In   other   words,   totally   an   alien,   not   connected   with   the 

       affairs   of   M/s   Nagireddy   Charities,   but   a   beneficiary   under 


',                                                                                     13', 



Ex.B.1,   was   examined   as   D.W.1,   representing   both   defendant 

No.1   and   defendant   No.3.     No   document   relating   to 

appointment of Venugopalreddy as a trustee of M/s Nagireddy 

Charities,   authorizing   Venugopalreddy   to   represent   trust   has 

been brought on record and no person directly connected with, 

and having knowledge of the affairs of M/s Nagireddy Charities 

had been examined on behalf of the defendants.
', 
', 
', 54.    It is to be remembered that the suit was instituted in the 

year 2003 and during the pendency of the suit Mr. B. Nagireddy 

was   very   much   alive,   of   course,   totally   in   a   state   of 

indisposition.     In   such   circumstances,   I   am   of   the   considered 

view that the burden heavily lies on either the first defendant or 

the third defendant to establish the change in trusteeship of M/s 

Nagireddy Charities, in which case alone Ex.B.1 document can 

be   called   as   a   validly   and   legally   executed   document   by 

Venugopalreddy in the capacity of the trustee of M/s Nagireddy 

Charities   in   favour   of   the   first   defendant.     Unfortunately,   no 

other witness, except D.W.1, was examined in this behalf.


', u"55.    It   is   well-known   principle   that   a   person   who   has   no 

proper   authorization   to   represent   a   trust   cannot   enter   into 

agreements with third parties in order to bind the trust - even if 

such agreements are entered into, such agreements are not valid 

in the eye of law.  In the instant case, the first defendant and the 

third   defendant   -   M/s   Nagireddy   Charities,   represented   by   its 

Power   of   Attorney   Holder   have   utterly   failed   to   establish   the 

capacity   of   Venugopalreddy   as   trustee   to   execute   Ex.B.1 

agreement assigning the VCDs and DVDs copyrights in respect 

of the suit schedule films in favour of the first defendant during 

the   lifetime   of   Sri   Nagireddy,   the   Managing   Trustee   of   M/s 

Nagireddy   Charities.   This   is   a   strong   and   suspicious 

circumstance,   which   compels   this   Court,   to   hold   that   Ex.B.1 

was   not   executed   by   a   proper   and   authorized   person 

representing the third defendant-trust, conveying the copyrights 

of VCDs and DVDs in favour of the first defendant.   Further, 

when   Mr.   Venugopalreddy's   authority   as   trustee   to   execute 

Ex.B.1   is   in   serious   doubt,   first   defendant,   who   is   the 

beneficiary of the said document cannot be placed on a higher 

and comfortable position that Mr. Venugopalreddy.


",                                                                                          14', 





', 58.     From the perusal of the impugned judgment it could be 

seen the court below while discussing issues 3 and 4, without 

going to the aspect of validity or otherwise of the assignment of 

copyright   in   favour   of   first   defendant   by   third   defendant, 

incidentally recorded a finding basing on the Xerox copy of a 

document Ex.A-12, that the plaintiff is estopped from raising a 

plea   that   B.   Venugopal   Reddy   has   no   authority   to   represent 

third defendant trust.  But a perusal of Ex.A-12 discloses that it 

is   only   a   reiteration   of   assignment   of   broadcast   rights   under 

Ex.A-5.   In this context it is to be noted that Ex.A-12 is only a 

Xerox   copy   and   the   original   is   not   filed.   No   reasons   were 

recorded by the trial court with regard to the admissibility of the 

said   document.   Even   assuming   that   the   said   document   was 

really   executed   by   B.   Venugopal   Reddy   in   favour   of   second 

defendant,   as   already   noticed,   it   is   only   a   reiteration   or 

confirmation of Ex.A-5. Further there  is no cross-examination 

by  the  defendants   1  and  3  on  this  aspect  and  there  is   also  no 

reference   to   this   document   in   the   written   statements   filed   by 

them. Therefore, so long as the execution of Ex.A-4 was agreed 

to   have   been   in   subsistence   by   virtue   of   its   execution   by   B. 

Nagi   Reddy,   Managing   Trustee   of   third   defendant   assigning 

rights for a period of seventy years, Ex.A-12 does not gain any 

significance. If Ex.A-12 is to be accepted, notwithstanding the 

admissibility   or   otherwise   of  it,   at   best   it   has   to   be   presumed 

that B. Venugopal Reddy had become the Managing Trustee of 

third   defendant   as   on   the   date   of   execution   of   Ex.A-12   dated 

15-2-2002.   But   in   the   present   case,   the   whole   dispute   is   with 

regard to the authority of B. Venugopal Reddy to execute Ex.B-

1   document   in   the   capacity   of   trustee   of   third   defendant   in 

favour of first defendant, which is a prior transaction. In other 

words   the   genesis   of   the   rights   of   assignment   of   broadcast   is 

Exs.A-4 and A-5, but not Ex.A-12. Furthermore, the reasons for 

bringing   into   existence   of   the   controversial   Ex.A-12   is   not 

explained   in   the   evidence   of   either   of   the   parties   and   as   its 

execution  is  subsequent  to the  execution  of  Ex.B-1,  on which 

defendants   1   and   3   are   mustering   their   claim   of   copyright   of 

VCDs and DVDs, the same is not relevant and inconsequential. 

Hence, the finding of the trial court that the plaintiff is estopped 


',                                                                                                   15', 



        to   question   the   validity   or   otherwise   of   the   trusteeship   of   B. 

        Venugopal Reddy for third defendant is not justifiable."





', 15.     Although,   learned   senior   counsel   appearing   for   the   parties   made 


elaborate   arguments   on  the   merits   of  the   findings  recorded   by   the   learned 


Single   Judge   with   reference   to   questions   No.2   and   3   and   produced 


publications  titled  Copinger and Skone James  on Copyright  (15th  Edition), 


Goldstein   on   Copyright   (3rd  Edition)   Volume   1   and   the   judgments   of 


different High Courts, we do not consider it necessary to examine the same 


because   in   our   considered   view,   the   learned   Single   Judge   was   not   at   all 


justified in non-suiting the appellant by recording a finding that Exhibit B.1 


was invalid.
', 
', 



', 16.     Since   the   trial   Court   had   not   framed   specific   issue   touching   the 


validity   of   agreement   Exhibit   B.1,   the   parties   did   not   get   effective 


opportunity   to   lead   evidence   in   support   of   their   respective   cases.     In   the 


absence   of   any   issue,   the   trial   Court   did   not   even   advert   to   the   question 


whether or not agreement Exhibit B.1 was valid.  The evidence available on 


the   record   was   not   at   all   sufficient   for   deciding   that   question   and   yet   the 


learned Single Judge decided that question by drawing inferences from the 


statements made by the witnesses examined by the parties with reference to 


',                                                                                                16', 



the issues framed by the trial Court and returned a negative finding on the 


validity of Exhibit B.1.
', 
', 



', 17.     In our view, in the peculiar facts of this case, the learned Single Judge 


was not at all justified  in invoking Order  XLI Rule  24 CPC.   If  at all the 


learned   Single   Judge   felt   that   the   trial   Court   should   have   framed   specific 


issue   on   the   validity   of   agreement   Exhibit   B.1,   then   he   should   have 


remanded the matter to the trial Court with a direction to frame such an issue 


and decide the suit afresh.   The omission on the part of the learned Single 


Judge to adopt that course has resulted in manifest injustice to the appellant. 





', 18.     In   the   result,   the   appeal   is   allowed.     The   impugned   judgment   is   set 


aside and the case is remitted to the trial Court with the direction that it shall, 


after considering the pleadings of the parties, frame an additional issue on 


the validity of agreement Exhibit B.1 executed between respondent No.1 and 


respondent   No.3,   give   opportunity   to   the   parties   to   produce   evidence   and 


decide the suit afresh without being influenced by any  of the observations 


made by the High Court and this Court.

', 19.     Since the matter is sufficiently old, we direct the trial Court to dispose 


of the matter as early as possible but latest within nine months from the date 


of receipt/production of copy of this judgment.   The parties are directed to 


appear before the trial Court on 10.10.2011.

', 9.      In the written statement  filed by the appellant  through its Managing 


Partner Bh. Sudhakar Reddy, which was adopted by respondent No.3, it was 


pleaded that the rights of VCDs/DVDs had not been assigned by respondent 


No.3 to respondent No.2 and, as such, M. Srinivasa Rao could not acquire 


any   such   rights   from   respondent   No.2   and   assign   the   same   to   respondent 


No.1.  In a separate written statement, respondent No.2 claimed that in terms 


of   agreement   dated   15.12.1995   executed   with   respondent   No.3,   it   had 


acquired   the   rights   for   future   technical   development   in   the   field   of 


cinematography.     Respondent   No.2   pleaded   that   after   accepting   a   sum   of 


Rs.8   lakhs,   respondent   No.3   had   assigned   irrevocable   copyright   for 


broadcasting   the   said   films   through   satellite,   cassette,   disc,   cable,   wire, 


wireless or any other system including its transmission through cable system 


without restriction of geographical areas and for this purpose, the assignees 


were   authorised   to   make   copies   of   recording   of   films,   disc,   tape   or   such 


other   media   as   may   be   required.     Respondent   No.2   admitted   that   it   had 


entered   into   an   agreement   dated   30.7.2001   with   M.   Srinivas   Rao   for 


assignment   of   the   rights   acquired   by   it   under   agreements   dated   25.6.1990 


and 15.12.1995.

', 10.     On the pleadings of the parties, the trial Court framed the following 


issues:
', 
', 
',         "1)      Whether this court has territorial jurisdiction to maintain 

                 the suit?
', 
', 
',         2)       Whether   the   suit   is   bad   for   non   joinder   of   necessary 

                 parties?
', 
', 
',         3)       Whether   the   agreement   dt.   25.6.1990   will   include 

                 VCD/DVD rights and whether the plaintiff is entitled to 

                 claim the broadcasting rights thereunder coupled with the 

                 agreement   dt.   15.2.2002   and   thereby   the   plaintiff   is 

                 entitled for the manufacture and sale of the VCDs/DVDs 

                 of the suit films?
', 
', 
',         4)       Whether   the   plaintiff   is   entitled   for   the   relief   of 

                 declaration and the injunction sought for?
', 
', 
',         5)       To what relief?"', 





', 11.     After considering the pleadings of the parties and evidence produced 


by   them,   the   trial   Court   held   that   the   suit   was   bad   for   non   joinder   of   M. 


Srinivasa Rao, who is said to have assigned rights to respondent No.1.  This 


is evinced from the following observations made by the learned trial Court:  


',         "The   plaintiff   is   claiming   his   right   through   M.   Srinivasa   Rao 

        from   whom   the   plaintiff   has   obtained   an   agreement   for 

        assignment of the rights over the suit schedule films.  When the 

        defendants   1   and   3   have   come   forward   with   a   specific 

        contention   that   the   M.   Srinivasa   Rao   have   no   right   at   all   to 

        assign   the   VCD   and   DVD   rights   the   plaintiff   ought   to   have 

        impleaded the said M. Srinivasa Rao as a party to the suit.  But 

        the plaintiff has not chosen to bring him on record and he has 


',                                                                                             10', 



       deposed in his cross examination that he has no grievance at all 

       against M. Srinivas Rao and therefore he thought that it is not 

       necessary to bring him on record.   It is important to note that 

       the plaintiff is claiming right through M. Srinivas Rao.  He has 

       purchased   the   rights   from   the   2nd  defendant   and   because   the 

       dispute   is   that   he   has   conveyed   the   rights   which   was   not 

       covered by the agreement under which he got the assignment in 

       his   favour   from   the   2nd  defendant   the   plaintiff   ought   to   have 

       impleaded M. Srinivasa Rao as one of the parties and in spite of 

       the objection taken by the other side the plaintiff has not chosen 

       to   bring   the   Srinivasa   Rao   on   record   but   only   satisfied   by 

       saying   that   he   has   no   grievance   against   Srinivas   Rao.     This 

       issue   to   be   held   as   against   the   plaintiff   holding   that   the 

       necessary   party   Srinivas   Rao   is   not   brought   on   record   and 

       therefrom the suit is bad for non joinder of necessary party and 

       Issue No.2 is held accordingly."  
', 
', 



', 12.    The   trial   Court   then   referred   to   agreements   dated   25.6.1990   and

also agreement dated 14.8.2001 executed by M. Srinivasa Rao in favour of 


respondent No.1, referred to the provisions of the ', Copyright Act', , 1957, two 


judgments   of   the   Madras   High   Court   and   concluded   that   the   plaintiff   has 


failed to make out a case for grant of declaration and injunction.

framed the following questions:

',         "1.     Whether the assignment of copyrights made by the third 

        defendant in favour of first defendant is true and valid?


', u"        2.      Whether the assignment of copyrights made by the third 

        defendant   in   favour   of   second   defendant   confers   the   right   of 

        manufacturing and selling VCDs/DVDs and whether the rights 

        assigned and conferred under Exs.A.4 and A.5 are only meant 

        for   `broadcasting'   the   suit   films   and   if   so,   what   is   the   effect 

        thereof?
", 
', 
',         3.      Whether   the   non-joinder   of   the   person   by   name 

        Srinivasarao,  who was allegedly  the assignee from the second 

        defendant and assignor in favour of the plaintiff, would vitiate 

        the suit?                                 or


        Whether the plaintiff can be non-suited for non-joinder of one 

        Srinivasarao   who   was   allegedly   the   assignee   from   the   second 

        defendant and assignor of the plaintiff?"
', 
', 



', 14.     Although, the trial Court had not framed any issue which could give 


rise   to   question   No.1   and   in   the   appeal   filed   by   the   respondent   no   such 


prayer was made, the learned Single Judge invoked Order XLI Rule 24 of 


the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC) and justified the framing of first 


question by recording the following observations:


',         "The first point as formulated by this Court in this appeal was 

        not framed by the trial court as an issue in the suit.  But in my 

        considered view, the trial court ought to have framed this issue 

        also in the light of the specific averment made by the plaintiff 

        in the plaint that the acquisition of rights by the first defendant-

        M/s   Divya   Exports   from   the   3rd  defendant-M/s   Nagireddy 

        Charities,   represented   by   its   Trustee-Venugopal   Reddy   was 

        totally  false and  baseless  having regard to the fact  that Sri  B. 

        Nagireddy, the original Managing Trustee of the 3rd  defendant-


',                                                                                               12', 



       M/s   Nagireddy   Charities,   had   already   given   away   the 

       copyrights during the year 1995 itself in favour of the second 

       defendant.   Hence, having regard to the said specific averment 

       made  by the plaintiff  in the plaint and also in the light of the 

       specific ground taken by the plaintiff in this appeal with regard 

       to the application of ', Section 73',  of the Indian Trusts Act 1881 

       (for short "the ', Trusts Act', "),  I deem it absolutely  necessary to 

       formulate   the   first   point   for   consideration,   exercising   the 

       jurisdiction of this Court under Order 41, Rule 24 C.P.C.   For 

       this reason, this Court formulated the first point as stated supra.


       From the submissions made at the Bar by the learned Counsel 

       appearing   for   the   parties,   it   could   be   seen   that   the   whole 

       controversy   revolves   around   Exs.A.4   and   A.5   and   Ex.A.3   on 

       one side and Ex.A.3 on one side and Ex.B.1 on the other." ', 




',        The   learned   Single   Judge   then   referred   to   the   pleadings   and   oral   as 


well as documentary evidence produced by the parties, ', Sections 73',  and ', 74',  of 


the   Trusts   Act   and   held   that   Exhibit   B.1   executed   by   respondent   No.3   in 


favour  of the appellant  was not valid.   Paragraphs 52 to 55 and 58 of the 


impugned   judgment,   which   contain   the   reasons   recorded   by   the   learned 


Single Judge for arriving at the said conclusion, are extracted below:


',        "52.    What is more interesting to note is that no trust deed or 

       any   other   document   was   pressed   into   service   by   the   first 

       defendant  while getting  himself examined as D.W.1 to clarify 

       or explain that Mr. Venugopalreddy had acquired the status of a 

       trustee   of   M/s   Nagireddy   Charities   in   order   to   effectively 

       represent the trust and to execute Ex.B.1 document in favour of 

       the first defendant.  Interestingly, D.W.1 was the Special Power 

       of Attorney Holder also, representing M/s Nagireddy Charities.', 


',        53.     In   other   words,   totally   an   alien,   not   connected   with   the 

       affairs   of   M/s   Nagireddy   Charities,   but   a   beneficiary   under 


',                                                                                     13', 



Ex.B.1,   was   examined   as   D.W.1,   representing   both   defendant 

No.1   and   defendant   No.3.     No   document   relating   to 

appointment of Venugopalreddy as a trustee of M/s Nagireddy 

Charities,   authorizing   Venugopalreddy   to   represent   trust   has 

been brought on record and no person directly connected with, 

and having knowledge of the affairs of M/s Nagireddy Charities 

had been examined on behalf of the defendants.
', 
', 
', 54.    It is to be remembered that the suit was instituted in the 

year 2003 and during the pendency of the suit Mr. B. Nagireddy 

was   very   much   alive,   of   course,   totally   in   a   state   of 

indisposition.     In   such   circumstances,   I   am   of   the   considered 

view that the burden heavily lies on either the first defendant or 

the third defendant to establish the change in trusteeship of M/s 

Nagireddy Charities, in which case alone Ex.B.1 document can 

be   called   as   a   validly   and   legally   executed   document   by 

Venugopalreddy in the capacity of the trustee of M/s Nagireddy 

Charities   in   favour   of   the   first   defendant.     Unfortunately,   no 

other witness, except D.W.1, was examined in this behalf.


', u"55.    It   is   well-known   principle   that   a   person   who   has   no 

proper   authorization   to   represent   a   trust   cannot   enter   into 

agreements with third parties in order to bind the trust - even if 

such agreements are entered into, such agreements are not valid 

in the eye of law.  In the instant case, the first defendant and the 

third   defendant   -   M/s   Nagireddy   Charities,   represented   by   its 

Power   of   Attorney   Holder   have   utterly   failed   to   establish   the 

capacity   of   Venugopalreddy   as   trustee   to   execute   Ex.B.1 

agreement assigning the VCDs and DVDs copyrights in respect 

of the suit schedule films in favour of the first defendant during 

the   lifetime   of   Sri   Nagireddy,   the   Managing   Trustee   of   M/s 

Nagireddy   Charities.   This   is   a   strong   and   suspicious 

circumstance,   which   compels   this   Court,   to   hold   that   Ex.B.1 

was   not   executed   by   a   proper   and   authorized   person 

representing the third defendant-trust, conveying the copyrights 

of VCDs and DVDs in favour of the first defendant.   Further, 

when   Mr.   Venugopalreddy's   authority   as   trustee   to   execute 

Ex.B.1   is   in   serious   doubt,   first   defendant,   who   is   the 

beneficiary of the said document cannot be placed on a higher 

and comfortable position that Mr. Venugopalreddy.


",                                                                                          14', 





', 58.     From the perusal of the impugned judgment it could be 

seen the court below while discussing issues 3 and 4, without 

going to the aspect of validity or otherwise of the assignment of 

copyright   in   favour   of   first   defendant   by   third   defendant, 

incidentally recorded a finding basing on the Xerox copy of a 

document Ex.A-12, that the plaintiff is estopped from raising a 

plea   that   B.   Venugopal   Reddy   has   no   authority   to   represent 

third defendant trust.  But a perusal of Ex.A-12 discloses that it 

is   only   a   reiteration   of   assignment   of   broadcast   rights   under 

Ex.A-5.   In this context it is to be noted that Ex.A-12 is only a 

Xerox   copy   and   the   original   is   not   filed.   No   reasons   were 

recorded by the trial court with regard to the admissibility of the 

said   document.   Even   assuming   that   the   said   document   was 

really   executed   by   B.   Venugopal   Reddy   in   favour   of   second 

defendant,   as   already   noticed,   it   is   only   a   reiteration   or 

confirmation of Ex.A-5. Further there  is no cross-examination 

by  the  defendants   1  and  3  on  this  aspect  and  there  is   also  no 

reference   to   this   document   in   the   written   statements   filed   by 

them. Therefore, so long as the execution of Ex.A-4 was agreed 

to   have   been   in   subsistence   by   virtue   of   its   execution   by   B. 

Nagi   Reddy,   Managing   Trustee   of   third   defendant   assigning 

rights for a period of seventy years, Ex.A-12 does not gain any 

significance. If Ex.A-12 is to be accepted, notwithstanding the 

admissibility   or   otherwise   of  it,   at   best   it   has   to   be   presumed 

that B. Venugopal Reddy had become the Managing Trustee of 

third   defendant   as   on   the   date   of   execution   of   Ex.A-12   dated 

15-2-2002.   But   in   the   present   case,   the   whole   dispute   is   with 

regard to the authority of B. Venugopal Reddy to execute Ex.B-

1   document   in   the   capacity   of   trustee   of   third   defendant   in 

favour of first defendant, which is a prior transaction. In other 

words   the   genesis   of   the   rights   of   assignment   of   broadcast   is 

Exs.A-4 and A-5, but not Ex.A-12. Furthermore, the reasons for 

bringing   into   existence   of   the   controversial   Ex.A-12   is   not 

explained   in   the   evidence   of   either   of   the   parties   and   as   its 

execution  is  subsequent  to the  execution  of  Ex.B-1,  on which 

defendants   1   and   3   are   mustering   their   claim   of   copyright   of 

VCDs and DVDs, the same is not relevant and inconsequential. 

Hence, the finding of the trial court that the plaintiff is estopped 


',                                                                                                   15', 



        to   question   the   validity   or   otherwise   of   the   trusteeship   of   B. 

        Venugopal Reddy for third defendant is not justifiable."





', 15.     Although,   learned   senior   counsel   appearing   for   the   parties   made 


elaborate   arguments   on  the   merits   of  the   findings  recorded   by   the   learned 


Single   Judge   with   reference   to   questions   No.2   and   3   and   produced 


publications  titled  Copinger and Skone James  on Copyright  (15th  Edition), 


Goldstein   on   Copyright   (3rd  Edition)   Volume   1   and   the   judgments   of 


different High Courts, we do not consider it necessary to examine the same 


because   in   our   considered   view,   the   learned   Single   Judge   was   not   at   all 


justified in non-suiting the appellant by recording a finding that Exhibit B.1 


was invalid.
', 
', 



', 16.     Since   the   trial   Court   had   not   framed   specific   issue   touching   the 


validity   of   agreement   Exhibit   B.1,   the   parties   did   not   get   effective 


opportunity   to   lead   evidence   in   support   of   their   respective   cases.     In   the 


absence   of   any   issue,   the   trial   Court   did   not   even   advert   to   the   question 


whether or not agreement Exhibit B.1 was valid.  The evidence available on 


the   record   was   not   at   all   sufficient   for   deciding   that   question   and   yet   the 


learned Single Judge decided that question by drawing inferences from the 


statements made by the witnesses examined by the parties with reference to 


',                                                                                                16', 



the issues framed by the trial Court and returned a negative finding on the 


validity of Exhibit B.1.
', 
', 



', 17.     In our view, in the peculiar facts of this case, the learned Single Judge 


was not at all justified  in invoking Order  XLI Rule  24 CPC.   If  at all the 


learned   Single   Judge   felt   that   the   trial   Court   should   have   framed   specific 


issue   on   the   validity   of   agreement   Exhibit   B.1,   then   he   should   have 


remanded the matter to the trial Court with a direction to frame such an issue 


and decide the suit afresh.   The omission on the part of the learned Single 


Judge to adopt that course has resulted in manifest injustice to the appellant. 





', 18.     In   the   result,   the   appeal   is   allowed.     The   impugned   judgment   is   set 


aside and the case is remitted to the trial Court with the direction that it shall, 


after considering the pleadings of the parties, frame an additional issue on 


the validity of agreement Exhibit B.1 executed between respondent No.1 and 


respondent   No.3,   give   opportunity   to   the   parties   to   produce   evidence   and 


decide the suit afresh without being influenced by any  of the observations 


made by the High Court and this Court.

of the matter as early as possible but latest within nine months from the date 


of receipt/production of copy of this judgment.   The parties are directed to 


appear before the trial Court on 10.10.2011.
