    	', The Berkeley Campus is located in the historic Hillside school in the heart of Berkeley, nestled in the leafy hills. We acquired the national landmark site in 2012 after 86 years of ownership by the Berkeley public school system. This campus currently offers preschool through 9th grade. Our class sizes are small, which allows us to create a very personal atmosphere and has built a strong community of children across grade levels, parents and teachers. A variety of annual events, such as our Lantern Parade, Carnival and holiday celebration contribute to the strong community bond.', Our unique location enables us to use both the natural setting and its urban environment as an extended classroom. We regularly visit nearby parks and go on field trips to places such as the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, UC Berkeley, the San Francisco Aquarium, SFMOMA and many more.', History of the Berkeley Campus', We first opened our doors in Kensington in 2007, after a parent-led task force identified a number of families interested in German-English bilingual education in the East Bay. The parents teamed up with the existing German International School in Silicon Valley and jointly embarked on opening a Berkeley campus as an extension of the existing K-12 school in Mountain View. In 2012, we moved our East Bay campus to its permanent home, the landmark Hillside school.',

    	', The Berkeley Campus is located in the historic Hillside school in the heart of Berkeley, nestled in the leafy hills. We acquired the national landmark site in 2012 after 86 years of ownership by the Berkeley public school system. This campus currently offers preschool through 9th grade. Our class sizes are small, which allows us to create a very personal atmosphere and has built a strong community of children across grade levels, parents and teachers. A variety of annual events, such as our Lantern Parade, Carnival and holiday celebration contribute to the strong community bond.', Our unique location enables us to use both the natural setting and its urban environment as an extended classroom. We regularly visit nearby parks and go on field trips to places such as the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, UC Berkeley, the San Francisco Aquarium, SFMOMA and many more.', History of the Berkeley Campus', We first opened our doors in Kensington in 2007, after a parent-led task force identified a number of families interested in German-English bilingual education in the East Bay. The parents teamed up with the existing German International School in Silicon Valley and jointly embarked on opening a Berkeley campus as an extension of the existing K-12 school in Mountain View. In 2012, we moved our East Bay campus to its permanent home, the landmark Hillside school.',
