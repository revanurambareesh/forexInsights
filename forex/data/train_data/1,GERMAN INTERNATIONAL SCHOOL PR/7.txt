							', u"There are compelling reasons why you might choose to send your children to one of Germany's many fine international schools.", 
			
							', u"Many English-speaking expatriates are educating their children at Germany's international schools, and an education at such a school has numerous advantages.", 
			
							', There is, of course, instruction in the native language. And, since the student body is usually quite international, they expose the young people to a variety of cultures. They also do a better job than most German schools of introducing the students to computers, and the program of sports and extracurricular activities is more like what they are accustomed to at home.', 
			
							', Physical plants and facilities are usually quite modern, clean and comfortable, with new equipment more conducive to learning. And the curricula among international schools is uniform, allowing ease of transfer. They usually are accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC) and the European Council of International Schools (ECIS) and normally offer the International Baccalaureate. They may also offer the American high school diploma, British A Levels and, sometimes, the GermanAbitur.', 
			
							', The costs vary from school to school and in some cases may approximate what a US college education commands: as much as \u20ac16,000 per high school student per year. Preschool and elementary school grades may cost 30 to 50 percent less. Additional costs could include transportation, lunches, class trips and various special activities.',

							', At accadis ISB, you will find a learning environment allowing children to reach their full social, emotional and academic potential. Located in a newly constructed school building just north of Frankfurt, ', accadis International School Bad Homburg',  offers international education from Preschool to Secondary School. With a strong emphasis on promoting intercultural understanding, accadis ISB takes pride in being the only educational institution in Germany providing high quality programs from preschool to university.', 

							', accadis ISB is  just a short walk from ', accadis Hochschule', , where university students can choose from a variety of management programs. Internationality, scientific principles, practice-orientation and personal development have been the cornerstones of accadis\u2019 success in higher education for over 35 years.', 

							', Both institutions are non-profit organisations in private ownership of a Bad Homburg based family dedicated to high quality education.', 

							', Preparing young minds for a successful life in a globalized world has been the focus of accadis education since its very beginning. With 330 pupils from 38 different nations, it provides an almost intimate atmosphere and plans to slowly expand towards a maximum of 530 students.', 

							', The ', accadis Preschool',  provides a child-centered bilingual learning environment, where children are immersed in two languages, German and English, on a day-to-day basis. There are two teachers in every group - an English-speaking and a German-speaking one. All activities are conducted in both languages using the Immerson Method. Children are aged 2 to 5.', 

							', In ', accadis ISB Elementary School',  our 5 year old ', Primary Class', u" students already receive extensive early learning support in all areas of the child's
							development. This includes intensive training of pre-reading skills (sounds in words, syllables, rhyming etc.) in German. Written language acquisition in English has already begun at this level and is continued through Grade 1.", 

							', The ', accadis ISB Elementary School',  meets the curricular requirements of the State of Hesse and is a state-approved "Ersatzschule", yet the language of instruction is a balance between German and English. The overall effect is that of genuine bilingualism, offering transferability both to international and to German schools.', 

							', The ', accadis ISB Secondary School',  offers differentiated instruction, learning support for individual students or small groups and thorough preparation for the bilingual International Baccalaureate Diploma. The goal is to help each student reach his or her individual potential. Additionally, international students can find friends among local families and become immersed in the German culture while German students enjoy an internationally oriented school life.', 

							', Our educators are both local and international professionals as well as University professors teaching at accadis Hochschule.',

							', The Bavarian International School e.V. (BIS) was established in 1990 to offer a full-day education in English to children from the international community in the north of Munich. We opened in February 1991 with 6 students and in 2016 celebrate 25 years of inspiring and challenging young minds! In those years we have grown to a two-campus school with a steadily increasing enrolment of 1,070 students, representing approximately 52 nations. We are an IB World School, authorised by the International Baccalaureate Organisation to teach the Primary Years Programme (PYP), the Middle Years Programme (MYP), and the International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma Programme.', 
							
							', Our two beautiful campuses are located in Haimhausen and in Munich, Germany. The BIS Haimhausen Campus, 10 kilometres north of Munich, is situated within the picturesque grounds of Schloss Haimhausen and caters to students in EC1 (4-5 year olds) to Grade 12. Grade 12 graduates can qualify for an IB Diploma that will allow access to the best universities and colleges worldwide. In February 2000, German educational authorities recognised the IB Diploma for all German students wishing to enter German universities. In addition, BIS awards a US-style High School Diploma to its graduates. Students can also receive the MYP Certificate (end of Grade 10) which has been recognized in Germany as a "Mittlerer Schulabschluss".', 
							
							', The BIS City Campus, opened in January 2016, is a beautifully renovated facility on Leopoldstrasse 208 in Munich and caters to students in EC1 to Grade 5. Our BIS City Campus is a candidate school for the Primary Years Programme and is pursuing authorisation as an IB World School. These are schools that share a common philosophy - a commitment to high quality education that the Bavarian International School e.V. believes is important for our students.', 
							
							', Maximum class size in both our Haimhausen and City Campus Primary Schools has been set at 20 in EC1, and 24 in EC2 to Grade 5. Maximum class size for the MYP Grades 6-10 is also 24 students and the DP (Grades 11-12) is 18 students. The average class size school wide is 19 students.', 
							
							', BIS is approved by the government of Bavaria and fully accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC), and the Council of International Schools (CIS). BIS is also a member of the Education Collaborative for International Schools (ECIS), the Association of German International Schools (AGIS), the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Internationale Schulen in Bayern (AISB), and the National Association for College Admissions Counselling (NACAC). We subscribe to the NACAC¹s Statement of Principals of Good Practice.', 
							
							', u"One of the things that parents value most about BIS is its friendly family oriented school feeling and strong sense of community. Our teachers know just how to make new students feel accepted and at home, right from their first day. The Parent Teacher Organisation helps relocating families to find new friends, connections and resources, and to feel part of the school community. For many ex-pats, the school's families and programmes become a focal point of their life in Munich.",

							', Today, Munich International School is an independent, non-profit International Baccalaureate (IB) World School that has been authorised by the International Baccalaureate Organisation (IBO) since 1980. We continue to pioneer new curricula, including as a leading MYP e-assessment school for the IBO.  MIS is also officially recognised by the Bavarian ministry of education and fully accredited by the Council of International Schools (CIS) and the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC).', 
							
							', Easily accessible from Munich, the School takes full advantage of its 26-acre campus in an idyllic nature preserve near Starnberg to provide students with high-quality educational experiences both within well-equipped classrooms, laboratories and performing arts spaces as well as our exceptional outdoor facilities. MIS is a community school where 1200+ students from more than 60 countries learn together on a single, purpose-built campus.', 
							
							', Munich International School recruits the most caring, competent and committed teachers and staff from more than two dozen countries. These educators create a vibrant, diverse, student-centred programme of learning, supported by superior facilities and resources, such as our:',

							', The ', Obermenzinger Gymnasium',  is located in the lovely Munich residential district of ', Obermenzing', . With its small size and warm atmosphere, the ', Obermenzinger Gymnasium',  provides an environment in which both pupils and teachers feel comfortable and are able to build the foundation for a successful school experience.', 
							
							', Obermenzinger Gymnasium',  is an all-day school that offers a daily routine that alternates between classroom instruction, independent learning and creative activities (AGs).', 
							
							', In order to give our pupils the individual attention they deserve, the school strives to keep classes as small as possible. The average class size is currently 21 to 22 pupils.', 
							
							', Instruction is carried out within a "two-teacher system". In the lower grades an educational assistant (language assistant in the bilingual track) is in the classroom for most lessons. The educational assistant accompanies the pupils throughout the school day, including during the lunch break and study period. In the middle grades the educational/language assistant continues to support the pupils on a more limited basis - for example in core subjects and in their study period. The educational/language assistant is a student's constant companion and main contact person throughout his or her school day.', 
							
							', Starting with the 2013/2014 school year, ', Obermenzinger Gymnasium',  offers a bilingual track (German-English) for pupils who are already fluent English speakers. The role of educational assistant in the bilingual classes is filled by the English language assistant.', 
							
							', Another unique feature of the ', Obermenzinger Gymnasium',  is the ABIplus', ®', . Interested pupils have the option, while working towards their ', Abitur',  certificate (general qualification for university entrance), of also acquiring a vocational qualification as an Accounting Data Entry Clerk (VDP); Certified Business Assistant, Department of Information Processing; or a Multimedia Assistant (VBP). With some courses this qualification counts as a recognized professional certification.', 
							
							', In the 5th year students can choose between art, music and theatre.', 
							
							', Following a rotating schedule, every class can take one period per week for a class discussion on an as-needed basis. These class discussions can be initiated by either the pupils or the teacher.', 
							
							', Diverse cultural education, wind instrument classes/choir, a number of elective courses and extracurricular activities such as individual music lessons, diving, boxing, golf, photography and computer hardware courses serve to complement and round off the full educational spectrum. These enhance personal physical, social and intellectual stimulation, development and growth essential for success in academic and professional life.', 
							
							', The school psychology team, led by a qualified psychologist (', Diplompsychologe', ), is always on hand to attend to any mental health or emotional issues and to support pupils with educational therapy, if needed.', 
							
							', Recognizing the importance of a healthy diet, the ', Obermenzinger Gymnasium',  has its own canteen where two chefs prepare two different entrees for lunch for the pupils. Nutritional values are further augmented by a salad bar providing healthy choices and reflecting diverse dietary needs, cultural requirements and personal tastes.',

ISR is non-selective with respect to those who enter the IB program. Furthermore, all graduates have entered leading universities worldwide after graduation, such as Cambridge, Berkeley or TU München. As an accredited school, the ISR IB diploma is accepted as "Allgemeine Hochschulreife" in the German system, thus allowing students to attend German universities.', 

							', ISR offers an English language summer school program for four weeks this year, July 4th - 29th, 2016. Boarding facilities will also be offered, if you would like to give ISR a try. That way you can see if ISR could become your home away from home.',

The school's mission continues to reflect its Hahnian roots. Specifically, Salem aims to present young people with high academic and extra-curricular expectations and opportunities; and to imbue in them a lifelong sense of respect for the individual, responsibility to the community and an awareness of the importance of the democratic process in sustaining both.", 

							', The academic program in years 5-7 is delivered in German. Intensive instruction in German as a foreign language is available for international pupils. Even pupils arriving at the school with no German are fluent within one school year. For international pupils already fluent in English there is an accelerated English program leading to the attainment of the British GCSE qualification.', 

							', From year 8 onward, Salem is fully bilingual and offers a dual curriculum. Students may either study in the International Classes (years 8-10) in which the language of instruction is English or in the German branch leading to the German ', Abitur',  with German as the language of instruction. The International Classes follow the curriculum of the State of Baden-Württemberg but also include features of the IB similar to the International Pre-IB-programmes. Approximately one third of the students in the upper years are in the IB system. A significant proportion are from an international background.', 

							', At Salem, involvement in extra-curricular activities and the life of the boarding community are emphasized as much as academic achievement. All students in the upper years must engage in at least one afternoon a week of community service. All students must also participate in a regular program of sports and/or outdoor pursuits. Participation in theatre, music and visual arts extra-curricular programs, while not mandatory, is strongly encouraged.', 

							', u"Far more than in boarding schools from the Anglo-American tradition, responsibility for the everyday running of the School in the upper years is, in keeping with Salem's democratic ethos, placed in the hands of students under the guidance of staff. All activities and boarding wings are led by students elected by their peers under the guidance of staff. School regulations are framed with the consent of the student parliament and breaches of these are dealt with jointly by the school administration and the elected leaders of the student body.", 

							', Approximately one-third of pupils receive financial aid, the award of which is based on both need and merit. Our students are well prepared for tertiary studies, with almost all graduates eventually attending the most selective German and international universities.',

							', u"Many English-speaking expatriates are educating their children at Germany's international schools, and an education at such a school has numerous advantages.", 
			
							', There is, of course, instruction in the native language. And, since the student body is usually quite international, they expose the young people to a variety of cultures. They also do a better job than most German schools of introducing the students to computers, and the program of sports and extracurricular activities is more like what they are accustomed to at home.', 
			
							', Physical plants and facilities are usually quite modern, clean and comfortable, with new equipment more conducive to learning. And the curricula among international schools is uniform, allowing ease of transfer. They usually are accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC) and the European Council of International Schools (ECIS) and normally offer the International Baccalaureate. They may also offer the American high school diploma, British A Levels and, sometimes, the GermanAbitur.', 
			
							', The costs vary from school to school and in some cases may approximate what a US college education commands: as much as \u20ac16,000 per high school student per year. Preschool and elementary school grades may cost 30 to 50 percent less. Additional costs could include transportation, lunches, class trips and various special activities.',

							', At accadis ISB, you will find a learning environment allowing children to reach their full social, emotional and academic potential. Located in a newly constructed school building just north of Frankfurt, ', accadis International School Bad Homburg',  offers international education from Preschool to Secondary School. With a strong emphasis on promoting intercultural understanding, accadis ISB takes pride in being the only educational institution in Germany providing high quality programs from preschool to university.',

							', Both institutions are non-profit organisations in private ownership of a Bad Homburg based family dedicated to high quality education.', 

							', Preparing young minds for a successful life in a globalized world has been the focus of accadis education since its very beginning. With 330 pupils from 38 different nations, it provides an almost intimate atmosphere and plans to slowly expand towards a maximum of 530 students.', 

							', The ', accadis Preschool',  provides a child-centered bilingual learning environment, where children are immersed in two languages, German and English, on a day-to-day basis. There are two teachers in every group - an English-speaking and a German-speaking one. All activities are conducted in both languages using the Immerson Method. Children are aged 2 to 5.', 

							', In ', accadis ISB Elementary School',  our 5 year old ', Primary Class', u" students already receive extensive early learning support in all areas of the child's
							development. This includes intensive training of pre-reading skills (sounds in words, syllables, rhyming etc.) in German. Written language acquisition in English has already begun at this level and is continued through Grade 1.", 

							', The ', accadis ISB Elementary School',  meets the curricular requirements of the State of Hesse and is a state-approved "Ersatzschule", yet the language of instruction is a balance between German and English. The overall effect is that of genuine bilingualism, offering transferability both to international and to German schools.', 

							', The ', accadis ISB Secondary School',  offers differentiated instruction, learning support for individual students or small groups and thorough preparation for the bilingual International Baccalaureate Diploma. The goal is to help each student reach his or her individual potential. Additionally, international students can find friends among local families and become immersed in the German culture while German students enjoy an internationally oriented school life.',

We opened in February 1991 with 6 students and in 2016 celebrate 25 years of inspiring and challenging young minds! In those years we have grown to a two-campus school with a steadily increasing enrolment of 1,070 students, representing approximately 52 nations.

Grade 12 graduates can qualify for an IB Diploma that will allow access to the best universities and colleges worldwide. In February 2000, German educational authorities recognised the IB Diploma for all German students wishing to enter German universities. In addition, BIS awards a US-style High School Diploma to its graduates. Students can also receive the MYP Certificate (end of Grade 10) which has been recognized in Germany as a "Mittlerer Schulabschluss".', 
							
							', The BIS City Campus, opened in January 2016, is a beautifully renovated facility on Leopoldstrasse 208 in Munich and caters to students in EC1 to Grade 5.

							', BIS is approved by the government of Bavaria and fully accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC), and the Council of International Schools (CIS). BIS is also a member of the Education Collaborative for International Schools (ECIS), the Association of German International Schools (AGIS), the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Internationale Schulen in Bayern (AISB), and the National Association for College Admissions Counselling (NACAC). We subscribe to the NACAC¹s Statement of Principals of Good Practice.', 
							
							', u"One of the things that parents value most about BIS is its friendly family oriented school feeling and strong sense of community. Our teachers know just how to make new students feel accepted and at home, right from their first day. The Parent Teacher Organisation helps relocating families to find new friends, connections and resources, and to feel part of the school community. For many ex-pats, the school's families and programmes become a focal point of their life in Munich.",

							', The ', Obermenzinger Gymnasium',  is located in the lovely Munich residential district of ', Obermenzing', . With its small size and warm atmosphere, the ', Obermenzinger Gymnasium',  provides an environment in which both pupils and teachers feel comfortable and are able to build the foundation for a successful school experience.', 
							
							', Obermenzinger Gymnasium',  is an all-day school that offers a daily routine that alternates between classroom instruction, independent learning and creative activities (AGs).', 
							
							', In order to give our pupils the individual attention they deserve, the school strives to keep classes as small as possible. The average class size is currently 21 to 22 pupils.', 
							
							', Instruction is carried out within a "two-teacher system". In the lower grades an educational assistant (language assistant in the bilingual track) is in the classroom for most lessons. The educational assistant accompanies the pupils throughout the school day, including during the lunch break and study period. In the middle grades the educational/language assistant continues to support the pupils on a more limited basis - for example in core subjects and in their study period. The educational/language assistant is a student's constant companion and main contact person throughout his or her school day.', 
							
							', Starting with the 2013/2014 school year, ', Obermenzinger Gymnasium',  offers a bilingual track (German-English) for pupils who are already fluent English speakers. The role of educational assistant in the bilingual classes is filled by the English language assistant.', 
							
							', Another unique feature of the ', Obermenzinger Gymnasium',  is the ABIplus', ®', . Interested pupils have the option, while working towards their ', Abitur',  certificate (general qualification for university entrance), of also acquiring a vocational qualification as an Accounting Data Entry Clerk (VDP); Certified Business Assistant, Department of Information Processing; or a Multimedia Assistant (VBP). With some courses this qualification counts as a recognized professional certification.', 
							
							', In the 5th year students can choose between art, music and theatre.', 
							
							', Following a rotating schedule, every class can take one period per week for a class discussion on an as-needed basis. These class discussions can be initiated by either the pupils or the teacher.', 
							
							', Diverse cultural education, wind instrument classes/choir, a number of elective courses and extracurricular activities such as individual music lessons, diving, boxing, golf, photography and computer hardware courses serve to complement and round off the full educational spectrum. These enhance personal physical, social and intellectual stimulation, development and growth essential for success in academic and professional life.', 
							
							', The school psychology team, led by a qualified psychologist (', Diplompsychologe', ), is always on hand to attend to any mental health or emotional issues and to support pupils with educational therapy, if needed.', 
							
							', Recognizing the importance of a healthy diet, the ', Obermenzinger Gymnasium',  has its own canteen where two chefs prepare two different entrees for lunch for the pupils. Nutritional values are further augmented by a salad bar providing healthy choices and reflecting diverse dietary needs, cultural requirements and personal tastes.',

The school's mission continues to reflect its Hahnian roots. Specifically, Salem aims to present young people with high academic and extra-curricular expectations and opportunities; and to imbue in them a lifelong sense of respect for the individual, responsibility to the community and an awareness of the importance of the democratic process in sustaining both.", 

							', The academic program in years 5-7 is delivered in German. Intensive instruction in German as a foreign language is available for international pupils. Even pupils arriving at the school with no German are fluent within one school year. For international pupils already fluent in English there is an accelerated English program leading to the attainment of the British GCSE qualification.', 

							', From year 8 onward, Salem is fully bilingual and offers a dual curriculum. Students may either study in the International Classes (years 8-10) in which the language of instruction is English or in the German branch leading to the German ', Abitur',  with German as the language of instruction. The International Classes follow the curriculum of the State of Baden-Württemberg but also include features of the IB similar to the International Pre-IB-programmes. Approximately one third of the students in the upper years are in the IB system. A significant proportion are from an international background.', 

							', At Salem, involvement in extra-curricular activities and the life of the boarding community are emphasized as much as academic achievement. All students in the upper years must engage in at least one afternoon a week of community service. All students must also participate in a regular program of sports and/or outdoor pursuits. Participation in theatre, music and visual arts extra-curricular programs, while not mandatory, is strongly encouraged.', 

							', u"Far more than in boarding schools from the Anglo-American tradition, responsibility for the everyday running of the School in the upper years is, in keeping with Salem's democratic ethos, placed in the hands of students under the guidance of staff. All activities and boarding wings are led by students elected by their peers under the guidance of staff. School regulations are framed with the consent of the student parliament and breaches of these are dealt with jointly by the school administration and the elected leaders of the student body.", 

							', Approximately one-third of pupils receive financial aid, the award of which is based on both need and merit. Our students are well prepared for tertiary studies, with almost all graduates eventually attending the most selective German and international universities.',
