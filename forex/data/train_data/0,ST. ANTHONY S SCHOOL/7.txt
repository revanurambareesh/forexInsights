', St. Anthony of Padua Catholic School in Greenville, SC, offers a Franciscan education for children in grades K3-6. With an outlook on the human family, the world, and life that is remarkably unique, our school\u2019s legacy has been our pledge to prepare humble and courageous leaders to serve others and to change society.', 
', Distinctly Franciscan, proudly diverse, and centered in Jesus Christ, St. Anthony of Padua Catholic School educates and inspires students to be life-long learners and prepares them for lives of leadership and service as builders of the kingdom of God.', 
', Through hard work, dedication and generosity, St. Anthony\u2019s opened a new 26,000-square-foot, two-story school in 2013. Taught by devoted teachers, more than 160 students are challenged by a well-rounded, faith-filled education in an intimate learning environment.', 
', The growth of St. Anthony\u2019s can be attributed to the loving support and prayers of the parish, which has grown from 150 to 1,300 members over the past eight years, and the caring aid of the greater Greenville community.', 
', We are a Catholic school for all people. Our Christian values are eagerly shared, never imposed. Our students learn about God and about their dignity, and how that dignity is for the service of all sisters and brothers.', 
', Founded in 1951, St. Anthony of Padua Catholic School is one of the oldest private schools in Greenville County. Through solid educational instruction, discipline and growth in developing a positive self-image, we are \u201cWeaving a Bright Future.\u201d',
