', Gujaratis have a long tradition of seafaring and a history of overseas migration to foreign lands, to ', Yemen', [43]',  ', Oman', [44]',  ', Bahrain', ,', [45]',  Kuwait, ', Zanzibar', [46]',  and other countries in the ', Persian Gulf', [47]', u" since a mercantile culture resulted naturally from the state's proximity to the Arabian Sea.", [48]',  Today, Gujaratis can be found in all inhabited continents of the world. The countries with the largest Gujarati populations are Pakistan, United Kingdom, United States, Canada and many countries in Southern and East Africa. Globally, Gujaratis are estimated to comprise around 33% of the Indian diaspora worldwide and can be found in 129 of 190 countries listed as sovereign nations by the ', United Nations', .', [49]',  ', Non Resident Gujaratis',  (NRGs) maintain active links with the homeland in the form of business, ', remittance', , ', philanthropy', , and through their political contribution to state governed domestic affairs.', [50]', [51]', [52]',

', The second largest overseas diaspora of Gujaratis, after ', Pakistan', , is in the UK. At a population of around 615,000', [4]',  Gujaratis form almost half of the Indian community who live in the UK (1.2 million). Gujaratis first went to the UK in the 19th century with the establishment of the ', British Raj',  in India. Prominent members of this community such as ', Shyamji Krishna Varma',  played a vital role in exerting political pressure upon colonial powers during the struggle for ', Indian Independence', . Now this community is mostly the second and third generation descendants of "twice-over" immigrants from the former British colonies of ', East Africa', , ', Portugal', , and ', Indian Ocean Islands', . Most of them despite being ', British Subjects',  had restricted access to Britain after successive Immigration acts of ', 1962', , ', 1968',  and ', 1971', . Most were, however, eventually admitted on the basis of a Quota voucher system or, in case of Uganda, as refugees after the expulsion order by the ', Ugandan',  ruler, ', Idi Amin',  in ', August 1972', .', 
', Gujaratis in Britain are regarded as affluent middle-class peoples who have assimilated into the milieu of British society.', [53]', [54]', u" They are celebrated for revolutionizing the corner shop, and energising the British economy which changed Britain's antiquated retail laws forever.", [55]', [56]',  Demographically, Hindus form a majority along with a significant number of ', Jains',  and ', Muslims', ,', [57]',  and smaller numbers of ', Gujarati Christians', .', [58]',  They are predominantly settled in metropolitan areas like ', Greater London', , East Midlands, West Midlands, Lancashire and ', Yorkshire', .', [4]',  Cities with significant Gujarati populations include ', Leicester',  and London boroughs of ', Brent', , ', Barnet', , ', Harrow',  and ', Wembley', . There is also a small, but vibrant Gujarati-speaking ', Parsi',  community of ', Zoroastrians',  present in the country, dating back to the bygone era of ', Dadabhai Navroji', , ', Shapurji Saklatvala',  and ', Pherozeshah Mehta', .', [59]',  Both Hindus and Muslims have established caste or community associations, temples, and mosques to cater for the needs of their respective communities. A well known temple popular with Gujaratis is the BAPS ', Swaminarayan Temple',  in Neasdon, London. A popular mosque that caters for the Gujarati Muslim community in Leicester is the ', Masjid Umar', . Leicester has a Jain Temple that is also the headquarters of Jain Samaj Europe.', [60]',

', Gujarati Hindus in the UK have maintained many traditions from their homeland. The community remains religious with more than 100 temples catering for their religious needs. All major Hindu festivals such as ', Navratri', , Dassara, and ', Diwali',  are celebrated with a lot of enthusiasm even from the generations brought up in UK. Gujarati Hindus also maintain their caste affiliation to some extent with most major castes having their own community association in each population center with significant Gujarati population such as Leicester and London suburbs. ', Patidars',  form the largest community in the diaspora including Kutch Leva Patels,', [61]',  followed closely by ', Lohanas',  of ', Saurashtra',  origin.', [62]',  Gujarati ', Rajputs',  from various regional backgrounds are affiliated with several independent British organizations dependant on caste such as Shree Maher Samaj UK,', [63]',  and the Gujarati Arya Kshatriya Mahasabha-UK.', [64]', 
', Endogamy remains important to ', Gujarati Muslims',  in UK with the existence of matrimonial services specifically dedicated to their community.', [65]',  Gujarati Muslim society in the UK have kept the custom of ', Jamat Bandi', , literally meaning communal solidarity. This system is the traditional expression of communal solidarity. It is designed to regulate the affairs of the community and apply sanctions against infractions of the communal code. Gujarati Muslim communities, such as the ', Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b', , ', Khoja', , ', Dawoodi Bohra', , ', Sunni Bohra', , and ', Memon',  have ', caste',  associations, known as jamats that run mosques and community centers for their respective communities.', 
', Gujaratis have had a long involvement with the British. The original ', East India Company',  set up a ', factory',  in the port city of ', Surat',  in Gujarat in 1615. These were the beginnings of first real British involvement with India that eventually led to the formation of the ', British Raj', . India becoming the predominant ', IT',  powerhouse in the 1990s has led to waves of new immigration by Gujaratis, and other Indians with software skills to the UK.',

', The United States has the third-largest Gujarati population after the United Kingdom.

Significant immigration from India to the United States started after the landmark ', Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965', ,', [70]', [71]',  Early immigrants after 1965 were highly educated professionals. Since US immigration laws allow sponsoring immigration of parents, children and particularly siblings on the basis of family reunion, the numbers rapidly swelled in a phenomenon known as "', chain migration', ". Given the Gujarati propensity for business enterprise, a number of them opened shops and motels. Now in the 21st century over 40% of the ', hospitality industry',  in the United States is controlled by Gujaratis.', [72]', [73]', [74]',  Gujaratis, especially the Patidar samaj, also dominate as franchisees of fast food restaurant chains such as ', Subway',  and ', u"Dunkin' Donuts", .', [75]',  The descendants of the Gujarati immigrant generation have also made high levels of advancement into ', professional',  fields, including as ', physicians', , ', engineers',  and politicians.

', Canada, just like its ', southern neighbour', , is home to a large Gujarati community.

Gujarati Hindus are the second largest linguistic/religious group in Canada's Indian community after ", Punjabi Sikhs', , and Toronto is home to the largest Navratri ', raas garba',  festival in North America.', [88]',  The Ismaili ', Khoja',  form a significant part of the Canadian diaspora estimated to be about 80,000 in numbers overall.', [89]',  Most of them arrived in Canada in the 1970s as immigrants from ', Uganda',  and other countries of East Africa.', [90]', [91]',

', East Africa', [', edit', ]', 
', Former British colonies in ', East Africa',  had many residents of ', South Asian',  descent. The primary immigration was mainly from Gujarat and to a lesser extent from Punjab. They were brought there by the ', British Empire',  from ', India',  to do ', clerical',  work in Imperial service, or unskilled/semi-skilled manual labour such as construction or farm work. In the 1890s, 32,000 labourers from British India were brought to the then British East African colonies under indentured labour contracts to work on the construction of the ', Uganda Railway',  that started in the Kenyan port city of ', Mombasa',  and ended in ', Kisum,  on Kenyan side of ', Lake Victoria', . Most of the surviving Indians returned home, but 6,724 individuals decided to remain in the ', African Great Lakes', u" after the line's completion.", 
', Many Asians, particularly the Gujarati, in these regions were in the trading businesses. They included Gujaratis of all religions as well many of the castes and Quoms. Since the representation of Indians in these occupations was high, stereotyping of Indians in Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyka as shopkeepers was common. A number of people worked for the British run banks. They also worked in skilled labor occupations, as managers, teachers and administrators. Gujarati and other South Asians had significant influence on the economy, constituting 1% of the population while receiving a fifth of the national income. For example, in Uganda, the ', Mehta',  and ', Madhvani',  families controlled the bulk of the manufacturing businesses. Gated ethnic communities served elite healthcare and schooling services. Additionally, the tariff system in Uganda had historically been oriented toward the economic interests of South Asian traders.', [100]',  One of the oldest Jain overseas diaspora was of Gujarat. Their number was estimated at 45,000 at the independence of the East African countries in the early 1960s.', [101]',  Most members of this community belonged to Gujarati speaking Halari Visa Oshwal Jain community originally from the ', Jamnagar',  area of ', Saurashtra', .', [101]', [102]', 
', The countries of East Africa gained independence from Britain in the early 1960s. At that time most Gujarati and other Asians opted to remain as British Subjects. The African politicians at that time accused Asians of economic exploitation and introduced a policy of Africanization. The 1968 Committee on "Africanisation in Commerce and Industry" in Uganda made far-reaching Indophobic proposals. A system of work permits and trade licenses was introduced in 1969 to restrict the role of Indians in economic and professional activities. Indians were segregated and discriminated against in all walks of life.', [103]',  During the middle of the 1960s many Asians saw the writing on the wall and started moving either to UK or India. However, restrictive British immigration policies stopped a mass exodus of East African Asians until ', Idi Amin',  came to power in 1971. He exploited pre-existing Indophobia and spread propaganda against Indians involving stereotyping and scapegoating the Indian minority. Indians were stereotyped as "only traders" and "inbred" to their profession. Indians were labelled as "dukawallas" (an occupational term that degenerated into an anti-Indian slur during Amin's time), and stereotyped as "greedy, conniving", without any racial identity or loyalty but "always cheating, conspiring and plotting" to subvert Uganda. Amin used this propaganda to justify a campaign of "de-Indianization", eventually resulting in the expulsion and ethnic cleansing of Uganda's Indian minority.', [103]', 
', Kenya', [', edit', ]', 
', Gujarati and other Indians started moving to the Kenya colony at the end of the 19th century when the British colonial authorities started opening up the country with the laying down of the Railways. A small colony of merchants, however, had existed on the port cities such ', Mombasa',  on the Kenyan coast for hundreds of years prior to that.', [104]',  The immigrants who arrived with the British were the first ones to open up businesses in rural Kenya a century ago. These Dukawalas or shopkeepers were mainly Gujarati. Over the following decades the population, mainly Gujarati but also a sizable number of Punjabi, increased in size. The population started declining after the independence of Kenya in the 1960s. At that time the majority of Gujaratis opted for British citizenship and eventually moved there, especially to cities like ', Leicester',  or ', London',  suburbs. Famous Kenyans of Gujarati heritage who contributed greatly to the development of East Africa include ', Thakkar Bapa', , ', Manu Chandaria', ,', [105]',  ', Atul Shah', , ', Baloobhai Patel', ,', [106]',  ', Bhimji Depar Shah',  (Forbes),', [107]',  ', Naushad Merali',  (Forbes),', [108]',  and Indian philanthropist, ', Alibhai Mulla Jeevanjee', ,', [109]',  who played a large role in the development of modern-day Kenya during colonial rule.', [110]', [111]',

', There is a small community of people of Indian origin living in Uganda, but the community is far smaller than before 1972 when Ugandan ruler ', Idi Amin',  expelled most Asians, including Gujaratis.', [112]',  In the late 19th century, mostly ', Sikhs', , were brought on three-year contracts, with the aid of Imperial British contractor ', Alibhai Mulla Jeevanjee',  to build the ', Uganda Railway',  from ', Mombasa',  to Kisumu by 1901, and to ', Kampala',  by 1931. Some died, while others returned to India after the end of their contracts, but few chose to stay. They were joined by Gujarati traders called "passenger Indians",', [113]',  both Hindu and Muslim free migrants who came to serve the economic needs of the indentured labourers, and to capitalise on the economic opportunities.', 
', After the 1972 expulsion, most Indians and Gujaratis migrated to the United Kingdom. Due to the efforts of the ', Aga khan', , many ', Khoja',  Nizari Ismaili refugees from Uganda were offered asylum in Canada.', [114]',

', The Indian community in South Africa is more than a century old and is concentrated in and around the city of ', Durban', .', [116]',  The vast majority of immigrant pioneer Gujaratis who came in the latter half of the 19th century were ', passenger Indians',  who paid for their own travel fare and means of transport to arrive and settle South Africa, in pursuit of fresh trade and career opportunities and as such were treated as ', British Subjects', , unlike the fate of a class of Indian indentured laborours who were transported to work on the sugarcane plantations of ', Natal Colony',  in dire conditions. Passenger Indians, who initially operated in Durban, expanded inland, to the South African Republic (', Transvaal', ), establishing communities in settlements on the main road between ', Johannesburg',  and Durban. After wealthy ', Gujarati Muslim',  merchants began experiencing discrimination from repressive colonial legislation in ', Natal', ,', [117]',  they sought the help of one young lawyer, ', Mahatma Gandhi',  to represent the case of a ', Memon',  businessman.

', u"Most historians, even those who have sought to move away from the narratives furnished by the framework of colonial knowledge, are unable to begin their narrative of the Indian diaspora before the nineteenth century, but the Gujaratis had justly established a diasporic presence in the early part of the second millennium. So renowned had the Gujaratis become for their entrepreneurial spirit, commercial networks, and business acumen that a bill of credit issued by a Gujarati merchant would be honored as far as 5,000 miles away merely on the strength of the community's business reputation. They traversed the vast spaces of the Indian Ocean world with confidence, and a Gujarati pilot guided Vasco da Gama's ship to India... Under Portuguese rule the Indian Ocean trading system went into precipitous decline, and not until the nineteenth century did the Gujarati diaspora find a new lease of life. Gujarati traders migrated under the British dispensation in large numbers to Kenya, Tanganyika, South Africa, and Fiji, among other places, and Mohandas Gandhi, himself a Gujarati, has recorded that the early political proceedings of the Indian community in South Africa were conducted in the Gujarati language. In East Africa their presence was so prominent that banknotes in Kenya, before the country acquired independence, had inscriptions in Gujarati. Khojas, or Gujarati Ismailis, flourished and even occupied positions as teachers and educators in Muslim countries around the world.",  ',

', A historically mercantile culture, widespread influence of Jainism, diluted casteism and an intrinsic irreverence makes society and polity in Gujarat different from other Indian states. Centre-right in their economic leaning, people here naturally gravitate towards leaner governments with high standards of governance... Absence of local rulers\u2019 courts meant that trade-mercantile guilds ran affairs and administration. The kind of socio-cultural influence that pervaded the feudal kingdoms of Rajasthan etc was absent in Gujarat. The trade guilds were akin to the influential mercantile guilds of Belgium and the Netherlands, which contributed to making the Dutch world leaders in finance. In Gujarat, this cascaded into a strong entrepreneurial culture. As the English philosopher Bertrand Russell puts it, governments which consist of mercantilists tend to be more prudent in running the administration.',  ',

', Whereas one religion, Protestantism, has often been associated with the rise of Anglo-Saxon capitalism, Gujarati capitalism was much more a fusion of influences. Ethnic and religious diversity became a source of strength, multiplying the trading networks that each community could exploit. Pragmatism and flexibility over identity, and a willingness to accommodate, perhaps inherited from the mahajans, are strong Gujarati traits, argues Edward Simpson of the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London.

For example, Muslim merchants did not deal in printed textiles with motifs of living creatures on it, while these were procured by the Bania and Jain brokers. On the other hand Bania and Jain merchants would not deal in the trade of animals while Muslims did not have any problems with such trade. Similarly, Muslim merchants dominated the shipping trade and many were big ship-owners. The nakhudas and the lascars were also primarily from the Muslim community. On the other hand, some of the Banias and the Jains were prominent merchants and they organized an extensive trade from Gujarat to other parts of Asia. Thus, two forms of trade which formed the shipping and commerce were controlled by these two major communities of Gujarati merchants. For both these communities their relationship necessitated mutual understanding and interdependence in commercial matters so that they could play a complementary role in advancing their trading interests',  ',

In view of local hostility to intermingling, the merchants brought in wives, and a community emerged by 1860s. Its five to six thousand Hindus and Muslims fragmented, however, along ethnoreligious and occupational lines: Baluchi as soldiers of the Omani sultan, Memons from Sind in shipping and fishing, Parsi merchants, Hindu trading castes - Baniyas, Bhatias, Lohanas, and Shia Muslims, as well as Daudi Bohoras, Ismaili Khojas, Isthnasteris, and Goan Catholics. Ethnoreligious-professional traditions framed agency: Hindus usually returned when they had accumulated savings and wealth, whereas Muslims stayed and formed families... In the frame of dependencies between colonizer and colonies, the Gujarati enclave, protected by the Omani sultanate, did in the 1870s, become a conduit for British influence and, over time for British ascendancy. Distinct vertical links of each of the South Asian ethnoreligious groups to the British in Mumbai hindered horizontal Indian-cultured homogenization in the community. Mumbai's commercial expansion resulted in increased Gujarati in-migration, and Gujarati became the community's lingua franca. The privileged and thus distinct status granted by the Omani sultanate prevented indigenization.",  ',

', Early European travelers like ', Ludovico di Varthema',  (15th century) traveled to Gujarat and wrote on the people of Gujarat.

Prominent members of this community such as ', Shyamji Krishna Varma',  played a vital role in exerting political pressure upon colonial powers during the struggle for ', Indian Independence', .

', East Africa', [', edit', ]', 
', Former British colonies in ', East Africa',  had many residents of ', South Asian',  descent. The primary immigration was mainly from Gujarat and to a lesser extent from Punjab. They were brought there by the ', British Empire',  from ', India',  to do ', clerical',  work in Imperial service, or unskilled/semi-skilled manual labour such as construction or farm work. In the 1890s, 32,000 labourers from British India were brought to the then British East African colonies under indentured labour contracts to work on the construction of the ', Uganda Railway',  that started in the Kenyan port city of ', Mombasa',  and ended in ', Kisum,  on Kenyan side of ', Lake Victoria', . Most of the surviving Indians returned home, but 6,724 individuals decided to remain in the ', African Great Lakes', u" after the line's completion.", 
', Many Asians, particularly the Gujarati, in these regions were in the trading businesses. They included Gujaratis of all religions as well many of the castes and Quoms. Since the representation of Indians in these occupations was high, stereotyping of Indians in Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyka as shopkeepers was common. A number of people worked for the British run banks. They also worked in skilled labor occupations, as managers, teachers and administrators. Gujarati and other South Asians had significant influence on the economy, constituting 1% of the population while receiving a fifth of the national income. For example, in Uganda, the ', Mehta',  and ', Madhvani',  families controlled the bulk of the manufacturing businesses. Gated ethnic communities served elite healthcare and schooling services. Additionally, the tariff system in Uganda had historically been oriented toward the economic interests of South Asian traders.', [100]',  One of the oldest Jain overseas diaspora was of Gujarat. Their number was estimated at 45,000 at the independence of the East African countries in the early 1960s.', [101]',  Most members of this community belonged to Gujarati speaking Halari Visa Oshwal Jain community originally from the ', Jamnagar',  area of ', Saurashtra', .', [101]', [102]', 
', The countries of East Africa gained independence from Britain in the early 1960s. At that time most Gujarati and other Asians opted to remain as British Subjects. The African politicians at that time accused Asians of economic exploitation and introduced a policy of Africanization. The 1968 Committee on "Africanisation in Commerce and Industry" in Uganda made far-reaching Indophobic proposals. A system of work permits and trade licenses was introduced in 1969 to restrict the role of Indians in economic and professional activities. Indians were segregated and discriminated against in all walks of life.', [103]',  During the middle of the 1960s many Asians saw the writing on the wall and started moving either to UK or India. However, restrictive British immigration policies stopped a mass exodus of East African Asians until ', Idi Amin',  came to power in 1971. He exploited pre-existing Indophobia and spread propaganda against Indians involving stereotyping and scapegoating the Indian minority. Indians were stereotyped as "only traders" and "inbred" to their profession. Indians were labelled as "dukawallas" (an occupational term that degenerated into an anti-Indian slur during Amin's time), and stereotyped as "greedy, conniving", without any racial identity or loyalty but "always cheating, conspiring and plotting" to subvert Uganda. Amin used this propaganda to justify a campaign of "de-Indianization", eventually resulting in the expulsion and ethnic cleansing of Uganda's Indian minority.', [103]', 
', Kenya', [', edit', ]', 
', Gujarati and other Indians started moving to the Kenya colony at the end of the 19th century when the British colonial authorities started opening up the country with the laying down of the Railways. A small colony of merchants, however, had existed on the port cities such ', Mombasa',  on the Kenyan coast for hundreds of years prior to that.', [104]',  The immigrants who arrived with the British were the first ones to open up businesses in rural Kenya a century ago. These Dukawalas or shopkeepers were mainly Gujarati. Over the following decades the population, mainly Gujarati but also a sizable number of Punjabi, increased in size. The population started declining after the independence of Kenya in the 1960s. At that time the majority of Gujaratis opted for British citizenship and eventually moved there, especially to cities like ', Leicester',  or ', London',  suburbs. Famous Kenyans of Gujarati heritage who contributed greatly to the development of East Africa include ', Thakkar Bapa', , ', Manu Chandaria', ,', [105]',  ', Atul Shah', , ', Baloobhai Patel', ,', [106]',  ', Bhimji Depar Shah',  (Forbes),', [107]',  ', Naushad Merali',  (Forbes),', [108]',  and Indian philanthropist, ', Alibhai Mulla Jeevanjee', ,', [109]',  who played a large role in the development of modern-day Kenya during colonial rule.', [110]', [111]',

On the other hand Bania and Jain merchants would not deal in the trade of animals while Muslims did not have any problems with such trade. Similarly, Muslim merchants dominated the shipping trade and many were big ship-owners. The nakhudas and the lascars were also primarily from the Muslim community. On the other hand, some of the Banias and the Jains were prominent merchants and they organized an extensive trade from Gujarat to other parts of Asia. Thus, two forms of trade which formed the shipping and commerce were controlled by these two major communities of Gujarati merchants. For both these communities their relationship necessitated mutual understanding and interdependence in commercial matters so that they could play a complementary role in advancing their trading interests',  ',

In the frame of dependencies between colonizer and colonies, the Gujarati enclave, protected by the Omani sultanate, did in the 1870s, become a conduit for British influence and, over time for British ascendancy. Distinct vertical links of each of the South Asian ethnoreligious groups to the British in Mumbai hindered horizontal Indian-cultured homogenization in the community.
