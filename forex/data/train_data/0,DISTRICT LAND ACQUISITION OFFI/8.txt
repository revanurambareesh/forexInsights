', 
', History:',  The Federal Government inherited a substantial public
domain from its predecessor, the government under the Articles of
Confederation. By Article IV, Section 3, Clause 2 of the
Constitution, Congress was empowered "to dispose of and make all
needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other
Property belonging to the United States." In the act establishing
the Treasury Department (1 Stat. 65), September 2, 1789, the
Secretary of the Treasury was authorized "to execute such
services relative to the sale of the lands belonging to the
United States, as may be by law required of him," and the Office
of the Register of the Treasury was designated the agency for the
collection and dispersal of Treasury revenues. The Secretary of
War, in the act establishing the War Department (1 Stat. 50),
August 7, 1789, was made responsible for granting military bounty
lands (lands to which veterans of the Revolutionary War were
entitled by virtue of their military service). Treasury
responsibility for administering the public lands was defined
initially in the Land Act of 1796 (1 Stat. 464), May 18, 1796,
which provided for the orderly survey and sale of lands northwest
of the Ohio River. This responsibility was extended
geographically and amended procedurally by additional land laws
of 1800, 1803, and 1804. The act of 1796 required the Secretary
of State to record and issue patents (titles) to public land. The
General Land Office Act (2 Stat. 716), April 25, 1812, created
the General Land Office (GLO) in the Department of the Treasury
to "superintend, execute, and perform, all such acts and things,
touching or respecting the public lands of the United States,"
including those functions formerly vested in the Secretaries of
War and State. GLO transferred to the newly created Department of
the Interior under provisions of its establishing act (9 Stat.
395), March 3, 1849. GLO and Grazing Service (SEE 49.6)
consolidated to form BLM, 1946. SEE 49.1.

land laws, generated case files (commonly known as land entry
papers) containing land descriptions, financial records, and
records showing successive steps taken to secure the issuance of
land titles or patents. The papers originated in Divisions "B,"
"F," "G," "H," "K," and "R," and were maintained by Division "D"
(Mail and Files Division). The responsibility for posting land
and maintaining the central office set of tract books (volumes in
which the legal descriptions of land entries were recorded and
that serve as geographical indexes to the papers) was vested in
Division "C" (Public Lands Division) to April 12, 1907, and
subsequently in Division "O" (Posting and Tract Book Division).

', 
', 
', 
', History:',  A general land law of March 3, 1807 (2 Stat. 449),
directed that mineral (lead) lands on the public domain were to
be reserved from sale and leased to developers. At the request of
Secretary of the Treasury William H. Crawford, on behalf of the
GLO, which had found the demand for leasing insufficiently
productive of revenue, President James Monroe transferred the
function to the War Department, November 29, 1821, where it would
be managed for the benefit of the army's demand for rifle shot.
Secretary of War John C. Calhoun delegated the responsibility to
the Ordnance Department, where the Chief of Ordnance, Col. George
Bomford, responding to the failure of Congress to provide
appropriations to cover the employment of civilians as mineral
agents, initiated the practice, in 1822, of detailing army
officers to superintend the mines. These officers were variously,
and unofficially, styled as "U.S. Mineral Agents" and
"Superintendents, U.S. Lead Mines." Miners' resistance to War
Department oversight was such that President James Polk advised
Congress in his annual message, December 22, 1845, that leasing
was costing the government more to administer than it raised for
the treasury. By an act of July 11, 1846 (9 Stat. 37), therefore,
the leasing policy was abandoned. The lead lands were returned to
the administration of the GLO for disposal under provisions of
general land laws.

the Field Surveying Service (FSS) pursuant to the Civil
Appropriation Act for FY 1911 (36 Stat. 741), June 25, 1910,
which discontinued the practice of contracting for surveys. FSS,
headed after 1925 by the Supervisor of Surveys, who also headed
Division "E" (SEE 49.3.6), organized and headquartered initially
as follows: District 1, MT (Helena, MT); District 2, CO and WY
(Denver, CO); District 3, NE and SD (Neligh, NE); District 4, NM
(Santa Fe, NM); District 5, AZ and CA (Phoenix, AZ); District 6,
NV and UT (Salt Lake City, UT); District 7, ID and WA (Boise,
ID); District 8, OR (Portland, OR); District 9, AK (Juneau, AK);
and Eastern States (designated District 10, January 1918,
Washington, DC). By 1917, responsibility for WA had been
transferred to District 8, with new headquarters at Olympia, WA.
Effective July 1, 1925, concurrently with the abolishment of the
position of surveyor general (SEE 49.7) and the vesting of all
survey functions in FSS, its assistant supervisors of surveys
became district cadastral engineers in charge of cadastral
engineering districts. On June 1, 1930, District 3 was abolished,
and NE and SD were assigned to District 2. District 1 was closed
on May 1, 1937, and MT went to District 7. On January 1, 1941,
the districts were renumbered 1-8 to close gaps created by the
abolishing of old Districts 1 and 3. A reorganization of January
1, 1946, redesignated the districts as regions, in charge of
regional cadastral engineers, constituted and headquartered as
follows: Region 1, CO, MT, NE, SD, and WY (Denver, CO); Region 2,
AZ, southern CA (San Bernardino Meridian), and NM (Santa Fe, NM);
Region 3, ID, NV, and UT (Salt Lake City, UT); Region 4, northern
CA (Humboldt and Mount Diablo Meridians), OR, and WA (Portland,
OR); and Region 5, AK (Juneau, AK).
',

By March 1947 GLO's Division "E" (Surveying Division, SEE
49.3.6), headed since 1925 by the Supervisor of Surveys, had been
redesignated BLM's Branch of Engineering and Construction, with a
subordinate Division of Surveys in place by November 1947. By
July 1948 a Division of Engineering (redesignated Division of
Cadastral Engineering, January 1950) under the Chief Cadastral
Engineer had superseded the Branch of Engineering and
Construction, with a subordinate Branch of Surveying by January
1949 (redesignated Branch of Surveys by August 1950). In a
reorganization of BLM approved on January 26, 1954, the Division
of Cadastral Engineering became the Cadastral Engineering Staff
in the Division of Technical Programs. This organization remained
stable through May 1961, but by March 1962 the staff had been
reconstituted as the Division of Engineering. Pursuant to BLM
Order 701, July 23, 1964, the Chief Cadastral Engineer became the
Chief, Division of Engineering. By March 1968 the division
included a Branch of Cadastral Engineering. By Amendment 6 to BLM
Order 701, February 4, 1969, the Branch of Cadastral Engineering
became a separate Division of Cadastral Survey under a Chief of
Cadastral Survey.
', 
', u"
FSS itself had been in process of informal redesignation as the
Cadastral Engineering Service (CES) since at least August 1922,
and the term CES had virtually (if unofficially) superseded FSS
by 1940. Secretary's Order 2225, July 15, 1946, implementing the
consolidation of GLO and the Grazing Service to form BLM,
redesignated the Supervisor of Surveys as the Chief Cadastral
Engineer. Although the new bureau initially adopted the
organizational structure of its predecessors, including the CES,
it had by 1947 embarked on a decentralization program that
effectively broke up the CES and placed its regional components
under the immediate authority of BLM regional administrators,
with the Chief Cadastral Engineer in Washington, DC, providing
overall policy guidance.

1800-1980', 
', 
', 
', History:',  For most of the active period of public land settlement,
district land offices were the basic operating units that
conducted the business of transferring title. All transactions
relative to the disposal of public land within a declared land
district were handled through its land office by officials
designated as registers, who recorded land applications, and
receivers, who accepted payments for land and issued receipts.
The position of receiver was abolished, July 1, 1925, and the
functions devolved upon the register, whose title was changed to
"manager" by Reorganization Plan No. III of 1946, effective July
16, 1946.
', 
', 
The first of 362 land offices was opened at Steubenville, OH, on
July 2, 1800; the last at Newcastle, WY, on March 1, 1920. The
peak year for land offices was 1890, with 123 in operation. The
subsequent closing of the public domain gradually reduced the
number of land offices, until, in 1933, only 25 offices remained.
Under BLM, the district land offices and their functions were
integrated into regional administrative structures, becoming,
variously, elements (sometimes styled land offices) in the
regional office hierarchies or components of multifunction
district offices. The process was concluded by BLM Circular 2342,
May 2, 1973, which formally discontinued use of the term "land
offices." Records described below include some created by
successor organizational units, but assigned by GLO and BLM to
series begun by district land offices.

', 
', History:',  The Federal Government inherited a substantial public
domain from its predecessor, the government under the Articles of
Confederation. By Article IV, Section 3, Clause 2 of the
Constitution, Congress was empowered "to dispose of and make all
needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other
Property belonging to the United States." In the act establishing
the Treasury Department (1 Stat. 65), September 2, 1789, the
Secretary of the Treasury was authorized "to execute such
services relative to the sale of the lands belonging to the
United States, as may be by law required of him," and the Office
of the Register of the Treasury was designated the agency for the
collection and dispersal of Treasury revenues. The Secretary of
War, in the act establishing the War Department (1 Stat. 50),
August 7, 1789, was made responsible for granting military bounty
lands (lands to which veterans of the Revolutionary War were
entitled by virtue of their military service). Treasury
responsibility for administering the public lands was defined
initially in the Land Act of 1796 (1 Stat. 464), May 18, 1796,
which provided for the orderly survey and sale of lands northwest
of the Ohio River. This responsibility was extended
geographically and amended procedurally by additional land laws
of 1800, 1803, and 1804. The act of 1796 required the Secretary
of State to record and issue patents (titles) to public land. The
General Land Office Act (2 Stat. 716), April 25, 1812, created
the General Land Office (GLO) in the Department of the Treasury
to "superintend, execute, and perform, all such acts and things,
touching or respecting the public lands of the United States,"
including those functions formerly vested in the Secretaries of
War and State. GLO transferred to the newly created Department of
the Interior under provisions of its establishing act (9 Stat.
395), March 3, 1849. GLO and Grazing Service (SEE 49.6)
consolidated to form BLM, 1946. SEE 49.1.

', 
', 
', 
', History:',  A general land law of March 3, 1807 (2 Stat. 449),
directed that mineral (lead) lands on the public domain were to
be reserved from sale and leased to developers. At the request of
Secretary of the Treasury William H. Crawford, on behalf of the
GLO, which had found the demand for leasing insufficiently
productive of revenue, President James Monroe transferred the
function to the War Department, November 29, 1821, where it would
be managed for the benefit of the army's demand for rifle shot.
Secretary of War John C. Calhoun delegated the responsibility to
the Ordnance Department, where the Chief of Ordnance, Col. George
Bomford, responding to the failure of Congress to provide
appropriations to cover the employment of civilians as mineral
agents, initiated the practice, in 1822, of detailing army
officers to superintend the mines. These officers were variously,
and unofficially, styled as "U.S. Mineral Agents" and
"Superintendents, U.S. Lead Mines." Miners' resistance to War
Department oversight was such that President James Polk advised
Congress in his annual message, December 22, 1845, that leasing
was costing the government more to administer than it raised for
the treasury. By an act of July 11, 1846 (9 Stat. 37), therefore,
the leasing policy was abandoned. The lead lands were returned to
the administration of the GLO for disposal under provisions of
general land laws.

the Field Surveying Service (FSS) pursuant to the Civil
Appropriation Act for FY 1911 (36 Stat. 741), June 25, 1910,
which discontinued the practice of contracting for surveys. FSS,
headed after 1925 by the Supervisor of Surveys, who also headed
Division "E" (SEE 49.3.6), organized and headquartered initially
as follows: District 1, MT (Helena, MT); District 2, CO and WY
(Denver, CO); District 3, NE and SD (Neligh, NE); District 4, NM
(Santa Fe, NM); District 5, AZ and CA (Phoenix, AZ); District 6,

ID); District 8, OR (Portland, OR); District 9, AK (Juneau, AK);
and Eastern States (designated District 10, January 1918,
Washington, DC). By 1917, responsibility for WA had been
transferred to District 8, with new headquarters at Olympia, WA.
Effective July 1, 1925, concurrently with the abolishment of the
position of surveyor general (SEE 49.7) and the vesting of all
survey functions in FSS, its assistant supervisors of surveys
became district cadastral engineers in charge of cadastral
engineering districts. On June 1, 1930, District 3 was abolished,
and NE and SD were assigned to District 2. District 1 was closed
on May 1, 1937, and MT went to District 7. On January 1, 1941,
the districts were renumbered 1-8 to close gaps created by the
abolishing of old Districts 1 and 3. A reorganization of January
1, 1946, redesignated the districts as regions, in charge of
regional cadastral engineers, constituted and headquartered as
follows: Region 1, CO, MT, NE, SD, and WY (Denver, CO); Region 2,
AZ, southern CA (San Bernardino Meridian), and NM (Santa Fe, NM);
Region 3, ID, NV, and UT (Salt Lake City, UT); Region 4, northern
CA (Humboldt and Mount Diablo Meridians), OR, and WA (Portland,

By March 1947 GLO's Division "E" (Surveying Division, SEE
49.3.6), headed since 1925 by the Supervisor of Surveys, had been
redesignated BLM's Branch of Engineering and Construction, with a
subordinate Division of Surveys in place by November 1947. By
July 1948 a Division of Engineering (redesignated Division of
Cadastral Engineering, January 1950) under the Chief Cadastral
Engineer had superseded the Branch of Engineering and
Construction, with a subordinate Branch of Surveying by January
1949 (redesignated Branch of Surveys by August 1950). In a
reorganization of BLM approved on January 26, 1954, the Division
of Cadastral Engineering became the Cadastral Engineering Staff
in the Division of Technical Programs. This organization remained
stable through May 1961, but by March 1962 the staff had been
reconstituted as the Division of Engineering. Pursuant to BLM
Order 701, July 23, 1964, the Chief Cadastral Engineer became the
Chief, Division of Engineering. By March 1968 the division
included a Branch of Cadastral Engineering. By Amendment 6 to BLM
Order 701, February 4, 1969, the Branch of Cadastral Engineering
became a separate Division of Cadastral Survey under a Chief of
Cadastral Survey.

FSS itself had been in process of informal redesignation as the
Cadastral Engineering Service (CES) since at least August 1922,
and the term CES had virtually (if unofficially) superseded FSS
by 1940. Secretary's Order 2225, July 15, 1946, implementing the
consolidation of GLO and the Grazing Service to form BLM,
redesignated the Supervisor of Surveys as the Chief Cadastral
Engineer. Although the new bureau initially adopted the
organizational structure of its predecessors, including the CES,
it had by 1947 embarked on a decentralization program that
effectively broke up the CES and placed its regional components
under the immediate authority of BLM regional administrators,
with the Chief Cadastral Engineer in Washington, DC, providing
overall policy guidance.

', 
', 
', History:',  For most of the active period of public land settlement,
district land offices were the basic operating units that
conducted the business of transferring title. All transactions
relative to the disposal of public land within a declared land
district were handled through its land office by officials
designated as registers, who recorded land applications, and
receivers, who accepted payments for land and issued receipts.
The position of receiver was abolished, July 1, 1925, and the
functions devolved upon the register, whose title was changed to
"manager" by Reorganization Plan No. III of 1946, effective July
16, 1946.
', 
', 
The first of 362 land offices was opened at Steubenville, OH, on
July 2, 1800; the last at Newcastle, WY, on March 1, 1920. The
peak year for land offices was 1890, with 123 in operation. The
subsequent closing of the public domain gradually reduced the
number of land offices, until, in 1933, only 25 offices remained.
Under BLM, the district land offices and their functions were
integrated into regional administrative structures, becoming,
variously, elements (sometimes styled land offices) in the
regional office hierarchies or components of multifunction
district offices. The process was concluded by BLM Circular 2342,
May 2, 1973, which formally discontinued use of the term "land
offices." Records described below include some created by
successor organizational units, but assigned by GLO and BLM to
series begun by district land offices.
