			 ', Introduction to
			 the scheme', 
			 ', Government of Odisha launched the scheme in 2010-11 to
             explore
			 ground water resources in hard rock areas of the state. The main objective of
			 the scheme is', 
				', 
				  ', 
					', to provide irrigation
					facilities to small and marginal farmers through installation of deep
					borewells covering cultivated area of minimum two hectare.', 
				  	', 
				  ', 
				', 


					', It was proposed to install
					around 4000 nos of borewell projects each with an ayacut of
					approximately 2 Ha at an estimated cost of approximately Rs 2.5 lakh to
					bring around 8,000 Ha under assured irrigation in both khariff and rabi
					for 2010-11 in 17 districts of the state. Subsequently, the unit cost of
					the borewell was enhanced to Rs. 3.15 lakh during the year
                    2012-13 and to  Rs.3.64 lakh  during 2013-14.Now
                    it has been enhanced to Rs. 3.88 Lakh during 2015-16 and the facility has been
					extended to  26 districts of the state (18 Non-KBK districts, 8 KBK districts)
					excluding Bhadrak, Kendrapara, Jagatsinghpur and Puri district.',

			 ', Introduction to
			 the scheme', 
			 ', Government of Odisha launched the scheme in 2010-11 to
             explore
			 ground water resources in hard rock areas of the state. The main objective of
			 the scheme is', 
				', 
				  ', 
					', to provide irrigation
					facilities to small and marginal farmers through installation of deep
					borewells covering cultivated area of minimum two hectare.', 
				  	', 
				  ', 
				', 


					', It was proposed to install
					around 4000 nos of borewell projects each with an ayacut of
					approximately 2 Ha at an estimated cost of approximately Rs 2.5 lakh to
					bring around 8,000 Ha under assured irrigation in both khariff and rabi
					for 2010-11 in 17 districts of the state. Subsequently, the unit cost of
					the borewell was enhanced to Rs. 3.15 lakh during the year
                    2012-13 and to  Rs.3.64 lakh  during 2013-14.Now
                    it has been enhanced to Rs. 3.88 Lakh during 2015-16 and the facility has been
					extended to  26 districts of the state (18 Non-KBK districts, 8 KBK districts)
					excluding Bhadrak, Kendrapara, Jagatsinghpur and Puri district.',
