', A ', cargo ship',  or ', freighter',  is any sort of ', ship',  or vessel that carries ', cargo', u", goods, and materials from one port to another. Thousands of cargo carriers ply the world's seas and oceans each year, handling the bulk of ", international trade', . Cargo ships are usually specially designed for the task, often being equipped with ', cranes',  and other mechanisms to load and unload, and come in all sizes. Today, they are almost always built by welded steel, and with some exceptions generally have a life expectancy of 25 to 30 years before being scrapped.', [', citation needed', ]',

', Cargo ships/freighters can be divided into five groups, according to the type of cargo they carry. These groups are:', 
', 
', General cargo vessels', 
', Tankers', 
', Dry ', bulk carriers', 
', Multi-purpose vessels', 
', Reefer ships', 
', 
', General cargo vessels carry packaged items like chemicals, foods, furniture, machinery, motor- and military vehicles, footwear, garments, etc.', 
', Tankers carry petroleum products or other liquid cargo.', 
', Dry bulk carriers carry coal, grain, ore and other similar products in loose form.', 
', Multi-purpose vessels, as the name suggests, carry different classes of cargo \u2013 e.g. liquid and general cargo \u2013 at the same time.', 
', A Reefer (or Refrigerated) ship is specifically designed', [1]',  and used for shipping perishable commodities which require ', temperature-controlled', , mostly ', fruits', , ', meat', , ', fish', , ', vegetables', , ', dairy products',  and other ', foodstuffs', .', 
', Specialized types of cargo vessels include ', container ships',  and ', bulk carriers',  (technically tankers of all ', sizes',  are cargo ships, although they are routinely thought of as a separate category). Cargo ships fall into two further categories that reflect the services they offer to industry: liner and tramp services. Those on a fixed published schedule and fixed tariff rates are cargo liners. Tramp ships do not have fixed schedules. Users charter them to haul loads. Generally, the smaller shipping companies and private individuals operate tramp ships. Cargo liners run on fixed schedules published by the shipping companies. Each trip a liner takes is called a voyage. Liners mostly carry general cargo. However, some cargo liners may carry passengers also. A cargo liner that carries 12 or more passengers is called a combination or passenger-cum-cargo line.',

', 
', 
', The earliest records of waterborne activity mention the carriage of items for trade; the evidence of history and archaeology shows the practice to be widespread by the beginning of the 1st millennium BC, and as early as the 14th and 15th centuries BC small Mediterranean cargo ships like those of the 50 foot long (15 - 16 metre) ', Uluburun ship',  were carrying 20 tons of exotic cargo; 11 tons of raw copper, jars, glass, ivory, gold, spices, and treasures from Canaan, Greece, Egypt, and Africa. The desire to operate trade routes over longer distances, and throughout more seasons of the year, motivated improvements in ship design during the ', Middle Ages', .', 
', Before the middle of the 19th century, the incidence of ', piracy',  resulted in most cargo ships being armed, sometimes quite heavily, as in the case of the ', Manila galleons',  and ', East Indiamen', . They were also sometimes escorted by ', warships', .', 
', Piracy', [', edit', ]', 
', Further information: ', Piracy', 
', Piracy',  is still quite common in some waters, particularly in the ', Malacca Straits', , a narrow channel between ', Indonesia',  and ', Singapore',  / ', Malaysia', , and cargo ships are still commonly targeted. In 2004, the governments of those three nations agreed to provide better protection for the ships passing through the Straits. The waters off ', Somalia',  and ', Nigeria',  are also prone to piracy, while smaller vessels are also in danger along parts of the ', South American', , ', Southeast Asian',  coasts and near the ', Caribbean Sea', .', [2]', [3]',

A Delmas container ship unloading at the Zanzibar port in Tanzania', 
', 
', 
', The words ', cargo',  and ', freight',  have become interchangeable in casual usage. Technically, "cargo" refers to the goods carried aboard the ship for hire, while "freight" refers to the compensation the ship or ', charterer',  receives for carrying the cargo.', 
', Generally, the modern ocean shipping business is divided into two classes:', 
', 
', Liner business: typically (but not exclusively) container vessels (wherein "general cargo" is carried in 20 or 40-foot containers), operating as "common carriers", calling a regularly published schedule of ports. A common carrier refers to a regulated service where any member of the public may book cargo for shipment, according to long-established and internationally agreed rules.', 
', Tramp-tanker business: generally this is private business arranged between the shipper and receiver and facilitated by the vessel owners or operators, who offer their vessels for hire to carry bulk (dry or liquid) or break bulk (cargoes with individually handled pieces) to any suitable port(s) in the world, according to a specifically drawn contract, called a ', charter party', .', 
', 
', Larger cargo ships are generally operated by ', shipping lines', : companies that specialize in the handling of cargo in general. Smaller vessels, such as ', coasters', , are often owned by their operators.', 
', Vessel prefixes', [', edit', ]', 
', A category designation appears before the vessel's name. A few examples of prefixes for naval ships are "USS" (United States Ship), "HMS" (Her/His Majesty's Ship), "HMCS" (Her/His majesty's Canadian Ship) and "HTMS" (His Thai Majesty's Ship), while a few examples for prefixes for merchant ships are "RMS" (Royal Mail Ship, usually a passenger liner), "MV" (Motor Vessel, powered by ', diesel', ), "MT" (Motor Tanker, powered vessel carrying liquids only) "FV" Fishing Vessel and "SS" (Screw Streamer, driven by propellers or screws, often understood to stand for ', Steamship', ). "TS", sometimes found in first position before a merchant ship's prefix, denotes that it is a ', T', urbine ', S', teamer. (For further discussion, see ', Ship prefixes', .)', 
', Famous cargo ships', [', edit', ]', 
', Famous cargo ships include the ', Liberty ships',  of ', World War II', , partly based on a British design. Liberty ship sections were ', prefabricated',  in locations across the United States and then assembled by shipbuilders in an average of six weeks, with the record being just over four days. These ships allowed the Allies to replace sunken cargo vessels at a rate greater than the ', Kriegsmarine', u"'s ", U-boats',  could sink them, and contributed significantly to the war effort, the delivery of supplies, and eventual victory over the ', Axis',  powers.', 
', Size categories', [', edit', ]', 
', Cargo ships are categorized partly by cargo capacity, partly by weight (', deadweight tonnage',  DWT), and partly by dimensions. Maximum dimensions such as length and width (', beam', ) limit the canal locks a ship can fit in, water depth (', draft', ) is a limitation for canals, shallow straights or harbors and height is a limitation in order to pass under bridges. Common categories include:', 
', 
', Dry Cargo
', 
', Small Handy size', , carriers of 20,000-28,000 ', DWT', 
', 
', Seawaymax', , 28,000 ', DWT',  the largest vessel that can traverse the ', St Lawrence Seaway',  These are vessels less than 740 feet (225.6 m) in length, 78 feet (23.8 m) wide, and have a draft less than 26.51 feet (8.08 m) and a height above the waterline no more than 35.5 metres (116 ft).', 
', 
', 
', Handy size', , carriers of 28,000-40,000 ', DWT', 
', Handymax', , carriers of 40,000-50,000 ', DWT', 
', Panamax', , the largest size that can traverse the original locks of the ', Panama Canal', , a 294.13 m (965.0 ft) length, a 32.2 m (106 ft) width, and a 12.04 m (39.5 ft) draft as well as a height limit of 57.91 m (190.0 ft). Limited to 52,000 ', DWT',  loaded, 80,000 ', DWT',  empty.', 
', Neopanamax', , ', upgraded Panama locks',  with 366 m (1,201 ft) length, 55 m (180 ft) beam, 18 m (59 ft) depth, 120,000 ', DWT', [4]', 
', Capesize', , vessels larger than Suezmax and Neopanamax, and must traverse the ', Cape of Good Hope',  and ', Cape Horn',  to travel between oceans', 
', Chinamax', , carriers of 380,000-400,000 ', DWT',  up to 24 m (79 ft) draft, 65 m (213 ft) beam and 360 m (1,180 ft) length; these dimensions are limited by port infrastructure in China', 
', 
', 
', Wet Cargo
', 
', Aframax', , oil tankers between 75,000 and 115,000 ', DWT', . This is the largest size defined by the ', average freight rate assessment',  (AFRA) scheme.', 
', Q-Max', , liquefied natural gas carrier for ', Qatar',  exports. A ship of Q-Max size is 345 m (1,132 ft) long and measures 53.8 m (177 ft) wide and 34.7 metres (114 ft) high, with a shallow draft of approximately 12 m (39 ft).', [5]', [6]', 
', Suezmax', , typically ships of about 160,000 ', DWT', , maximum dimensions are a beam of 77.5 m (254 ft), a draft of 20.1 m (66 ft) as well as a height limit of 68 m (223 ft) can traverse the ', Suez Canal', 
', VLCC',  (Very Large Crude Carrier), ', supertankers',  between 150,000 and 320,000 ', DWT', .
', 
', Malaccamax', , ships with a draft less than 20.5 m (67.3 ft) that can traverse the ', Strait of Malacca', , typically 300,000 ', DWT', .', 
', 
', 
', ULCC',  (Ultra Large Crude Carrier), enormous supertankers between 320,000 and 550,000 ', DWT', 
', 
', 
', 
', 
', TI-class supertanker',  is an Ultra Large Crude Carrier, with a draft that is deeper than Suezmax, Malaccamax and New Panamax. This causes Atlantic/Pacific routes to be very long, such as the long voyages south of Cape of Good Hope or south of Cape Horn to transit between Atlantic and Pacific oceans.', 
', Lake freighters',  built for the ', Great Lakes',  in North America differ in design from sea water going ships because of the difference in wave size and frequency in the lakes. A number of these ships are larger than Seawaymax and cannot leave the lakes and pass to the Atlantic Ocean, since they do not fit the locks on the ', Saint Lawrence Seaway', .', 
', Pollution', [', edit', ]', 
', Due to its low cost, most large cargo vessels are powered by ', bunker fuel',  also known as ', Heavy Fuel Oil',  which contains higher sulphur levels than diesel.', [7]',  This level of pollution is accelerating:', [8]',  with bunker fuel consumption at 278 million tonnes per year in 2001, it is projected to be at 500 million tonnes per year in 2020.', [9]',  International standards to dramatically reduce sulphur content in marine fuels and nitrogen oxide emissions have been put in place. Among some of the solutions offered is changing over the fuel intake to clean diesel or marine gas oil, while in restricted waters and ', Cold Ironing',  the ship while it is in port. The process of removing sulphur from the fuel impacts the viscosity and lubricity of the marine gas oil though, which could cause damage in the engine fuel pump. The fuel viscosity can be raised by cooling the fuel down.', [10]',  If the various requirements are enforced, the ', International Maritime Organization', u"'s marine fuel requirement will mean a 90% reduction in sulphur oxide emissions;", [11]',  whilst the ', European Union',  is planning stricter controls on emissions.', [12]',

', Specialized types of cargo vessels include ', container ships',  and ', bulk carriers',  (technically tankers of all ', sizes',  are cargo ships, although they are routinely thought of as a separate category). Cargo ships fall into two further categories that reflect the services they offer to industry: liner and tramp services. Those on a fixed published schedule and fixed tariff rates are cargo liners. Tramp ships do not have fixed schedules. Users charter them to haul loads. Generally, the smaller shipping companies and private individuals operate tramp ships. Cargo liners run on fixed schedules published by the shipping companies. Each trip a liner takes is called a voyage. Liners mostly carry general cargo. However, some cargo liners may carry passengers also. A cargo liner that carries 12 or more passengers is called a combination or passenger-cum-cargo line.',

', 
', 
', The earliest records of waterborne activity mention the carriage of items for trade; the evidence of history and archaeology shows the practice to be widespread by the beginning of the 1st millennium BC, and as early as the 14th and 15th centuries BC small Mediterranean cargo ships like those of the 50 foot long (15 - 16 metre) ', Uluburun ship',  were carrying 20 tons of exotic cargo; 11 tons of raw copper, jars, glass, ivory, gold, spices, and treasures from Canaan, Greece, Egypt, and Africa. The desire to operate trade routes over longer distances, and throughout more seasons of the year, motivated improvements in ship design during the ', Middle Ages', .', 
', Before the middle of the 19th century, the incidence of ', piracy',  resulted in most cargo ships being armed, sometimes quite heavily, as in the case of the ', Manila galleons',  and ', East Indiamen', . They were also sometimes escorted by ', warships', .', 
', Piracy', [', edit', ]', 
', Further information: ', Piracy', 
', Piracy',  is still quite common in some waters, particularly in the ', Malacca Straits', , a narrow channel between ', Indonesia',  and ', Singapore',  / ', Malaysia', , and cargo ships are still commonly targeted. In 2004, the governments of those three nations agreed to provide better protection for the ships passing through the Straits. The waters off ', Somalia',  and ', Nigeria',  are also prone to piracy, while smaller vessels are also in danger along parts of the ', South American', , ', Southeast Asian',  coasts and near the ', Caribbean Sea', .', [2]', [3]',

', 
', 
', The words ', cargo',  and ', freight',  have become interchangeable in casual usage. Technically, "cargo" refers to the goods carried aboard the ship for hire, while "freight" refers to the compensation the ship or ', charterer',  receives for carrying the cargo.', 
', Generally, the modern ocean shipping business is divided into two classes:', 
', 
', Liner business: typically (but not exclusively) container vessels (wherein "general cargo" is carried in 20 or 40-foot containers), operating as "common carriers", calling a regularly published schedule of ports. A common carrier refers to a regulated service where any member of the public may book cargo for shipment, according to long-established and internationally agreed rules.', 
', Tramp-tanker business: generally this is private business arranged between the shipper and receiver and facilitated by the vessel owners or operators, who offer their vessels for hire to carry bulk (dry or liquid) or break bulk (cargoes with individually handled pieces) to any suitable port(s) in the world, according to a specifically drawn contract, called a ', charter party', .', 
', 
', Larger cargo ships are generally operated by ', shipping lines', : companies that specialize in the handling of cargo in general. Smaller vessels, such as ', coasters', , are often owned by their operators.', 
', Vessel prefixes', [', edit', ]', 
', A category designation appears before the vessel's name. A few examples of prefixes for naval ships are "USS" (United States Ship), "HMS" (Her/His Majesty's Ship), "HMCS" (Her/His majesty's Canadian Ship) and "HTMS" (His Thai Majesty's Ship), while a few examples for prefixes for merchant ships are "RMS" (Royal Mail Ship, usually a passenger liner), "MV" (Motor Vessel, powered by ', diesel', ), "MT" (Motor Tanker, powered vessel carrying liquids only) "FV" Fishing Vessel and "SS" (Screw Streamer, driven by propellers or screws, often understood to stand for ', Steamship', ). "TS", sometimes found in first position before a merchant ship's prefix, denotes that it is a ', T', urbine ', S', teamer. (For further discussion, see ', Ship prefixes', .)', 
', Famous cargo ships', [', edit', ]', 
', Famous cargo ships include the ', Liberty ships',  of ', World War II', , partly based on a British design. Liberty ship sections were ', prefabricated',  in locations across the United States and then assembled by shipbuilders in an average of six weeks, with the record being just over four days. These ships allowed the Allies to replace sunken cargo vessels at a rate greater than the ', Kriegsmarine', u"'s ", U-boats',  could sink them, and contributed significantly to the war effort, the delivery of supplies, and eventual victory over the ', Axis',  powers.', 
', Size categories', [', edit', ]', 
', Cargo ships are categorized partly by cargo capacity, partly by weight (', deadweight tonnage',  DWT), and partly by dimensions. Maximum dimensions such as length and width (', beam', ) limit the canal locks a ship can fit in, water depth (', draft', ) is a limitation for canals, shallow straights or harbors and height is a limitation in order to pass under bridges. Common categories include:', 
', 
', Dry Cargo
', 
', Small Handy size', , carriers of 20,000-28,000 ', DWT', 
', 
', Seawaymax', , 28,000 ', DWT',  the largest vessel that can traverse the ', St Lawrence Seaway',  These are vessels less than 740 feet (225.6 m) in length, 78 feet (23.8 m) wide, and have a draft less than 26.51 feet (8.08 m) and a height above the waterline no more than 35.5 metres (116 ft).', 
', 
', 
', Handy size', , carriers of 28,000-40,000 ', DWT', 
', Handymax', , carriers of 40,000-50,000 ', DWT', 
', Panamax', , the largest size that can traverse the original locks of the ', Panama Canal', , a 294.13 m (965.0 ft) length, a 32.2 m (106 ft) width, and a 12.04 m (39.5 ft) draft as well as a height limit of 57.91 m (190.0 ft). Limited to 52,000 ', DWT',  loaded, 80,000 ', DWT',  empty.', 
', Neopanamax', , ', upgraded Panama locks',  with 366 m (1,201 ft) length, 55 m (180 ft) beam, 18 m (59 ft) depth, 120,000 ', DWT', [4]', 
', Capesize', , vessels larger than Suezmax and Neopanamax, and must traverse the ', Cape of Good Hope',  and ', Cape Horn',  to travel between oceans', 
', Chinamax', , carriers of 380,000-400,000 ', DWT',  up to 24 m (79 ft) draft, 65 m (213 ft) beam and 360 m (1,180 ft) length; these dimensions are limited by port infrastructure in China', 
', 
', 
', Wet Cargo
', 
', Aframax', , oil tankers between 75,000 and 115,000 ', DWT', . This is the largest size defined by the ', average freight rate assessment',  (AFRA) scheme.', 
', Q-Max', , liquefied natural gas carrier for ', Qatar',  exports. A ship of Q-Max size is 345 m (1,132 ft) long and measures 53.8 m (177 ft) wide and 34.7 metres (114 ft) high, with a shallow draft of approximately 12 m (39 ft).', [5]', [6]', 
', Suezmax', , typically ships of about 160,000 ', DWT', , maximum dimensions are a beam of 77.5 m (254 ft), a draft of 20.1 m (66 ft) as well as a height limit of 68 m (223 ft) can traverse the ', Suez Canal', 
', VLCC',  (Very Large Crude Carrier), ', supertankers',  between 150,000 and 320,000 ', DWT', .
', 
', Malaccamax', , ships with a draft less than 20.5 m (67.3 ft) that can traverse the ', Strait of Malacca', , typically 300,000 ', DWT', .', 
', 
', 
', ULCC',  (Ultra Large Crude Carrier), enormous supertankers between 320,000 and 550,000 ', DWT', 
', 
', 
', 
', 
', TI-class supertanker',  is an Ultra Large Crude Carrier, with a draft that is deeper than Suezmax, Malaccamax and New Panamax. This causes Atlantic/Pacific routes to be very long, such as the long voyages south of Cape of Good Hope or south of Cape Horn to transit between Atlantic and Pacific oceans.', 
', Lake freighters',  built for the ', Great Lakes',  in North America differ in design from sea water going ships because of the difference in wave size and frequency in the lakes. A number of these ships are larger than Seawaymax and cannot leave the lakes and pass to the Atlantic Ocean, since they do not fit the locks on the ', Saint Lawrence Seaway', .', 
', Pollution', [', edit', ]', 
', Due to its low cost, most large cargo vessels are powered by ', bunker fuel',  also known as ', Heavy Fuel Oil',  which contains higher sulphur levels than diesel.', [7]',  This level of pollution is accelerating:', [8]',  with bunker fuel consumption at 278 million tonnes per year in 2001, it is projected to be at 500 million tonnes per year in 2020.', [9]',  International standards to dramatically reduce sulphur content in marine fuels and nitrogen oxide emissions have been put in place. Among some of the solutions offered is changing over the fuel intake to clean diesel or marine gas oil, while in restricted waters and ', Cold Ironing',  the ship while it is in port. The process of removing sulphur from the fuel impacts the viscosity and lubricity of the marine gas oil though, which could cause damage in the engine fuel pump. The fuel viscosity can be raised by cooling the fuel down.', [10]',  If the various requirements are enforced, the ', International Maritime Organization', u"'s marine fuel requirement will mean a 90% reduction in sulphur oxide emissions;", [11]',  whilst the ', European Union',  is planning stricter controls on emissions.', [12]',
