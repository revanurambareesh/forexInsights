                                ', A  bill banning slaughter of cattle imposed in Maharashtra earlier this month not  only made lives of beef eaters in Mumbai and other cities extremely tough, but has  threatened to revive old tensions between social, religious and political  communities. Yet, for Russia and other countries importing Indian meat, the ban  on local sales and consumption of beef in Maharashtra is not a reason to worry,  Mumbai-based exporters say. As India ', exports buffalo meat', , not beef (meat of  cow and its progeny), the ban will not affect the exports.',   ', Beef and buff',   ', A  cow is considered a sacred animal in Hinduism, which is practiced by about 80  per cent of India\u2019s population.  Beef is  consumed by Christians, Muslims and other religious minorities, including those  within the fold of Hinduism. Beef, irrespective of its origin, be it cow,  bullock or buffalo, has always been the cheapest meat, and the only meat  affordable for the poor.',   ', The  Indian constitution provides states with exclusive powers to legislate the  prevention of slaughter and preservation of cattle. There are only a few  states, including Arunachal Pradesh, Kerala and some North-East states,  with no restriction for cattle slaughter, according to Department of Animal  Husbandry & Dairy of the Ministry of Agriculture. Most states ban the  slaughter of cow and its progeny, including bulls and bullocks of all ages,  while some allow the slaughter of cattle with restrictions like a  "fit-for-slaughter" certificate issued on the bases of various  factors like age and continued economic viability. ',   ',  ',  ',   ',  Indian enterprises are allowed to supply buffalo meat to Russia  ',   ',   ', Maharashtra  Animal Preservation (Amendment) Bill signed by India\u2019s President Pranab  Mukherjee on March 3 has been pending for approval for last 20 years. The bill  imposes Rs 10,000 (US$ 60) fine and imprisonment up to five years upon  violators.',   ', Although  the slaughter of cows and calves in Maharashtra as well as in most of other  Indian states was banned under the Animal Preservation Act, 1976 the new bill  extended the ban on slaughter to bulls and bullocks. The bill does not cover  water buffaloes whose meat is considered being of inferior quality. India has  been exporting buffalo meat for past four decades. ',   ', Russian beef market',   ', Despite  the beef ban being one of the most discussed issues in India for past two  weeks, Russia\u2019s veterinary regulator Rosselkhoznadzor (Federal Service for  Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance) claims to have no information on any  beef ban from the Indian authorities. ',   ', Few  month back the regulator appointed an expert who conducted check-ups of  conducing abattoirs and meat factories in different states. According to the regulator\u2019s  spokesperson, the export will control both production and dispatch of meat that  is to be exported to Russia from four Indian companies, approved by the Russian  regulator in December last year. ',   ', The  list of approved companies includes Maharashtra-based Frigerio Conserva Allana  Limited and Frigorifico Allana Limited, both subsidiaries of Allana Group,  India\u2019s largest meat exporter, and two companies from Uttar Pradesh, Fair  Expors Pvt.Ltd and Amroon Foods Pvt. Ltd.',   ', In  an e-mail interview with RIR, Aaziz Latif, CEO of Allanason Pvt Ltd, said the beef  ban in Maharashtra would not affect the company\u2019s plans to export deboned and  deglanded frozen buffalo meat to Russia. ',   ', \u201cAllanasons  and its two abattoir establishments, Frigerio Conserva Allana Private Limited  and Frigorifico Allana Private Limited, approved by the Russian authorities  will be able to conduct exports to Russia as per plan,\u201d Latif said. \u201cWe see  excellent scope to cater to Russia\u2019s requirement by exporting risk free, lean,  nutritious buffalo meat from selected, specifically approved state of the art  abattoir establishments, which will ensure excellent quality and  traceability.\u201d ',   ',    ',      ',   ', Read section:',  Business Beat',   ',   ', According  to Russian Federal Customs Service (FSC), meat imports in Russia in 2014  recorded more than 1 million tonnes or US$ 4,271 million. In January and  February 2015, Russia imported meat worth US$ 58 million and US$118 million  respectively from non-CIS foreign countries. Beef imports accounted for US$ 17.7 million in January and US$ 50.3 million  in February, more than 50 per cent drop compared to the same period in 2014.',   ', Analytical  agency EMEAT estimates the imports of chilled beef to Russia (excusing the  trade within customs union) stood at 2900 tonnes, frozen beef at 12,300 tonnes,  beef by-products at 11,900 tonnes as on 1st March, 2015. The total import of  chilled beef to Russia in January-February 2015 dropped 76,2 per cent to 900  tonnes, as compared to the same period of 2014, frozen beef imports reduced by  63,8 per cent to 15,400 tonnes and beef by-products fell 61,2 per cent to  23,900 tonnes. ',   ', Russia  has been reducing meat imports aimed at reaching meat self-sufficiency during  several years.  In January-February 2014,  beef imports dropped 27,1% (chilled beef), 31,3% (frozen beef) ad 15,4%  (be-products) as compared to the same period of 2013. Currently, the leading  importer of bovine meat to Russia is Brazil. It supplied 12,200 tonnes within  January-February 2015, more than 50 per cent down from the same period of 2014.  ',   ', Chance for India',   ', According  to a report by FICCI, a premier industry body in India, Indian buffalo meat is  one of the largest agricultural exports (by value) in the country, after guar,  rice and seafood. India has been exporting frozen buffalo meat to over 65  countries, including the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei, Mauritius and Seychelles.  Last year, according to Federation of Indian  Export Organisations, India replaced Vietnam as the world\u2019s largest supplier of  buffalo meat in global markets. The buffalo meat exports have been rising by 25-40  per cent annually and are expected to reach $6 billion in 2015.',   ', Until  recently, Indian buffalo meat was not present in the Russian market as a result  of the ban imposed by Rosselkhoznadzor due to some phytosanitary issues.  According to Latif, buffalo meat is already  exported to many CIS and ex-USSR countries like Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan,  Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Armenia and Georgia.',   ', Sergey  Yushin, head of National Meat Association of Russia (NMA), believes it is  difficult to say what market share the Indian  buffalo imports may gain. \u201cThis product is not yet known either to meat  processing plants or to retail stores. We don\u2019t yet know how manufacturers of  cooked meats and sausages will appreciate the consumer properties of buffalo\u201d. ',   ',  ',   ',   ', u" India's food exports finding niche in Russia",   ',   ', Experts  says the competition among beef exporting countries is increasing due to a drop  in the meat consumption in Russia that affects imports.  He added that, according to provisional data,  the prices for buffalo will not be lesser than for beef from South America; thus  many importers may prefer working with trusted suppliers rather than braking  networks they had been building for past many years. ',   ', \u201cThere  is a high level of trust between Russian importers and South American exporters  while India is yet a new and unfamiliar partner. There are fears of contracts  being disrupted, of possible deviations of quality and range,\u201d he says, adding  that one should not expect easy and quick gains in Russian market.',   ', Yushin  points out, however, that beef tariff rate quota (TRQ) for  \u201cother countries\u201d group (which includes India) are 418,000 tonnes, out of which  frozen beef TRQ is 407,000 tonnes. \u201cThere is something to fight for,\u201d he says.',
