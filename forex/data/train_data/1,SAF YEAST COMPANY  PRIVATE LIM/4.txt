    the manufacture of yeast.   Lesaffre family set up the manufacture 
    of yeast in France around the year 1873.  Muthu met Alain Laloum 




                                                            
    in   an   international   fair   in   Germany,   sometime   in   May   1980. 
    Muthu was keen to have a joint venture with Lesaffre.  SAF Yeast 
    was   incorporated   on   3   August   1981,   pursuant   to   an   agreement 




                                               
    dated 6 June 1981, between Lesaffre and Muthu.   At the relevant 
                                   
    time,   due   to   restrictions   in   India   regarding   foreign   investment, 
    Lesaffre was not in a position to set up a 100% subsidiary or to 
                                  
    hold majority shares.   It was therefore provided in the agreement 
    dated 6 June 1981 that in the event the laws of India are amended 
    and   it   is   made   legally   permissible   to   hold   the   majority   interest, 
        


    Muthu   would   transfer   the   necessary   shares   to   Lesaffre   or   its 
     



    subsidiary, and that they would then hold majority of equity capital. 
    When SAF Yeast was incorporated, the word 'SAF' was derived from 
    the name Lesaffre and the interim license agreement was entered 





    into between Lesaffre and SAF Yeast on 11 December 1982, after 
    obtaining   requisite   approvals.     Lesaffre   was   issued   6000   equity 
    shares comprising of 40% of equity capital.   On 22 March 1991, 





    Lesaffre and Muthu entered into a participation agreement to up-
    date   the   agreement   of   6   June   1981.   ", Article   6',    of   participation

    Calyon Bank was something that could be used to their advantage 
                                     
    by placing Nafan in difficulties.  Muthu started his attempts to force 
    Lesaffre to sell 51% shares held by Nafan so that he could control 
                                    
    SAF   Yeast.     The   minutes   of   the   meeting   of   14   April   2005   were 
    incorrectly recorded and when it was pointed out, Muthu disputed 
    the position.  Correspondence ensued between the parties. Alain De 
           


    Gouy  informed   Muthu   that  on  Lesaffres intervention, the  Calyon 
        



    Bank was agreeable to certain terms and conditions.  Alain De Gouy 
    asserted  that   Lesaffre   was not   acting  against  the  interest   of SAF 
    Yeast and it was not a shareholders' dispute.

    that   he   was   being   forced   to   take   certain   decisions   in   respect   of 
    Calyon   Bank,   clearly   trying   to   make   out   a   case   against   Nafan. 
    Nafan  never  attempted to order Muthu  in  this regard and acted 
    only to ensure that the decisions were taken in the best interest of 
    SAF Yeast.   Muthu purportedly held a Board meeting on 26 July 
    2005, without any notice to the nominee Directors of Nafan where

    meeting,   if   held,   was   void.     The   deletion   of   Nafans   name   from

    Group,   and   Muthu   in   particular   were   oppressive,   fraudulent, 
    unjust, and unfair.  They had acted contrary and against the Articles 





    of Association and the Participation Agreement of SAF Yeast.  They 
    acted   in   breach   of   fiduciary   duty.   Nafan   had   lost   confidence   in

    partnership between two groups; Nafan was no longer in position 
    to carry on business with the Muthu Group as a business partner.

    The allegations made against Sharp & Tannan, statutory auditors 




                                                                                   
    are baseless and denied.   The SAF Yeast furnished a copy of the 
    MOU   dated   29   January   2009   to   the   statutory   auditors.     It   was 




                                                          
    recorded   in   the   memorandum   that   Muthu   Group   would   buy 
    shareholding in Nafan  and SAF Yeast and fair valuation is to be 




                                                         
    done by the auditors.   Since Sharp & Tannan were the statutory 
    auditors, after request was made to carry out the valuation, Sharp 
    & Tannan issued certificate of valuation on 9 February 2009.  Since 




                                             
    there   was   an   urgency,   the   valuation   report   was   prepared 
                                   
    expeditiously. It was forwarded to Laloum under cover of its letter 
    dated 10 February 2009.

',     10.    In   response   to   the   query   raised   by   Foreign   Exchange 
    Department of Reserve Bank of India, Sharp & Tannan confirmed 
        


    that it had followed Controller of Capital Issues ( CCI) guidelines 
     



    for valuation of equity shares of the Company.   It is incorrect to 
    state that the valuation is a scrap of paper, without sanctity and 





    validity.  It is denied that the valuation is fraudulent or ridiculously 
    low or there has been any collusion.  It is denied that the valuation 
    was carried out to cause wrongful loss to Nafan and give advantage 





    to the Muthu Group.

',     11.    Sharp & Tannan has nothing to do with the dispute, as it was 
    never a party to any decision for deletion of the name of Nafan 
    from the members register.

    experience in production, distribution, and use of yeast in baking 
    and production of alcohol.   He was instrumental in setting up a 
                                  
    brewery and a yeast factory for his past employer - Shaw Wallace & 
    Co.     He   met   Laloum   in  May   1980   at   an   exhibition   and   Laloum 
    showed   interest   in   setting   up   a   factory   in   India   since   he   had 
        


    connections   with   India.     He   was   impressed   with   Muths 
     



    knowledge.    Lasaffre  Group had no experience  of manufacturing 
    yeast outside of Europe or any experience of using 100% yeast, and 





    of the Indian conditions.  They, therefore, had no option but to tie 
    up with someone like Muthu.   A joint venture was formed on 6 
    June 1981.  SAF Yeast was incorporated on 12 August 1981.  There 





    were three Directors, Muthu, B.B. Paymaster, and Lucian Lesaffre. 
    Muthu was the Managing Director right from the inception.  It was 
    the obligation of the Lesaffre Group to provide technical assistance, 
    which they failed to do.

    banks and gave personal guarantees.   Lesaffre Group did not give 




                                                              
    any such guarantee.   When the factory became functional, it was 
    found that strength of yeast given by Lesaffre was unsuitable and 




                                                             
    Lesaffre   had   rendered   no   technical   assistance   or   advise.     Muthu 
    made efforts to get the correct strength.  As the factory at Chiplun 
    progressed, a second factory was set up at Sandhila through efforts 




                                                 
    of Muthu.  The assertion of Nafan that the name SAF comes from 
                                     
    Lesaffre   is   not   correct.     The   participation   agreement   dated   22 
    March   1991   was   not   to   be   acted   unless   the   clauses   were 
                                    
    consequential   to   the   Articles   of   Association.     The   participation 
    agreement was never in accordance with the Articles of Association.

    the   parties   always   acted   in   accordance   with   the   Articles   of 
    Association.       Several   Board   meetings   were   held   in   India   when 





    none   of   the   Lesaffre   nominees   attended   and   in   spite   of   this 
    position, the decisions were accepted.  This was because Articles of 
    Association clearly stipulated that for Board meeting held in India, 





    there   is   no   requirement   to   give   notice   to   the   Directors   based 
    outside India.

    was executed on 19 March 1993 in furtherance of the agreement 




                                                         
    dated 19 October  1981.   This agreement dealt  with dividend by 
    SAF  Yeast  to  Lesaffre   Group.   The  Government  of India through 
    Ministry   of   Industries   approved   increase   of   the   shareholding   of

    regarding   foreign   exchange   dividend   payment   were   laid   down. 
    Sometime in the year 1996, Lesaffre requested SAF Yeast to obtain 
                                  
    molasses from one Ganesh Benzoplast for exporting it to Lesaffre 
    Group.     Certain   dispute   arose   between   SAF   Yeast   and   Ganesh 
    Banzoplast.     Arbitration   proceedings   were   filed.     Initially,   the

    Yeast owed fiduciary duty to SAF Yeast and not to Calyon Bank.  He

    relationship with Calyon Bank at the cost of SAF Yeast.   He also

                     SAF   Yeast   requested   Sharp   &   Tannan   on   9   February 
    2009 to work out the fair value of equity shares of SAF Yeast as on 
                                   
    31 March 2008.  Sharp & Tannan carried out valuation exercise and 
    valued the equity shares of SAF Yeast at `4315/- per share.  Laloum 
    telephoned Muthu on 10 February 2009 about the valuation report 
        


    and   Muthu   informed   him   that   Sharp   &   Tannan   would   send   it 
     



    shortly.     Thereafter   Sharp   &   Tannan   sent   their   certificate   of 
    valuation on 11 February 2009 to Laloum with a copy to Meurant. 
    Muthu sent an e-mail to Meurant with a copy to Laloum about the 





    further   steps   taken   pursuant   to   the   MOU.     Muthu   tried   to   call 
    Meurant   on   several   occasions   from   11   February   2009   to   18 
    February 2009 but Meurant was not available in the office.  Laloum 





    informed   Muthu   that   Nafan   could   not   locate   the   original   share 
    certificate.  Between March and April 2009, Muthu took the matter 
    of transfer of shares pursuant to the MOU and copy to Laloum and 
    Corinne Wisniewski regarding the steps of process for completing 
    the transaction.

    the   MOU   being   a   binding   agreement   to   transfer   the   share,   is

    convinced Muthu to agree to postponement of hearing to give more 
    time from the perspective of Nafan to settle differences regarding

    that Laloum's decision would be placed before Lesaffre family that

    this meeting is already set out in the affidavit of Laloum.   What

    was given to the assertion of Muthu regarding MOU.  The valuation 
    sent along with letter dated 10 February 2009 was addressed to 
                                   
    Laloum and not to Lesaffre  or Nafan.   The valuation was at the 
    instance of SAF Yeast.   If the Auditor had addressed the valuation 
    to Lesaffre, they could not have made a ridiculously low valuation.

    manner in which the valuation was carried out and the speed at 





    which it was carried out was entirely suspicious.  The valuation was 
    done by Nafan from reputed firms of Chartered Accountants would 
    show that the valuation of SAF Yeast was wholly fraudulent.  Even

    stated   to   have   been   addressed   to   Muthu,   A.M.Arunachalam   and

    and Muthu.  The Articles of Association were specifically called for. 
    Thereafter the MOU was executed.  Laloum did not appear to be in 
                                    
    any physical discomfort.   After the shares were transferred, there 
    was   no   question   of   withdrawing   the   proceedings   before   the 
    Allahabad High Court since transfer of shares was subjudice in the

',     The   valuation   done   by   Sharp   &   Tannan   was   proper   and   after 
    considering all the relevant material.  No capital can be made of the 
    fact that valuation was prepared in a short time span.  The Sharp & 





    Tannan are auditors for around 27 years and therefore they were 
    fully aware of the finances.  The criticism made on the valuation is 
    based on incorrect figures.  Lesaffre Group in the past had accepted 





    the valuation of the auditors without questioning the basis or the 
    integrity of the valuers.

    the   Nafan   had   not   suppressed   material   and   vital   facts,   and   the 
    petition was not liable to be dismissed on that count.   The MOU 




                                                           
    was   not   obtained   by   fraud   or   inducement   and   Laloum   had   the

    shareholdings vide the MOU.   It was held that Muthu Group took 
                                   
    immediate steps for withdrawal of the cases at their end.  The MOU 
    was not bad on the ground of uncertainty in terms and conditions. 
',                                   
',     The Board held that it was competent to take into consideration the 
    intention of the parties from the MOU to pass appropriate orders in 
    exercise of its rights and powers under ', Section 402',  of the Act.   A 
        


    transfer notice must fulfill both the conditions stipulated in ', Article 
     



    15', , that, it must be a notice of the members desire to transfer the 
    shares and it must appoint the Company as an agent for finding a 
    transferee.     The   first   part   of  ', Article   14',   is separate,  distinct,  and 





    independent of latter part of ', Article 14',  and that the contention of 
    Muthu Group that Articles 15 and 18 are applicable is incorrect. 
    Board   further   held   that   the   MOU   was   not   a   transfer   notice   as 





    contemplated under ', Article 15.',    The Board held that the meeting 
    on 29 January 2009 was held and the allegation of fabrication of

    nominee   directors  in   terms  of  the  Participation  Agreement.   The 
    meeting therefore was bad in law.  The Board also held that, even 




                                                          
    assuming   that   participation   agreement   was   not   binding,   it   was 
    obligatory to give notice when entire 51% shares were transferred.

',     The   meetings   were   therefore   illegal   for   want   of   notice.   Board 
    however   held   that   the   meeting   dated   29   January   2009   was   not 
    oppressive because it was in terms of the MOU.   The Board held 




                                             
    that the meetings held on 23 and 25 May 2009 were bad in law 
                                   
    since no notice was served and no agenda was circulated, and they 
    were   oppressive     The   Board   came   to   the   conclusion   that   the 
                                  
    valuation prepared by Sharp & Tannan was not reliable.  Valuation 
    report was a got up document and biased.   The valuation report 
    deliberately   used   CCI   Guidelines   though   they   were   inapplicable. 
',         


',     The  Board  held  that   there  was no request  in writing by Laloum 
     



    regarding  the  duplicate share certificates and that ', Article  18',  did 
    not authorize the Company to carry out any transfer in absence of 
    original share certificates.  The Board further concluded that the act 





    of issuance of duplicate share certificates was part of a design to 
    usurp the shareholding of Nafan.  The Board accordingly concluded 
    that   Nafan   succeeded   in   proving   the   case   of   oppression   by   the 





    Muthu Group.

',     (IV)  The Board thereafter considered the grant of relief.  It noted 
    that, it was apparent that two groups could not run the Company 
    together.     Parting of  ways and sale  of shares from one group to

    the   contribution   of  Muthu,  equity  and  humanitarian   perspective,

    aside.  The meetings dated 29 January 2009, 23 May 2009, and 25 
    May 2009 were declared as non-est, illegal and void.   Nafan and 
                                   
    Lesaffre   were   directed   to   transfer   the   shares   to   Muthu   Group 
    proportionate to their shareholding.  To carry out a fair valuation, 
    the Board of Directors was suspended and kept in abeyance.  Until 
        


    the valuation was concluded, an administrator was appointed.  The 
     



    administrator   so   appointed   was   authorized   to   appoint   an 
    independent auditor.  After the complete exit of Nafan and Lesaffre 
    of receiving the consideration, the administration function would 





    come to an end.   Accordingly, the Company Petition was disposed 
    of by the impugned order dated 28 March 2013.

    sell its shareholding. It declares that the MOU executed by Laloum

    impugned order specifically contains references and directions to

    Once there is a specific direction in a order to a person   to transfer 
    his shareholding it will be  hyper-technical to hold that such person 





    is not even entitled to file an appeal.  What needs to be seen is the 
    direction to the person concerned.  The legality or otherwise of the

    Muthu   Group   before   the   Board   was   that   Nafan   was   nominee   of 
    Lesaffre and Nafan is not separate and distinct from Lesaffre. Even 




                                                          
    the case of Muthu Group before the Board indicates that Lesaffre 
    can   be   considered   as   a   person   aggrieved.    In   the   facts   and 
    circumstances, therefore, the appeal filed by Lesaffre needs to be 




                                                
    considered on merits along with the appeal filed by Nafan.  When 
                                   
    Mr.   Dwarkadas   had   initially   raised   the   contention   regarding 
    maintainability of the appeal filed by Lesaffre,  it was kept open to 
                                  
    be decided at the time of final order and Mr. Khambata on behalf of 
    Lesaffre   has   made   the   submissions   on   merits   as   well.     I   am 
    therefore not inclined to dismiss the Appeal No.24 of 2015 filed by 
        


    Lesaffre only on the ground of maintainability. Lassafre is entitled 
     



    to   contend   that   the   directions   issued   to   it   should   be   set 
    aside.However a positive relief,if any, can only be granted to Nafan 
    as per its prayers in the petition.

    dealings   in   the   affairs   of   the   Company.     Oppression   can   be   in 
    different forms.     Something, which is illegal may not always be 





    oppressive   and   something   which   is   legal   may   be   oppressive.     A 
    deliberate act to cause harm to the members of the Company in

    than only testing only the legality of the actions.

    to avoid taking a stand on oath.   This objection does not survive 
    once the concerned persons i.e. Laloum and Lesaffre have put forth 
        


    their stand on oath and have taken a responsibility as to what is 
     



    stated   in   those   affidavits.     Simplicitor   dismissing   the   Company 
    Petition   on   that   ground   alone   would   have   only   meant   that   the 
    petition would have been filed again with same allegations for the 





    same   reliefs,   which   would   only   multiply   the   litigation.     In   the 
    circumstances, I am not inclined to interfere with the finding of the 
    Board that the Petition ought not to have been dismissed on this 





    count.

    material documents and material facts despite them being within

    also shown that the new products were developed using indigenous 
    technology and the technology not of Nafan.   He submitted that 
    even notes of accounts for the year 2001 to 2003 have not been

', u"    43.    I have considered the submissions.  Firstly, what is the exact 
    case made out by Nafan in this petition needs to be seen.  The relief 




                                                              
    sought by Nafan is that the register of members should be rectified 
    by inserting the name of Nafan in respect of 80,772 shares and an 




                                                             
    order   terminating   the   appoint   of   Mr.Muthu   as   the   Managing 
    Director and that Muthu Group be directed to sell their shares to 
    Nafan.     In   the   petition,   the   Nafan   has   pleaded   the   relevant 




                                                
    particulars.   It has placed on record the particulars of the parties, 
                                   
    the backdrop to the joint venture.  Then it stated that Muthu Group 
    is   attempting   to   prohibit   Nafan   from   participation   in   the 
                                  
    management.     It   is   attempting   to   compel   transfer   of   Nafan's 
    shareholding.  Muthu Group is committing acts of mismanagement. 
    It has inserted the name of Muthu Group as a shareholder of 51% 
        


    of   Nafan   although   Nafan   has   executed   no   share   transfer   deed. 
",      



',     Then, Nafan gives background how the dispute arose between the 
    parties is given by narrating the events that transpired leading to 
    litigation between SAF Yeast and Calyon Bank and the contempt 





    petition   filed   in   the   Allahabad   High   court   and   thereafter 
    proceedings in the Apex Court.   Nafan alleged that Muthu Group 
    failed   to   give   statutory   records,   minutes   of   Board   meetings, 





    financial   statements,   then   it   made   a   grievance   of   holding   Board 
    meetings   without   notice,  failure   to   provide   documents   regarding 
    litigation   and   how   in   spite   of   the   attempt   to   settle   the   dispute 
    settlement did not come through.  Thereafter Nafan has mentioned 
    how   Lucien   Lesaffre   received   a   notice   from   the   Registrar   of

    Companies to show cause regarding non-filing of returns.   It has 




                                                                                      
    then mentioned that Laloum informed Lesaffre and Corinne that he 
    has   been   induced   to   sign   some   papers   by   Muthu   and   he   has 




                                                              
    received some valuation addressed to SAF Yeast, which shows that 
    the valuation had no sanctity.  Then Nafan refers to a MOU stating 




                                                             
    that Nafan was not a party and cannot be aware of the same.  Then 
    it stated that around 28 May 2009, Muthu sent a letter stating that 
    shares are transferred relying on the MOU.  It is stated that Nafan 




                                                
    never agreed to sale its shares.  It is further stated that if the MOU 
                                   
    is produced, Nafan will raise and plead all its objections thereto.  It 
    is then stated that when the Board meeting was held at Paris on 29 
                                  
    May 2009 and the agenda was sent to Muthu, Muthu fraudulently 
    called   alleged   meeting   on   25   May   2009,   made   deposit   of   some 
    amount, and in accordance with ', Article 18',  struck off the name of 
        


    Nafan.     This   was   done   based   on   the   alleged   MOU   and   the 
     



    valuation, which were fraudulent.   Therefore, the entire thrust of 
    Nafan in the manner in which Muthu removed their names without 
    notice to them in a meeting. According to them, the MOU was not a 





    valid document and Nafan had never agreed to sell its shares.   It 
    had   specifically   stated   that   if   the   MOU   were   produced,   Nafan 
    would make its submission and take objections accordingly.

    Montreux   have   not   been   mentioned   at   all   in   the   petition.     The 
    fundamental aspect of the acts of oppression is meetings without 
    notice and the transfer of shares.   There is no correspondence on

    record from Nafan or Lesaffre stating that they will abide by MOU 




                                                                                      
    and it should be placed before the Board, nor is a specific share 
    transfer   notice   given   by   Nafan.     The   entire   argument   of   Mr. 




                                                              
    Dwarkadas   on   this   count   is   based   on   the   silence   on   the   part   of 
    Nafan and Lesaffre Group regarding the MOU and enquiry about 




                                                             
    valuation.  According to him, once Nafan was made aware that the 
    MOU   exists   and   will   be   enforced,   then   by   not   taking   any   steps, 
    Muthu   was   right   in   believing   that   the   MOU   was   accepted.

', u"    According to Nafan, Muthu Group was trying to divert the course of 
                                   
    adjudication towards the legality, validity and binding effect of the 
    MOU, but from Nafan's point of view in the petition the real issue 
                                  
    in   the   matter   was   the   oppressive   nature   of   the   Board   meetings 
    through which the transfer of share have taken place.  
",         


',     45.    The Lesaffre and Nafan had made it clear through the e-mail 
     



    written by Corinne Wisniewski that the valuation was ridiculously 
    low.   Whatever may be the stand of Nafan and Lesaffre regarding 
    the MOU, apart from making general enquiries regarding valuation, 





    there   were   no   further   steps   taken   by   them   for   execution   of   the 
    MOU.  In fact, they had specifically made their intention clear that 
    they will not be going to do so in view of the valuation.  The MOU 





    did specify that there would be fair valuation and withdrawal of the 
    Court proceedings.  Therefore, according to Nafan, the MOU had to 
    be worked upon and taken further by both sides, rightly or wrongly, 
    which aspect is dealt with later.  The case of  Nafan in the petition 
    was   clear   that   it   not   ready   to   go   by   the   MOU.     They   did   not

    consider   it   as   a   valid   piece   of   document.   This   case   is   clearly 




                                                                                     
    reflected in the petition.  Therefore, the primary grievance of Nafan 
    that the way the meetings were held in which share transfer took 




                                                            
    place   without   notice   to   them   amounts   to   oppression.     It   is   the 
    Muthu Group, which is seeking, relies on the binding effect of the 




                                                           
    MOU.     The   contention   of   Mr.   Dwarkadas   is   that   the   MOU   is   a 
    binding   contract   and   non-disclosure   of   events   surrounding   the 
    transaction amount to suppression amongst others.

           For the purpose of examining the charge of suppression, even 
    assuming   the   MOU   was   binding,   the   action   of   Muthu   Group   to 
                                  
    transfer the shares without notice to them still could be questioned 
    by Nafan, which they did in the petition.   For that purpose, it is 
    enough   to   assert   that   the   MOU   had   no   sanctity.     There   is   no 
        


    complete omission to mention the MOU.  It is mentioned and it is 
     



    stated  that   it   is   invalid.     Nothing   further   needed  to   be   pleaded. 
    Whether it is binding or not would be the case of Muthu Group. 
    Nafan had reserved its rights to make comments on the MOU.  The 





    MOU is in fact is relied upon in defence of the actions taken by 
    Muthu   Group   to   transfer   the   shareholding   without   notice.     The 
    primary   grievance   of   Nafan   holding   a   meeting   without   notice 





    remains.   It is, therefore, not possible to uphold the contention of 
    Mr.   Dwarkadas   that   the   petition   itself   did   not   contain   cause   of 
    action and the rejoinder sought to supply the same and the petition 
    should   have   been   dismissed   on   that   count.     Nafan   had   clearly 
    reserved the liberty to rejoin in case the MOU is pressed in service

    has held that the pleadings should receive liberal construction and 
    whenever   question   of   law   regarding   the   pleading   is   raised,   the 
    enquiry   should   not   be   about   the   form   of   pleadings,   instead   the 




                                                
    Court must find out whether the parties knew the case and issues 
                                   
    contested.     Once   it   is   found   that,   in   spite   of   deficiency   in   the 
    pleadings,   parties   knew   the   case   and  they   proceeded   to   trial   on 
                                  
    those issues by producing evidence, it would not be open to a party 
    to raise  the  question  of absence  of pleadings.   Before  the Board 
    decided   the   matter,   all   the   parties   had   exhaustively   filed   their 
           


    pleadings   through   petition,   replies,   affidavits,   rejoinders,   sur-

', u"    rejoinders,   etc.   and   the   parties   were   fully   aware   of   each   other's 
    case.   The decision in the case of  Mohta Brothers  (supra) is of no 
    assistance   to   Mr.   Dwarkadas,   as   in   that   decision,   the   Court   was 





    concerned   with   the   subsequent   events   and   held   that   the   matter 
    needs to be decided upon the facts pleaded in the petition.  In the 
    present case, it is a grievance of Nafan that various facts leading to 





    the   meetings   were   suppressed   from   them,   which   they   came   to 
    know after filing of the petition and therefore rejoinder had to be 
    filed.  In this case, not only rejoinder but also sur-rejoinder has also 
    been filed.

    emphasized   by   Mr.   De'   Vitre.     The   Apex   Court   disapproved   the 
    reliance by the High Court on the pleadings made in some other 





    proceedings and ignoring the assertions made by the respondent

    Court in  Sangram Singh (supra) after taking review of the powers 
    of the Board, has in fact emphasised that, looking at the nature of 




                                                 
    the proceedings, the Board will have to take into consideration the

    Petition. The nature of jurisdiction executed by the Board is very 
    different   from   exercised   by   the   courts   trying   civil   suit,   election 
    petition, and writ petition.     It is not necessary to deal with these 
        


    decisions   arising   under   different   jurisdictions,   as   in   the   case   of 
     



    Sangram   Singh   Gaekwad  (supra)   itself,   the   Apex   Court   has 
    emphasized the jurisdiction of the Board under the very provision

    on the ground of suppression of facts, when the facts the Petitioner 
    is supposed to have suppressed were the facts suppressed by the 
                                  
    Respondent from them.   As far as MOU is concerned, Nafan had 
    mentioned the same and made it clear that it is not considering it 
    as valid.  Why it was valid was the defence of Muthu group, which 
        


    they  put   forth.     Nafan  countered that  defence  in  their rejoinder.

',     Persons   concerned   filed   their   affidavits   placing   contested   factual 
    position   on   record.     It   is   not   that   Nafan   obtained   an   ex-parte 
    orderly misleading the Board. Both parties were fully aware of the 





    facts.  When the Board took up the matter for consideration, all the 
    facts were placed before it placed on record either by Nafan or by 
    Muthu Group.  It is after considering the entire record the CLB took 





    an informed decision and to my mind rightly did not dismiss the 
    petition on the ground of suppression of facts.

    pending in the Civil Court.   The Board has also taken note of the 
        


    position of law that it has no power to specifically enforce the MOU 
     



    but   what   the   Board   has   done   is   to   give   effect   of   the   supposed 
    understanding of the parties in the MOU, while passing an order 
    under ', Section 402', u" of the Act.  Mr. De'Vitre and Mr. Khambata have 





    seriously objected  to this submitting that this is indirectly giving 
    specific performance of the contract as the suit itself stands decreed 
    by the order of the Board.  On the other hand, it is the contention 





    of   Mr.   Dwarkadas   that   the   MOU   is   valid,   legal,   binding,   it 
    constitutes   a   transfer   notice,   and   therefore   there   was   no   act   of 
    oppression committed at all.

    transfer the shareholding of Nafan and Lesaffre without notice to 
    them, even when they had made it clear that they were not abiding

    action   when   the   Muthu   Group   came   to   know   that   Nafan   and 




                                                           
    Lesaffre   were   not   going   to   honour   their   so-called   commitments 
    under   MOU   was   to   file   a   civil   suit   or   approach   the   Board   for 
    necessary relief.   The question is whether the Muthu Group could 




                                               
    have done it unilaterally without notice.   There could be various 
                                   
    angles,   such   as,   the   MOU   is   valid,   legal   and   binding,   and   it 
    amounts   to   a   transfer   notice;   the   MOU   is   not   legal,   valid   and 
                                  
    binding, and it does not amount to a transfer notice; the MOU is 
    legal, valid and binding but it does not constitute transfer notice; 
    the intention behind MOU can be taken into consideration while 
        


    passing an order under ', Section 402',  of the Act.  However, there is 
     



    yet another facet.   Should the Muthu Group have given a notice of 
    the Board meeting before transferring the shares on the basis of 
    MOU out of fairness and as a matter of probity?  Though I would 





    proceed to examine these viewpoints, as they have been agitated 
    before me at some length, I am of the opinion that it is the last 
    facet that should be kept at the forefront of the discussion.

', u"    58.    Mr. De'Vitre submitted that the finding that the MOU is valid 
    and binding could not have been made, as the Board does not have 
    jurisdiction to do so.   The MOU was a disputed document and at 
    the most an arrangement amongst the shareholders.  He submitted

    that the Board did not have any power to grant declaration of the 




                                                                                      
    validity, more particularly, since Muthu Group had already filed a 
    civil suit for specific performance.  To hold that the MOU is arrived 




                                                              
    with consent and for consideration and is nothing but to decide on 
    its validity.  He submitted that parties had initiated their respective 




                                                             
    proceedings in competent Courts.  The Muthu Group had initiated 
    civil   suit   in   this   Court   and   Nafan   and   Lesaffre   had   initiated 
    proceedings   in   the   Court   at   Switzerland.     He   submitted   that 




                                                
    dismissal   of   the   suit   in   Switzerland   was   only   on   the   ground   of 
                                   
    jurisdiction.  It was then submitted that, even assuming the Board 
    had jurisdiction, it could not have been directed Nafan and Lesaffre 
                                  
    to sell their shares.   He submitted that the MOU mentioned a fair 
    valuation and withdrawal of proceedings. The valuation was not a 
    fair valuation and Muthu Group had not taken immediate steps to 
        


    withdraw the contempt proceedings.  He submitted that Nafan did 
     



    not   ask   for   invalidation   of   the   MOU,   but   it   was   put-forth   as   a 
    defence by Muthu Group, and it is Muthu Group who is asking for 
    direction based on the MOU, in spite of the fact that they have filed 





    a civil suit.

    petition   itself   it   is   ascertained   by   Nafan   that   the   shares   were 
    transferred   based   on   non-existing   and   non-binding   MOU.     He 
    submitted that since having put up the case that the MOU was not 
    binding, Nafan could not be heard to say that the Board had no 
    jurisdiction to deal with their submission.   He submitted that the

    case pleaded by Nafan is that they were entitled to set aside the 




                                                                                      
    transfer of shares on the allegation that the MOU was not binding. 
    In view of this assertion, the Board had to consider whether the 




                                                              
    MOU was non-existent as alleged and whether Muthu Group was 
    justified on relying on the MOU.   He submitted that the suit was 




                                                             
    filed only to save the limitation and as a precautionary measure 
    and  there  will  be   no  contrary reliefs.     Mr.Dwarkadas submitted 
    that since Nafan had invoked the power under ', Section 402', , it was 




                                                
    open   for   the   Board   to   take   into   account   all   relevant   factors   for 
                                   
    ordering a buyout  to do substantial justice. According to him, the 
    Board   did   not   exceed   its   jurisdiction   as   MOU   and   the   events 
                                  
    leading to the MOU were made part of cause of action by Nafan 
    itself, which is clear from its pleading.   Mr. Dwarkadas submitted 
    that   the   decisions  relied upon   by  De  Vitre  and Mr.Khambatta to 
           


    contend that the Board does not have powers akin to Civil Court, 
        



    are not applicable as they deal with a party approaching the Board 
    seeking relief to enforce a contract.   He submitted in the present 
    case Nafan having entered into a valid and binding MOU has filed a 





    petition   to   resile   from   the   same.     He   further   submitted   that   no 
    party should be allowed to resile from a contract. It was open to 
    the   Board   to   consider   the   MOU   as   one   of   the   relevant 





    circumstances.     He   relied   upon   decision   in   the   case   of  Probir 
    Kumar   Misra   Vs   Ramani   Ramaswamy 16,  rendered   by   Madras 
    High Court, to contend that a MOU can be considered as a relevant 
    circumstance.   Mr.Dwarkadas further submitted that the contempt 
    petition came to be withdrawn within the legal frame work and it

    was   not   entirely   in   the   hands   of   Muthu   group   to   withdraw   the 




                                                                                    
    contempt petition, which had to depend upon orders of the Court. 
    He submitted that theory of Laloum being induced is false.  Nafan 




                                                            
    is changing its stand as regards the MOU, has taken contradictory 
    stand, and ultimately has admitted that the MOU exists.   He then 




                                                           
    relied upon the averments made  in the rejoinder by Nafan and the 
    additional affidavits.  Mr. Dwarkadas referred to various documents 
    on record in detail seeking to demonstrate that the MOU was not 




                                              
    an isolated piece of document but there were series of meetings 
                                   
    and exchange of e-mails, fax messages that led to execution of the 
    MOU. He submitted that the MOU is a clear and binding contract 
                                  
    and if Nafan had to wriggle out the same on the ground of fraud 
    and inducement, the heavy burden was upon it to demonstrate the 
    same.     The   MOU   fulfills   all   the   ingredients   of   being   a   binding 
        


    contract and Laloum who had full authority to do so executed it. 
',      



',     He also submitted that there is no uncertainty or vagueness in the 
    MOU.     It   is   handwritten.   Laloum   carried   out   corrections   and 
    initialed   them.     Laloum   is   an   experienced   business.   He   was 





    commercial   director   of   Lesaffre   group.   There   was   no   special 
    relationship with Muthu that he could have induced Laloum.   He 
    submitted that the conduct of the parties clearly shows that Nafan 





    and Lesaffre were fully aware of the MOU and did not raise any 
    objection, which would have been the first reaction if Laloum had 
    signed a contract without their authority.   He submitted that the 
    entire   conduct   of   Nafan   in   respect   of   this   MOU   is   fraudulent. 
    Mr.Dwarkadas   therefore,   submitted   that   the   primary   object   of

',     60.    I have considered the arguments.  The Board has rendered a 
    finding   that   the   MOU   is   not   an   invalid   and   unenforceable 




                                                           
    document,   it   is   not   obtained   by   playing   fraud   on   Laloum,   and 
    Laloum   was   authorised   to   sign   the   MOU.     The   Board   also 




                                               
    concluded   that   the   MOU   was  not   vague   and  Muthu   fulfilled   his 
    obligations.   It also held that the MOU is made by free consent. 
',                                    
',     The   Board   relied   upon   the   decision   of  Bihar   State   Electricity 
                                  
    Board Vs Green Rubber Industries  -AIR 1990 SC P 693 to hold 
    that even though the party is ignorant of precise legal effect, it is 
    bound by the terms of contract it signs.   The Board distinguished 
        


    the decision cited by Nafan to hold that the Board can take note of 
     



    intention of parties and pass appropriate orders.   The Board also 
    took   note   of   the   argument   on   behalf   of   Muthu   group   that   the 
    agreement has already been implemented and therefore, question 





    of enforceability does not arise.
', 

',     61.    The Board has culled out an intention of the parties from the 





    MOU. It concluded that Nafan, with full knowledge and free will, 
    had   entered  into   a  MOU   for   sale   of   its  shares.   This  intention   is 
    relevant for considering buyout.    Board  accepted the position that 
    a specific performance of the MOU cannot be granted by it ,but has 
    taken the intention of parties into consideration. I do not think this 
    is correct. First, this would be doing granting specific performance.

',     62.    It  is settled that the Board in law does not have power to 
    grant   specific   performance   of   a   contract   between   two   groups   of 




                                                                
    shareholders.     The   powers   of   Board   under   the   Act   are   to   be

    not   to   decide   civil   disputes.     Whether   Lesaffre   agreed   to   sell   its 
                                  
    shareholdings to Muthu group is a dispute between two groups of

    thing is clear that when the Board meetings took place in May 2009

    April 2009, referring to the MOU, Ms. Corinne Wisnieswaski had 
    clearly   replied   on   3   May   2009   that   Nafan   cannot   even   think 




                                                            
    considering   the   price,   which   was   obviously   not   calculated   on 
    correct basis.  In spite of the specific e-mail, the same valuation was 




                                                           
    used to give effect to the MOU.  Therefore, when the act of transfer 
    of   shares   took   place,   the   Nafan   was   not   ready.     The   MOU   did 
    mention that there should be a fair valuation of shares.   The fair 




                                               
    valuation of shares therefore was one of the preconditions of the 
                                   
    MOU.   Naffan had made it clear that the valuation was not fair. 
    Therefore, dispute arose even within the terms of the MOU as to 
                                  
    whether   the   valuation   carried   out   was   fair.     The   amount   of 
    consideration for transfer was not fixed in the MOU.  It was to be 
    arrived   at   upon   a   fair   valuation.     Once   Nafan   insisted   that   the 
        


    valuation was not fair, the consideration could not be termed as 
     



    fixed. A clear civil dispute therefore arose even assuming that the 
    MOU was binding.  Muthu was fully aware that there was a dispute 
    as   regards   the   valuation   and   that   Nafan   was   not   ready   for   the 





    valuation.     In   spite   of   this   position,   meeting   was   held   without 
    notice and shares were transferred.

',     64.    It was contended by Mr.Dwarkadas that Nafan itself put the 
    validity of MOU into issue and therefore it cannot complain that the 
    Board adjudicated upon the same.  He submitted that it is case of 
    Nafan itself that the MOU is not a valid and binding and therefore 
    the Board had to adjudicate upon the same to hold that it is valid,

    binding,   and   properly   executed.     This   submission   cannot   be 




                                                                                   
    accepted.     Nafan   had   come   to   the   Board   making   a   grievance 
    regarding   the   meetings   held   without   notice   wherein   their 




                                                           
    shareholding   was   transferred.     Nafan   had   stated   in   the   petition 
    that, if MOU were relied upon then would reserve their right to 




                                                          
    contest the same.   It is the case of Muthu Group that MOU was 
    binding   and   it   is   wrongly   been   resiled   from   and   the   MOU 
    constituted a transfer notice.  The foundation of the case of Muthu 




                                              
    Group is the MOU and it is their main defence to the allegations of 
                                   
    oppression.    According to Nafan, MOU was at the most a proposal 
    to take the transaction forward and Muthu Group was attempting 
                                  
    to convert this memorandum into a binding contract.
', 

',     65.    Reference was also made by the Board to the decision of the 
        


    High Court in Switzerland in which the High Court has according 
     



    to   the   Board   held   that   the   MOU   is   a   contract.     However,   the 
    observations   and   the   operative   part   of   the   High   Court   order 
    reported in paragraph 82 of the impugned order itself shows that 





    the proceedings were dismissed for want of jurisdiction.  Therefore, 
    the   observations   made   in   the   decision   of   the   High   Court   of 
    Switzerland  could  not   have  been  held  against  Nafan.   The   legal 





    effect of MOU is already being agitated in the Civil Court where the 
    Court will decide its legality and validity. 
', 

',     66.    The question therefore, arises is whether it could be said that 
    the MOU was such a clear unequivocal document that it presented

    an open and shut case, and that a clear intention of Nafan to act on 




                                                                                     
    the MOU followed therefrom and all that had to be done was to 
    only complete the procedural formalities of transfer.   In given case, 




                                                            
    it may be argued that a clear intention flowed from an agreement 
    and for all purpose it was complete and only procedural formality 




                                                           
    remained and therefore the board even though cannot enforce the 
    agreement can look at the intention.  However, the present case, in 
    my   opinion,   cannot   be   pitched   at   that   level.     Can   an   absolute 




                                               
    conclusion can be drawn that the MOU was a concluded contract 
                                   
    with full knowledge, it has been acted upon and after it is acted 
    upon   only   a   procedural   formality   remains   and   at   that   stage   a 
                                  
    grievance is being made by Nafan.
', 

',     67.    The question therefore is whether Nafan and Lesaffre had no 
        


    case at all to dispute that they are not bound by the MOU and a 
     



    clear intention emerged.  Thus if they have a prima facie case that 
    the MOU was not to be acted upon and that theory is reasonably 
    possible then appropriate course of action  for Muthu group would 





    be to pursue their rights in the Civil Court. 
', 

',     68.    I have already concluded that there is no suppression on the 





    part of Nafan and the entire material on record is to be considered. 
    The MOU therefore, is now on record.  According to Muthu Group, 
    the MOU was a culmination of series of meetings.  Laloum had the 
    authority   to   sign   the   MOU   and   therefore,   it   is   complete   in   all 
    respects.   The   explanation   of   Nafan   and   Lesaffre   regarding   the 
    events   surrounding   the   MOU   is   through   the   affidavits   of   Denis

    Lesaffre and Laloum.  According to Laloum, the document i.e. MOU 




                                                                                 
    was only initiation of negotiation talks.  Both parties were to take it 
    forward. According to both Laloum and Mr.Lesaffre, this was at the 




                                                         
    best, a rough proposal to end the dispute.  Mr.Lesaffre has put on 
    record   that   when   they   came   to   know   about   the   valuation   they 




                                                        
    immediately concluded that the price indicated in the MOU was so 
    ridiculous that the proposal could not be taken forward.   Muthu 
    had   also   not   withdrawn   the  contempt   proceedings.    Laloum  has 




                                              
    stated that Lesaffre being a family business, the consent of family 
                                   
    members ought to have been taken.  
',                                   
',     69.    Looking at the version put up by Nafan, I do not feel that the 
    theory   put   forward   by   Nafan   and   Lesaffre   that   MOU   was   a 
    document   to   explore   possibility   of   settlement   could   be   rejected 
        


    outright as absurd.   After signing of the MOU there are no steps 
     



    taken by Nafan except to inquire about the valuation.   Once the 
    valuation was informed to Nafan and Lesaffre, their reaction was 
    that  the  valuation   was ridiculous.   The manner and the  form in 





    which   the   document   stood   executed   and   the   reaction   to   the 
    valuation  and  in  normal course  of business to transfer shares, it 
    could not be said that an unquestionable intention flowed from the 





    MOU.  Therefore, the Board even though it came to the conclusion 
    that Laloum had the authority to sign the contract did not consider 
    that fair valuation was one of the ingredients and after coming to 
    know   that   valuation   was   not   fair,   Nafan   and   Lesaffre   had   no 
    interest in taking the MOU forward.   Therefore, the Board fell in

', u"    70.    Both Muthu group as well as Nafan and Lesaffre are assisted 
    by   administrative   and   legal   staff,   as   their   correspondence   would 
    show.     In   normal   business   transactions,   solicitors   and   legal 




                                                         
    professionals  will  draw documents for transfer of shares.   Drafts 
    would be exchanged.   The understanding would be reduced to a 




                                              
    formal   documentation.    There  may   be   meetings  at   both   ends   to 
    finalise the decisions, there would be negotiations, discussions on 
                                   
    the price. Before the drafts are finalized, the parties could back out 
                                  
    for legitimate or otherwise reasons. If any steps were to be taken 
    before   completion   of   the   documents,   they   would   be   discussed 
    specifically.  This would be the practice followed in routine business 
        


    transactions.  In the present case, entire 51% shareholding of Nafan 
     



    is sought to be transferred. The value of the same clearly exceeds 
    millions of Euros.   It is difficult to believe  prima facie  that Muthu 
    and Laloum would simply write out the entire transaction by hand 





    on a small piece of paper in a hotel and part ways deciding that 
    51% shareholding is sold, and nothing further is needed, and  the 
    agreement   stood   concluded,   and   it   constituted   a   transfer   notice 





    which Muthu will unilaterally execute.   One may advance lengthy 
    legal   arguments   regarding   what   is   meant   by   a   contract   and   the 
    binding effects etc, but any reasonable man would say, in today's 
    age of commercialism and professionalism, this   is not the way of 
    two business groups of this level ,dealing with such high stakes,

    will conclude the transaction.  The theory put-forth by Laloum that

    business   and   therefore   cannot   be   rejected   outright;   more 
    importantly, no unquestionable intention can be culled out from it.

    Lesaffre family decides.   This also cannot be a fanciful version, as 
    Lesaffre is a family business.

           Therefore, it could not be said that the petition was filed by 
    only to resile out of the clear binding contract.   They had placed 
                                  
    their stand on record that they have no intention to take the MOU 
    forward.     Since   the   same   MOU   was   interpreted   to   derive   an 
    intention to order a buyout, it was nothing but indirectly granting 
        


    specific performance of the contract by the Board.  It cannot be that 
     



    Board concludes that it has no power to grant specific performance 
    of the agreement yet it will enter into disputed areas of intention of 
    parties  in  respect   of  the  said contract  adjudicated as to whether 





    intention exists and then give effect to the intention.    This is not 
    to lay down an absolute proposition then even in a case that all 
    ingredients   of   contract   are   satisfied   only   procedural   formalities 





    remain, both parties take all possible steps to see that the contract 
    is to be executed even in such circumstances the Board cannot take 
    entry of unquestionable intention.   The Board has in fact in para 
    165 of the impugned order rightly distinguished the case of Probir 
    Kumar Misra  (supra) relied upon by Mr.Dwarkadas, holding that

    in that case both the parties had substantially acted on the MOU, 




                                                                              
    but in the present case, it is not so.  In the present case, there is a 
    dispute between the parties.  Stand is taken by Nafan and Lesaffre 




                                                      
    that they had absolutely no intention to take any steps based on the 
    MOU considering the valuation.  Once their stand was clear , was 




                                                     
    prima facie tenable, it was not open for the Board to dissect the 
    MOU, take out the intention and use while passing an order under

',     72.    Mr.Dwarkadas   made   a   grievance   that   Nafan   was   changing 
                                   
    their stand regarding the status of the MOU at every stage.  Firstly, 
                                  
    they did not accept its validity and then when they had to accept it, 
    they  called  it   a  neutral  document. I am not  impressed with this 
    submission.  To my mind, the MOU is nothing but a red herring to 
        


    divert the controversy.   Assuming MOU exists, it is the manner in 
     



    which the shareholding of Nafan has been transferred which is the 
    crux of the dispute.

',     73.    Furthermore, there was another contingency in the MOU i.e. 
    withdrawal of contempt proceedings by Muthu group. The Board 
    has observed that Muthu group took immediate steps to withdraw 





    the contempt proceedings and it was not in the hands of the Muthu 
    group to withdraw the contempt proceedings.   It has been placed 
    on record that after the MOU there were 22 dates in the Courts and 
    at the stage of rejoinder arguments that the contempt petition was 
    withdrawn.   The Board has therefore, fallen in clear error to hold 
    that immediately after signing the MOU the contempt proceedings

    were withdrawn.  A stand is taken on behalf of Muthu group that

',     Therefore,   even   assuming   Laloum   signed   the   MOU   and   Laloum 
    had an authority to sign the MOU it is not possible to conclude that 




                                                                
    the MOU was complete in all respects and was at such a stage that 
    even notices of its execution was not necessary.  In addition, there 
    is one aspect that is more important.  The MOU is being discussed 




                                                   
    in the context of oppression.   One thing was clear was that when 
                                   
    the board meeting on 25 May 2009 took place, Muthu was fully 
    aware that Nafan was not ready for the valuation and for going 
                                  
    forward with the transfer of shares.  Therefore, as far as Muthu is 
    concerned Nafan was not ready to act as per the MOU.  It is with 
    this knowledge that MOU is taken forward by Muthu. Though it is 
        


    contended by Mr.Dwarkadas that in spite of sending the MOU there 
     



    was no response and it must be presumed that Nafan and Lesaffre 
    had   no   objection,   it   is   too   nave   to   believe   that   in   spite   of   the 
    acrimony   that   existed  at   that  point  of  time   between  the  parties, 





    Muthu   would   innocently   believe   that   Nafan   and   Lesaffre   were 
    ready to go by the valuation prepared by M/s Sharp & Tannan and 
    all that remained was formality of transfer for which no notice was 





    necessary.     Therefore,   MOU   did   not   spell   out   a   clear   and 
    unequivocal intention to transfer the shares.  Therefore, though the 
    Board was right in considering that MOU could not be specifically 
    enforced, erred in relying on intention, which did not exist while 
    passing an order under ', Section 402', .  The question of the validity of

    the MOU has to be left to the Civil Court and I am of the opinion 




                                                                                               
    that the version of the Nafan regarding the MOU can be termed as 
    so absurd that they can be ordered to sell out their shares based on 




                                                                       
    the so-called intention under the MOU.   Furthermore, the crux of 
    the   matter   is   the   manner   in   which   the   meetings   took   place.

    of Nafan and Lesaffre, that the meeting dated 29 January 2009 did 
    not   take   place   and  the   meetings   were   fabricated,  the   Board   has 
    rendered a finding of fact that the meeting in fact was held and the 





    minutes were not fabricated.   The Board has concluded that the 
    charge of fabrication is akin to fraud and heavy burden lies upon 
    the party to make such allegation.   It is the contention of Mr.De' 
    Vitre that the minutes inter-se show complete inconsistencies.  It is

    the   contempt   proceedings.   However,   as   rightly   observed   by   the 
    Board that merely because there are contradictions in the minutes 
    does   not  per   se  lead   to   the   conclusion   that   the   minutes   are 




                                                
    fabricated.     The   failure   to   communicate   the   resolutions   and 
                                   
    minutes may amount to act of oppression and/or mismanagement, 
    but from this omission itself, it cannot be stated that the minutes 
                                  
    themselves   were   fabricated.     The   Board   has   taken   a   view   that 
    grounds provided by Nafan were not sufficient enough to prove the 
    charge   of   fabrication   which   required  high   degree   of   proof.    The 
        


    finding of the Board after scrutinising the evidence and considering 
     



    the burden of proof cannot be termed as perverse to be interfered 
    with   under   ', Section   10F',    of   the   Act.   What   is   legal   effect   of   the 
    meetings is of course open for consideration.

                Directors did not approach the shareholders with the view of  
                obtaining   their   shares.   The   shareholders   approached   the  
                                  
                Directors and named the price at which they were desirous

                members of their company in directing and managing the

                made  to them collectively. If the Directors mismanage the  
                company's   affairs,   they   incur   liability   to   pay   damages   or  
                compensation to the company or to make restitution to it,  
                but individual members cannot recover compensation for the  





                loss they have respectively suffered by the consequential fall  
                in   value   of   their   shares,   and   they   cannot   achieve   this  
                indirectly by suing the Directors for conspiracy to breach the  
                duties which they owed the company. However, there may be  
                certain situations where Directors do owe a fiduciary duty  
                and a duty to exercise reasonable skill and care in advising

    agreement   has   not   been   disputed   and   it   was   acted   upon.     The 
        

    Participation agreement was not unlawful, it was never cancelled,

    years that the participation agreement was executed. The relevant

    agreement can never be contrary to the Act as well as Articles of 
    Association.     However,   I   do   not   think   an   elaborate   discussion   is 
    necessary,   as   the   clause,   which   gives   an   additional   safeguard   of 
    notice, is not in conflict with the Act and the Articles of Association.

           Mr. De'Vitre, on the other hand, has countered each of the 
    assertions   of   Mr.Dwarkadas   and  contended  that  the  Participation 
                                  
    Agreement   was   acted   upon.     He   submitted   that   as   per   the

    shareholding,   additional   shares   were   offered.     Muthu   continued 
        


    beyond the expiry of 15 years.  Though Articles of Association did 
     



    not specify that meetings to be  held outside India, they were so 
    held under ", Article 7.10(a)',  of Participation Agreement and pointed

    evidence in the limited jurisdiction under ', Section 10-F', , to find out 
    the   exact   manner   and   which   circumstance   can   be   attributed   to

    the parties in terms of the Participation agreement took no steps at 
    all.  The Participation agreement existed.  Both the parties entered

    into   it.     Some   steps   were   taken   pursuant   to   the   Participation 




                                                                                    
    agreement   and   it   did   not  remain   only  a dead  letter. The  Muthu 
    group knew that the Participation agreement required notice to the 




                                                            
    directors   outside   India.     The   stand   of   Muthu   group   that   neither 
    Articles of Association nor the Act required that notice be given, 




                                                           
    apart from not being tenable, is not reasonable.  The argument that 
    in the past no such notices were given is also not tenable.   The 
    decision of exit of one group and bringing the association, which 




                                              
    existed   for   decades   to   an   end,   was   one   of   the   most   important 
                                   
    decision for SAF Yeast.  It was not an ordinary routine business to 
    be transacted.   Neither the Articles of Association nor ', Section 286',  
                                  
    prohibited issuance of notice  for such decision. The Participation 
    agreement   contemplated   issuance   of   notice.   Ultimately,   the 
    allegations of all acts of oppression are rooted more in fairness than 
        


    in   legality.     Once   the   Participation   agreement   existed   and   it 
     



    contemplated   issuance   of   notice,   it   was   only   reiteration   of   the 
    obvious, which is otherwise a requirement.  In fairness, the notice 
    ought to have been given.  It is the most unfair stand to be taken 





    that   the   Articles   of   Association   were   not   amended   to   include 
    Participation   agreement   even   though   it   was   acted   upon   in   same 
    manner,  and therefore, no notice  before  transfer of shareholding 





    was   required   to   be   given.     Such   argument   defies   all   notions   of 
    fairness.

    of   Association,   parties   knew   its   existence   and   the   fact   that   the 




                                                                                     
    Participation   Agreement   required  a   notice   to   the   Directors   to   be 
    given outside India. The Board rightly observed that since this term 




                                                            
    was not contrary to the Articles, and the Act, Muthu Group was not 
    entitled to  say  that  it  need not give  notice  because  Participation 




                                                           
    Agreement   was   not   part   of   the   Articles   of   Association. 
    Furthermore,   it   is   the   case   of   the   Nafan   and   Lesaffre   that   the 
    incorporation   of   Participation   Agreement   into   Articles   of 




                                               
    Association had to be done by Muthu.   When both the groups co-
',                                    
',     existed for more than 20 years and the meetings were to determine 
    the exit of one group, that too in acrimonious circumstances, notice 
                                  
    was required. Neither in the Articles of Association nor in ', Section 
    286',  nor in any decision dealing with the similar factual situation at 
    hand, has it been stated that it is not necessary to give notice in 
        


    such circumstances.  The findings of the Company Law Board that 
     



    the meetings of 29 January 2009, 23 May 2009 and 25 May 2009 
    were illegal for want of notice cannot be termed, as perverse. The 
    Company Law Board has also rightly taken note of the fact that the 





    agenda   of   the   meeting   was   not   circulated.     The   agenda   is   not 
    produced on record for the meetings of 29 January 2009, 23 May 
    2009, and 25 May 2009.  This is an additional ground.

    May   2009   were   illegal   and   oppressive.     As   regards   the   meeting 
    dated 29 January 2009, the Board has held that it is illegal but not 
    oppressive as it was as per MOU.  This finding is not correct.  The

    meeting of 29 January 2009 cannot be read in isolation.  The series 




                                                                                         
    of acts of Muthu constituted ground of oppressive. It was a larger 
    scheme   of   things.   If   notice   had   been   issued,   Nafan   would   have 




                                                                
    either placed their version regarding MOU or agreed on some basic 
    principles of valuation.   Muthu seem to have in hurry to call for 




                                                               
    valuation   as   the   events   unfolded,   which   have   been   discussed 
    subsequently, such as, the role of Sharp & Tannan.  The meeting of 
    21 January 2009 also has to be held as oppressive apart from being 




                                                  
    illegal.     The   finding   of   the   Board   to   that   effect   will   have   to   be 
    modified.

',     87.    Next heads of debate are whether the MOU could be treated

    of valuation of shares by the valuer.   I have already held that the 
        


    holding of these meetings without notice to the Nafan and Lesaffre 
     



    was illegal, unfair, and oppressive and the findings of the Company 
    Law Board on that count are not perverse, except the modification 
    above.  However, the main argument advanced by the Muthu group 





    is that the MOU was a transfer notice and transfer was effected as 
    per   the   Articles.   Question   then   arises   is   whether   the   MOU 
    constituted a transfer notice.   The learned counsel advanced the 





    detailed   submissions   on   the   interpretation   of   the   articles   to 
    demonstrate   that   the   MOU   can   be   treated   as   a   transfer   notice. 
    There   was   also   a   question   as   to   whether   the   transfer   between 
    member   to  member   is   covered  by  first  part   of  ', Article   14',   of   the 
    Articles of Association and the applicability of Articles 15, 18, 19

    15',  and ', 19',  will apply only to a transfer to a non-member is incorrect 
    as seen from the scheme of the Articles.  He submitted that right to 
    transfer shares is not unfettered and the ', Article 14',  makes it clear

    that   even   transfer  inter-se  between   members   is   regulated   in   the 




                                                                                          
    manner   provided   by   the   Articles.     He   contended   that   Articles 
    contemplate transfer notice by A Person proposing to transfer any 




                                                                  
    shares and ', article 15',  applies even to a member-to-member transfer. 
    He   submitted   that   the   Articles   14   to   22   would   have   to   be   read 




                                                                 
    harmoniously.     According   to   Mr.Dwarkadas   ', Article   16',    has   no 
    application   in   the   case   of  transfer   between   members  inter-se.   As 
    regards ', Article 17',  read with ', Article 15', , according to Mr.Dwarkadas 




                                                   
    it would be in a case where there is a disagreement of the price of 
                                   
    shares to be transferred.  ', Article 19',  according to him applies only 
    where the proposed transferor has not contracted to sell his shares 
                                  
    to another member.  He contended that last sentence in ', Article 22', u" 
    contains words 'these articles' being in plural will apply event to 
    member   to   member   transfer.       According   to   Mr.Dwarkadas, 
           


    combined  reading  of  Articles as scheme  is to facilitate a smooth 
        



    expeditious transfer of shares by a member and it is for this reason 
    that   the   Articles   provide   for   distinct   schemes.     Irrespective   of 
    whether the transfer is between the members, which is covered by 





    first   part   of   ", Article   14',    it   has   to   read   with   15,   17,   18,   and   22. 
    Mr.Dwarkadas   placed   reliance   on   the   decision   of  Holmes   and

    fundamentals.  First, the articles will have to be read as a document 
    drafted   by   businessperson   to   conduct   their   affairs.     Second,   any 
    restriction in the articles must be spelt out with sufficient clarity.  If 





    we   read   ', Article   14',    plainly,   first   part   says   that   a   member   may 
    transfer  the   shares  or   other person  is  entitled  to transfer  to any 
    member selected by the transferor.  This part covers a contingency 
    of a transfer of share by a member entitled to transfer to any other 
    member.   In case of a public limited company listed on the stock

    exchange, the shares are generally freely transferable.  In a private 




                                                                                     
    limited company share  transfers can have restrictions.   However, 
    normally there is no absolute bar to transfer the shares.  As a broad 




                                                             
    proposition,   generally   law   does   not   recognize   an   embargo   on 
    transfer   of   shares.   The   first   part   of   ', Article   14',    therefore   merely 




                                                            
    reiterates the obvious position that a member can transfer the share 
    to   another   member.   This   obvious   position   is   stated   only   to 
    emphasize the restrictions that follow in the second part of Article 




                                               
',     14.  Second part states that the shares shall not be transferred to a 
                                   
    person who is not a member, as long as any member or any person 
    selected by the directors is willing to purchase the same at a fair 
                                  
    value.  Such embargos are placed in closed held Company to keep 
    them that way, discouraging the outsiders.  The ', Article 15', , 16', , 17',  
    and   ', 18',    thereafter   lay   down   a   methodology   where  the   Company 
        


    gets involved for transfer of shares and steps in as an agent.  There 
     



    is   no   logic   for   going   through   the   entire   process   of   making   the 
    Company an agent if the share transfer is between the members. 
    The   Articles   are   drafted   by   the   businesspersons   to   govern 





    themselves.   When one member decides to transfer the shares to 
    another,   they   would   inform   the   Company.     There   is   no   special 
    reason why in respect of this Company they should go through the 





    entire gamut of making company the agent.  This document simply 
    and clearly contemplates this elaborate machinery for member to 
    non-member transfer.  The reading of the articles need not be made 
    deliberately   complicated   and   opposed   to   common   sense,   merely 
    because such interpretation     justifies the action taken by Muthu

    to be interpreted in a routine manner, any reasonable reader would 
    read them as for member-to-member transfer, there is no question 




                                                            
    of   making   the   Company   agent,   fair   valuation   etc.   The   articles 
    cannot be read in absurd manner or only because reading them in

    finding  of  the  Board  that clause  14 is a distinct scheme  did not 
    subject to restrictions in the other articles, is a possible view to be 




                                              
    taken, and is not perverse.

',     97.    The Articles are not to be read like a statute.  Restrictions on 
    transfer of shares from one member to another have to be specific 
    (see  Greenhalg  (supra)  and   V.B.Rangaraj  (supra).     Restrictions

    were to apply in member-to-member transfer, then the concept of 
    fair value mentioned therein will lead to absurd reasons.   There 
                                   
    could be cases where the members have agreed on a fixed price. 
',                                   
',     Such fixed price will be a fair value for them.  If the interpretation 
    of Mr.Dwarkadas is to be accepted, it will mean fair value has to be 
    fixed only after the Company received the transfer notice.  Then it 
        


    will   be   that   there   will   be   no   contract   of   sale   until   the   transfer 
     



    notice.   Businesspersons  to   regulate  their   affairs   have   framed   the 
    Articles. If they wanted to place restrictions on themselves for inter-
    se transactions by providing a methodology to give notice to the 





    Company to appoint a valuer and fixed fair value, they would have 
    been so specifically provided.  Such interpretation cannot be foisted 
    because   it   validates   the   acts   of   one   group.     The   interpretation 





    placed on these articles has to be seen in the context of charge of 
    oppression of  unilaterally taking MOU as notice  and transferring 
    the shares.  Question therefore is, whether the articles were so clear

    the   pre-emptors;   second:  any   member   willing   to   purchase   the 
        


    shares   at   a   fair   value;  third:  any   person   selected   by   directors;

', 
',     These articles are similar to the ones at hand and, therefore, they 





    have been reproduced in full as above.   The Apex Court analyzed 
    the articles as under :
', 

',                 24.1       The   Articles   give   the   hierarchy   of   the   persons  
                entitled to purchase shares upon transfer. The first right is  
                given   to   the   preemptors   under   ', Article   57-A.',    Next   in   the

                hierarchy   is   any   member   who   is   willing   to   purchase   the  
                shares at a fair value. This follows from a reading of Article  




                                                                                        
                with Article The third category is of any person or persons  
                selected by the Directors as being desirable in the interest of  




                                                                
                the company to admit to membership. The last category is  
                the person to whom the transferor may choose to sell the  
                shares. As long as there is any person in a higher category,  
                there is no question of sale or purchase by a person in a  




                                                               
                lower category. Thus for example the right of a member or a  
                person in the 2nd category to purchase shares can arise only  
                in the event there is a default or refusal on the part of the  
                preemptor and so on. A person may fall within any one or  




                                                  
                more of these four categories and would, by virtue of these  
                articles   have   distinct   and   separate   rights   to   purchase   the  
                                   
                shares in each of the four categories. So even if a preemptor  
                or a nominee of a preemptor does not exercise his/her right  
                                  
                under ', Article 57-A', u" to purchase the shares at a price certified  
                by   the   company's   Auditors,   such   person   may   choose   to  
                exercise the right as an ordinary member and purchase the  
                share at a fair value or the transferor may choose to sell the  
        

                shares to such person under ", Article 63.', 
     



', u"                24.2      In the case of a transfer to a person in the 2nd and  
                3rd   categories   of   putative   purchasers,   the   Directors   are  
                appointed agents of the transferor. The notice of transfer is  





                required   to   constitute   the   Directors   as   the   transferor's  
                agents. This notice is distinct from the other required to be  
                given under ", Article 57-A.',  In respect of these two categories,  
                the price of the shares is at first to be negotiated with the  
                transferor.   It   is   only   in   the   case   of   a   default   in   such  





                agreement being reached that the company's Auditors step in  
                and fix a "fair price". The third distinctive feature of these  
                two categories is that upon refusal/default of the preemptor,  
                the transferor is required to give a notice in writing of his  
                desire to transfer. Giving of this notice must necessarily be  
                subsequent   to   the   failure   of   ', Article   57-A',    for   whatever  
                reason, as the Directors are required to find a willing person  
                either in the 2nd and if not the 3rd category within a period

',                 Therefore unless the transferor gives a separate notice of the  
                failure of ', Article 57-A',  how would a willing member know

                intimating   their   willingness   to   purchase   was   to   lapse?  
                Article   also   requires   the   Directors   to   give   a   notice   to   the  
                transferor   after   finding   a   willing   purchasing   member   or  




                                                                 
                selected   under   Article   Giving   of   this   notice   is   important  
                because   if   30   days   expires   without   such   notice   by   the  
                Directors, Article would come into play and the transferor  
                would be at liberty to sell the shares to any person and at  




                                                   
                any price, albeit also within a period of 30 days from the  
                expiry of the first period of 30 days. It follows that a notice  
                                   
                issued prior to the preemptor exercising or failing to exercise  
                the right under ', Article 57-A',  would not be in keeping with  
                                  
                Articles and 60 as this would make the period of 30 days  
                uncertain if not illusory. Thus the notice by the transferor  
                under Article must succeed the factual failure of ', Article 57-A',   
                and notice, if any, under Article must follow the failure of  
        

                Article.

                there is no time limit fixed either for the parties to arrive at  
                a negotiated price or for the Auditor to fix a fair value. But  





                Article   indicates   that   the   entire   transaction   envisaged   by

',     It can be seen from the above that the Apex Court categorized the 
    seller and buyer of the shares and applied a different yardstick. The

    by the transferor.  As regards the decision by the Malaysian Court in 
    the case of  Lo Mu Sen (supra), once there is a decision of the Apex 




                                                
    Court interpreting similar Articles holds the field, it is not necessary 
                                   
    to refer to the same.  Mr.De'Vitre has relied upon the decision in the

    otherwise   as   it   is   rightly   pointed   out   by   Mr.De'Vitre   in   the   case 
    before the Malaysian Court, the Company was a family Company 
        


    and the founder of the Company, father had wished that shares will 
     



    be held by the children in a particular proportion and it is in that 
    background that the factum of transfer was considered.

    scheme as is sought to be interpreted applies, whether this MOU 
    constituted   a   transfer   notice   and   the   agency.     According   to 





    Mr.Dwarkadas there is no particular format provided for a transfer 
    notice.  He submitted that all that is required is the intention.  Once 
    there   is   a   desire   to   transfer   the   shares,   it   will   constitute   the 
    Company   as   its   agent.     It   is   also   contended   that   the   agency   is 
    created by the Articles and not by a transfer notice  per se.  It was

    notice   of   transfer.     Mr.Dwarkadas   submitted   that   any   document

    transfer notice.  Reliance was placed on the decision of the English

    no specific need to address any separate notice to the Company.  It 
                                   
    was submitted that Laloum was fully aware that Muthu was the 
    Managing director  of the Company and the signing of the MOU in 
                                  
    the circumstances constituted sufficient notice.

',     100.     The Board rejected the contentions of Muthu group on the 
        


    ground that the ', Article 15',  and the other modalities did not apply.  I 
     



    am in agreement with the view taken by the Company Law Board 
    that the scheme as propounded by Muthu group did not apply to 
    member-to-member transfer.  However, for sake of completeness, I 





    will consider the alternate position that even assuming the articles 
    as contended apply, whether MOU could be treated as a transfer 
    notice.

                not constitute the Directors as the transferor's agents for the

                persons if any. There was also no question of the transferor  
                                  
                invoking Article bypassing the right of a willing member or

    The above-emphasized portion would show that unless a specific 
    notice is issued, there was no question of any agency being created. 
',      



',     The   Apex   Court   also   held  that   the   directors  must   be  specifically 
    constituted   as   an   agent.     Thus,   Apex   Court   laid   down   that   the 





    transfer notice itself must make the directors the agents.

    unambiguous notice will curtail future litigation such as the present 
    one. The MOU is not even a letter.  It is at the most an agreement

    absurd to suggest that since Muthu is a managing director, even

    though   what   Muthu   signed   was   regarding   his   shareholding,   will 




                                                                                     
    constitute a notice to the Company.  Further MOU does not state a 
    word   of   expressly   authorising   the   Company   as   an   agent.     Such

    notice, but also the fact that the MOU was being treated as notice 
    and was placed before the Board of directors, was not informed to 
    Nafan and Lesaffre.  The case of Lyle & Scott Ltd. (supra) did not 




                                               
    arise from the case of oppression and mismanagement but arose 
                                   
    from civil suit for specific performance based on the pre-emptory 
    clauses.   Furthermore,   as   has   been   rightly   pointed   out   by 
                                  
    Mr.De'Vitre, the concerned articles in that case only envisaged an 
    intention   to   transfer   and   did   not   provide   for   a   formal   notice. 
    Furthermore, the action of treating the MOU as a transfer notice in 
        


    the present case is not to be considered as an isolated incident but 
     



    in   the   larger   scheme   of   things.     In   the   case   of    Re   Ringtower  
    Holdings   (supra) the Court concluded that there was no intention 
    to sell the shares in the facts of the case.     Merely because some 





    observations  can  be   used to support the  submission, a judgment 
    cannot be read de hors the factual backdrop.  Reliance on the case 
    of  Mannai   Investments   Co.   Vs.   Eagle   Star   Life   Assurance   Co.

    only illegal and contrary to the articles on the part of Muthu group 
    but in the factual backdrop, it was highly inequitable.   Therefore, 




                                                          
    not only the Board meetings that were held without Board's notice 
    were illegal and oppressive but also the action of using MOU as a 




                                                         
    transfer notice.  It was argued that Muthu group acted based on the 
    opinion   of   a   senior   Advocate   and   therefore   their   action   was 
    bonafide.   The opinion of the senior advocate refers to ", Article 16', , 




                                              
    which according to Mr.Dwarkadas, does not apply.  It was agreed by 
                                   
    the counsel that it will be proper not to debate on the merits of the 
    opinion but to restrict  the debate only to bonafides.   The senior 
                                  
    advocate   did   not   opine   that   Muthu   group   could   proceed   in   the 
    manner as they have done.   Question here is the lack of probity. 
    Muthu   is   an   experienced  business.    He   fully   knew  what  he   was 
        


    doing.     The   opinion   is   only   used   as   crutches   to   support   an 
     



    otherwise oppressive act.

    pushed   through   and   the   manner   in   which   the   duplicate   share

    design to usurp the shareholding of Nafan.  Mr.Dwarkadas tried his 
    level best to justify the act as of Muthu group.  Most of the events 




                                                             
    narrated   by   Mr.Dwarkadas   are   nothing   but   internal   discussions 
    amongst the Muthu group starting from 16 March 2009 till 25 May 
    2009.     The   argument   that   the   agency   created   in   favour   of   the 




                                                
    Company and the MOU itself impliedly gave the power to grant of 
                                   
    duplicate   share   certificates,   is   sought   to   be   raised   with   no 
    foundation in law.   Language of ', Section 84',  clearly speaks to the 
                                  
    contrary for any such implication. It was also submitted that the 
    case in Shoe Specialties (supra)  is distinguishable on facts.  It was 
    also   contended   that   not   every   conduct   need   be   considered   as 
        


    oppressive.  I am not impressed by any of these submissions.  The 
     



    conduct of issuance of duplicate certificates was clearly a part of a 
    design to remove Nafan and Lesaffre from the Company.  Once it is 
    held that meetings itself were illegal, the MOU did not constitute 





    the transfer notice, then get duplicate share certificates in absence 
    of  any written  authority only compounds the  acts of oppression. 
    What is sought to be done is that each act is sought to be justified 





    in   isolation,   but   what   needs   to   be   considered   is   totality   of   the 
    actions  leading  to  acts of oppression.   The  issuance  of duplicate 
    share certificates in this manner surely constituted one piece in the 
    large   scheme   of   their.     I   am   therefore,   in   agreement   with   the 
    Company Law Board in respect of the finding rendered by it on this

    Sharp   &   Tannan   has   deliberately   used   guidelines,   which   are 
    inapplicable.  The Board has concluded that the valuation report is

    the   observations   and   declarations   made   by   the   Board   that   the 
    report is biased, partial and in contravention of statutory guidelines 
    and rules to carry out valuation of shares of going concern.  It is the 
        


    contention of Nafan and Lesaffre that the valuation was done at the 
     



    instance of Muthu group, it was deliberately kept on the lower side 
    and prepared in short time span to meet the requirements of Muthu 





    group,   and   thus   in   collusion.     It   was   contended   that   right   from 
    inception, Muthu knew that he would be able to get valuation from 
    Sharp & Tannan as per his requirement.

    impartiality and unreliability, cannot follow.   Nafan has produced 
    no   proof   in   support   of   allegations   of   collusion   and   fraud.     He

    valuation are never adverted to.  Merely because the RBI circular of 
    2010   mentions   Discounted   Cash   Flow   method   (DCF),   does   not 
                                  
    mean   that   is  the   only  method.    Mr.Subramaniam submitted that 
    there is nothing wrong in preparing a report within 24 hours and it 
    is easily possible when all the data is available on the computer.  He 
           


    reiterated   that   method   of   valuation   under   CCI   guidelines   is 
        



    legitimate method of valuation.  He relied on RBI Circular No.7 of 
    2008/2009   dated   1   July   2008   referring   to   CCI   guidelines.     He 
    submitted   that   the   Apex   Court   in   the   case   of  Hindustan   Lever 





    Employee's   Union   Vs.Hindustan   Lever   Ltd.40  and  Miheer 
    H.Mafatlal  Vs.Mafatlal  Industries Ltd.41  has laid down that  the 
    valuers   are   experts   in   their   field   and   Court   should   be   slow   in 





    substituting   their   findings.     Merely   because   an   expert   adopts   a 
    particular method of valuation in one case and the same method 
    not adopted in another case does not render the valuation bad. As 
    regards   the   contentions   about   suppression   in   the   pleadings, 
    Mr.Subramaniam supported the contentions of Mr.Dwarkadas.

    submitted that ', article 17',  was referred to in the MOU and parties 
    agreed to abide by the valuation of the statutory auditor.  Nafan did 
    not insist upon any valuation method in spite of having received 




                                              
    the MOU some time in February 2009.   He contended that if the 
                                   
    price of shares between 1992 and 2009 is concerned, it has grown 
    from   `237 per share to   `4315 per share. The same valuer had 
                                  
    carried out the valuation earlier.  In the year 1998, when Lesaffre 
    sold   its   shareholding   to   Nafan   the   shares   were   sold   at   `  1070. 
    Therefore,   since   1998   there   has   been   400   per   cent   increase   in 
           


    shares.  He submitted that unless the valuation is vitiated by fraud 
        



    or fundamental mistake the same could not be challenged.   The

    challenged  to  show  the  oppressive  acts of Muthu  group  and the 
    Board has rightly held that the way the valuation was carried out is 
                                  
    oppressive.     He   submitted   that   even   assuming   the   MOU   is 
    executable it contemplates fair valuation.  The valuation carried out 
    is not only not fair but no valuation in eyes of law. He submitted 
        


    that   the   valuation   does   not   take   into   account   the   well-settled 
     



    methods of valuation.   He submitted that the methods, which are 
    generally adopted and mandated, have not been carried out by the 
    valuer.   He submitted that CCI method is completely inapplicable 





    and in violation of the RBI instructions.   The valuation is absurd,

    substantial turnover. Even assuming the case of Muthu that it was 
    contemplated   that   majority   shareholders   would   exit   upon 
    valuation; fair valuation was to be done by statutory auditor.  M/s 
        


    Sharp and Tannan have been the auditors of the Company for a 
     



    long time. With such a major decision being left to them, it was 
    their duty to be fair to both Muthu group, and Nafan and Lesaffre. 
    They would be fully aware what they were determining was the 





    price of exit of Nafan from the Company.   This is not to say in a 
    routine valuation, care need not be taken, in the present case but 
    M/s Sharp and Tannan were fully aware of the implications of their 





    valuation,  having been associated with the SAF Yeast for several 
    years. The manner in which the valuation was done in 24 hours, 
    when   there   was   apparently   no   need   for   such   urgency   without 
    following well known methods which has given rise to charge of 
    oppression by the Nafan and Lesaffre. Therefore, the entire issue of 
    valuation has to be viewed in that perspective. There is no doubt,

    well-established  principles of valuation  at all from consideration.

                referred   to   the   following   valuation   techniques   which   are

                (DCF).  The chartered accountants have then discussed the  
     



                merits   and   demerits   of   the   different   techniques   and  
                thereafter suggested that since the DCF method captures all  
                the elements of the value of a business compared to the other  
                methods,   the   DCF   method   comprehends   the   difference  





                between   the   values   of   firms   having   similar   accounting 
                earnings   due   to   the   difference   in   capital   investments   and  
                other   cash   flows   required   to   sustain   these   earnings.   By  
                adopting the said technique, the chartered accountants have  





                worked   out   the   fair   value   per   share   of   Alembic   Ltd.   and

                The chartered accountants have, therefore, suggested that on

                fair and reasonable, a share exchange ratio of one equity

    not referred to DCF method at all.  An explanation is sought to be 
    given that the valuation had to be done  in a hurry in view of the

    that the valuation is carried out for the purpose of Circular of the 
    year 2004.  There is no gain saying that the valuation conformed to 




                                                           
    the parameters laid down in the RBI Circular of 2004, when the 
    Circular was not for fair value but for completely different reasons. 
    In fact, the Circular dated 4 May 2010-RBI has emphasized for DCF

    Mr.Subramanian   that   the   valuation   conformed   with   Circular   of 
    2004   indicate   the   way   Muthu   group   and   Sharp   &   Tannan   have 
    acted.  Reliance is placed on valuation methods, which are not for 
        


    fair valuation is required for completely different purpose under the 
     



    RBI guidelines.  The entire attempt is not to put forth the fair value 
    of shares.  M/s Sharp and Tannan based its valuation report on Net 
    Asset Value and profit earning capacity value.  Even these methods 





    do not comply with RBI circular of 2004.   Reliance of the letter 
    dated   19   February   2009   is   misplaced.     This   letter   from   Reserve 
    Bank of India is a routine letter which only directs that Company to 





    carry out transactions in terms of the circular. It is far-fetched to 
    suggest   that   the   RBI   itself   applied   its   mind   and   approved   the 
    valuation carried out treating it as a fair valuation.

    pointed out by Mr.De'Vitre that the report of the year 1992 was for 
    the   purpose   of   an   application  to  the  Controller of  Capital  Issues 




                                                            
    seeking its prior approval to price of new shares.  It did not require 
    valuation of the Company as a going concern.   No capital can be 




                                                           
    made therefore, on the ground that 1992 valuation was based on 
    CCI method.  The contention that NAV method was rightly followed 
    cannot be accepted as the VIRC reference manual which explains 




                                               
    the   NAV   method   shows   that   it   is   to   be   adopted   in   case   of 
                                   
    manufacturing   companies   where   fixed   assets   have   greater 
    relevance for earning revenues. Nothing is shown as to how this is 
                                  
    so and the Board therefore, has correctly rejected this contention.

    these guidelines have not been followed.  Para 7.3 of CCI guidelines 
    have been relied upon.  I have seen the guidelines.  The guidelines 





    state   that   though   past   profits   would   serve   as   indicator,   future 
    should   not   be   completely   ignored.   In   spite   of   this   position,   the 
    valuation is based on the earlier years and there is no projection for 





    future.  Even the time taken for assessing the average earning, the 
    years  in  which  there  is an  unusual variance  has to be  excluded. 
    The   year   2005   should   have   been   excluded   as   in   that   year   the 
    earning   was  `82,36,045   in   comparison   with   2004   where   it   was

    carried out the valuation; the Court will uphold the valuation.  This 
    argument   is   difficult   to   accept.     What   the   MOU   stated   was   the 
    parties   would   part   ways   on   fair   value   and   not   upon   valuation, 
        


    which is not fair. Can it be said that even if the valuation is arrived 
     



    at ignoring  well-established methods and it is at    `1, still Nafan 
    must accept the same since it agreed that a statutory auditor would 
    carry out the valuation. The proposition cannot be stretched to an 





    absurd limit.  Because a party agrees to a valuation by the statutory 
    auditor   it   does   not   mean   it   relinquish   all   the   rights.   Various

                respondents to the maintainability of the challenge mounted  
                by the petitioner to the valuation report. Mr. P.C. Khanna,  
                learned   senior   counsel   appearing   on   behalf   of   the  
                respondents, submitted that the valuer's report was binding

                While   computing   the   stake/share   of   the   petitioner   in   the  
                company the valuer acted as an expert and not as a quasi  
                arbitrator or an arbitrator. This being so his report cannot  




                                                  
                be attacked in the instant proceedings. The valuation given  
                by the valuer is final and conclusive between the parties. In  
                                   
                case the petitioner is aggrieved of the valuation determined  
                by the valuer, his remedy lies in filing a suit for damages  
                against   the   valuer   for   negligence.   Mr.   Khanna   canvassed  
                                  
                that   initially   the   view   of   the   English   courts   was   that   no  
                action   lay   against   the   experts   such   as   valuers,   auditors,  
                brokers   etc   in   tort   for   giving   an   opinion   or   making   a  
        

                determination negligently. This was on the ground that they  
                were   discharging   professional   duties   of   quasi   judicial  
     



                character.   Since   the   experts   could   not   be   sued,   their  
                determination could be impugned in the litigation between  
                the   parties   affected   by   their   determination   or   opinion.  
                Learned counsel further argued that the aforesaid principle  





                has  been  discarded in England and the position, as made  
                clear by the House of Lords, is that an expert can be sued for  
                damages   when   he   acts   negligently   in   performance   of   his  
                duties. In support of his submissions, Mr.Khanna relied on

',                 "Be that as it may, the position in law seems to be that a  
                valuer   cannot   claim   immunity   any   more   if   he   acts  
                negligently in making his determination and can be sued for  





                tort or negligence but action against the valuer for damages  
                cannot come in the way when the court is considering the  
                validity of the valuation itself. The fact that the parties may  
                have agreed that the valuation arrived at by a valuer would  
                be binding on them, the agreement does not imply that they  
                will be bound even by a valuation which is erroneous. In this  
                country   the   courts   cannot   be   bound   to   accept   the

                Khanna   contended   that   the   compromise   recorded   by   the  
                court   constitutes   a   decree   and   if   this   is   so   the   valuation  




                                                                                         
                arrived   at   by   the   valuer   cannot   be   challenged   in   these

                the learned  senior counsel. While it may be true that the  
                compromise recorded by the court constitutes a decree but  
                that does not mean that the report of the valuer which was  
                directed to be filed under the order of this court cannot be  




                                                                
                touched in these proceedings. In case the report suffers from  
                mistake or perversity, the same can certainly be set aside in  
                these proceedings and the matter can be referred for fresh  
                valuation by an expert. The court is not bound to accept the  




                                                  
                report  in  case  the same is erroneous. Mr. Sanghi, learned  
                counsel   for   the   petitioner,   claimed   that   M/s   Coopers   &

                the   valuation.   On   the   other   hand,   Mr.   Khanna,   learned  
                senior counsel for the respondents, refuted this position and  
                submitted that the appointment of the valuer was made by  
                by   this   court   order   on   the   basis   of   the   terms   of   the  
        

                compromise arrived at between the parties and the same was  
                not made under Order 26 Rule 9 C.P.C. It is not necessary to  
     



                examine   the   submissions   of   the   learned   counsel   for   the  
                parties in view of the aforesaid determination."

    Delhi   High   Court   has   concluded   that   not   all   the   principles   laid 
    down in the decisions of the English Court reflect the legal position 
    prevalent in India.   It held that an expert opinion does not enjoy 





    absolute   immunity   even   if   it   suffers   from   fundamental   mistake, 
    collusion, and fraud.   I respectfully agree with this view.   Even in 
    the cases relied upon by Mr.Dwarkadas, and which were considered 
    by the Delhi High Court, the Courts have kept the rider that the 
    valuers report does not enjoy absolute immunity.   In the present

                power is exercised by another. The authority concerned does  
                not apply its mind and take action on its own judgment,

    reports   have   been   prepared   in   short   time.     It   is   correct   that 
                                   
    technology   and   faster   processing   of   information   will   expedite 
    preparation of reports.   However, whether a valuer should produce 
                                  
    report in 24 hours, whether technology permits it to do so will have 
    to be assessed on facts of each case.   In the present case, there was 
    absolutely no need to prepare report in a hurry and to omit the 
        


    most relevant method.   Nafan has placed on record that they had 
     



    obtained   a   valuation   report   from   another   reputed   valuer,   which 
    shows the same shares as valued substantially higher.  According to 
    them, the correct valuation was about 25 million Euros at that time 





    while Sharp & Tannan valued the shareholding at approximately 27 
    crores only.  Thus, price of a majority stake in one of leading yeast 
    manufacturing company in India is valued at 27 crores.  It cannot 





    be helped but observing that is the cost of two, three residential 
    flats   in   upmarket   Mumbai.     Not   that   on   that   ground   alone   the 
    valuation   of   M/s   Sharp   and   Tannan   is   bad,   but   this   valuation 
    carried   out   by   another   reputed   valuer   is   not   an   irrelevant 
    circumstance, when it is coupled with other circumstances.  Nafan's

    report was prepared and used by Muthu group, the finding of the 




                                               
    board that this conduct of the Muthu group is a part of oppressive 
                                   
    conduct,   cannot be termed as a perverse finding.         Considering 
    the facts on record as analyzed earlier, one is surely left with an 
                                  
    impression   that   something   was   seriously   amiss   the   way     the 
    valuation report was presented.  Had it been a stand-alone instance 
    of a mere valuation report presented for discussions, it would have 
        


    been a different matter.   The preparation of such valuation report 
     



    was a piece of much large picture and it fitted in the scheme of 
    things   perpetuated   by   Mr.Muthu.     The   preparation   of   such 
    valuation   report   through   M/s   Sharp   and   Tannan   completed   the 





    scheme of usurping the shares of Nafan.

    circumstances of the case, to discard the valuation report and make 
    the   observations  it   made.     M/s   Sharp   and   Tannan,   knowing  the 
    responsibility casts upon them and the consequences thereof, ought 
    to have been more careful and ought not to have prepared a report 
    on the basis completely different than the acceptable norms.   The 
    total   lack   of   explanation   as   to   why     there   was   need   to   prepare

    though   it   has   held   that   Nafan   succeeded   in   proving   the   case   of 
    oppression, concluded that the ultimate relief should be that Nafan

    concluded that two groups could not run the Company together as 
     



    the relations between the parties have become acrimonious.   The 
    Board   opined   that   the   permanent   solution   in   the   paramount 





    interest of SAF Yeast is sale of shares of one group to another.  The 
    Board thereafter considered the claim of both the parties as who 
    should buy out whom.  According to Nafan and Lesaffre, they are a 





    leading   business   group   worldwide   in   the   yeast   business.     They 
    supplied financial and technical support to SAF Yeast and they have 
    substantially contributed to its growth.   They also contended that 
    the title 'SAF Yeast' is derived from the word 'Lesaffre'.  A grievance 
    was   made   that   Muthu   group   caused   SAF   Yeast   to   file   criminal 
    complaints,   which   were   subsequently   withdrawn.   On   behalf   of

    would not get into the contentions of either parties regarding their 
    respective contribution, as it was a joint venture.   The Board held 
        


    that   the   joint   venture   was   for   commercial   purpose.   Lesaffre   and 
     



    SAF  Yeast  have   already received back their money with interest. 
    Nafan   and   Lesaffre   are   based   in   Netherlands   and   France 
    respectively and it is necessary that Indians are involved in running 





    the Company since it is in interior places in India, and the policy of 
    Indian  government  relating to foreign  investment  may not  allow 
    Nafan to acquire 100 per cent shareholding. It was held that Muthu 





    group   has   given   personal   guarantees.     The   action   taken   in   the 
    meetings was on legal advice and it was bonafide meeting, which 
    had to be hurriedly called in view of the meeting to be held in Paris

    severely reprimand any one.  Thereafter the Board directed buyout

    the Indians run the Company.  Government may not allow Lesaffre 
    and Nafan to acquire 100 per cent shareholding.  Muthu group has 
    given guarantees.   Muthu has vast experience in the business and

    meetings   were   taken   on   apprehension   and   legal   advice.     One

    Muthu group is directed to exit, they will have no other source of 
    livelihood.  If Lesaffre and Nafan are directed to exit, they will not

    held  that  two  groups  cannot  go together and parting of ways  is 





    imminent.   The   Board   has   also   rightly   discarded   the   rival 
    contentions of regarding contributions. SAF Yeast is a joint venture. 
    It   was   created   together.     Nafan   and   Lesaffre   held   51   per   cent 





    shareholding   and   Muthu   group   49   per   cent.     Nothing   stopped 
    Muthu group from establishing the Company on its own, yet the 
    Company was started as a joint venture. Nothing stopped Muthu 
    from establishing a unit on the technology stated to be available 
    with him, yet joint venture was formulated with Lesaffre who are 
    already in the business of manufacturing of yeast.  It was a mutual

    agreement and no party was coerced or forced to set up a joint 




                                                                                     
    venture.   Obviously   therefore,   it   was   set   up   for   mutual   benefit. 
    Nafan   and   Lesaffre   had   placed   on   record   their   stand   that   they 




                                                            
    wanted to set up a unit for manufacturing of yeast in India as they 
    saw potential in the market and in view of restrictions placed by 




                                                           
    the   Indian   government   they   had   to   start   it   in   a   joint   venture. 
    Therefore,   once     joint   venture   had   been   set   up   the   aspect   of 
    contribution does not assume so much of importance as rightly held 




                                               
    by the Board.  The Board however proceeded to hold that Lesaffre 
                                   
    and Nafan had already received their money back with interest as 
    against their investment in the form of shareholding.  I do not find 
                                  
    this approach to be correct. Lesaffre and Nafan are not investors. 
    They   were   51   per   cent   majority   shareholders   of   the   Company. 
    Thus, they were owners of the Company and not investors.   They 
        


    had   equal   interest   in   continuing  the   Company   and   it   was   not   a 
     



    mere loan transaction.  These also not mere finances but experts in 
    the production of yeast.

    oppression   rendered   against   Muthu   group   is   set     aside   and   the 
    appeal   of   Nafan   and   Lesaffre   are   dismissed,   then   the   order   to 





    buyout   under   ', Section   402',    cannot   be   disturbed.     He   has   further 
    contended that the entire case of Nafan and Lesaffre is that they 
    should be permitted to buyout because they are injured party and 
    majority shareholders.   He relied on the decision of the Calcutta 
    High   Court   in  ', Bajrang   Prasad   Jalan   v.   Mahabir   Jalan',  49    to

    contend that the main consideration is what course of action would 




                                                                                   
    be for the benefit of the Company.  He submitted that in the case of 
    Probir Kumar Misra  (supra), the Madras High Court had clearly 




                                                          
    relied   upon   underlying   intention   in   an   agreement   to   order   a 
    buyout.   He submitted that in any case, without prejudice, Muthu 




                                                         
    group is willing to put an end to the litigation by having the shares 
    valued   by   an   independent   expert   and   thereby   completing   the 
    buyout process.  Therefore, the primary stand of the Muthu group 




                                              
    is that since there is no oppression by them there is no question of 
                                   
    any buyout of their shares and without prejudice, they are willing 
    to buyout the shares at the valuation fixed by this Court.

',     132.      I have already concluded that the findings of the Board 
    regarding   oppression   by   Muthu   group   are   correct.   Therefore, 
        


    question is regarding the validity of the direction to order buyout in 
     



    favour of Muthu group even if they committed act of oppression. In 
    earlier paragraph, I have mentioned the grounds on which Board 
    has   ordered   buyout   of   the   shares   of   Nafan   and   Lesaffre.     The 





    grounds given by the Board as to why there should be a buyout of 
    the shares of Nafan and Lesaffre are on the face of it, erroneous. 
    The Board has stated that Muthu and his family will have no source 





    of livelihood.  The manner and  the level at which the litigation is 
    fought in the Board as well as in this Court and it will be nave to 
    assume that the family will be on streets.   Furthermore, if a buyout 
    is ordered, it is not that Muthu group will be thrown out on the 
    streets without any money. The buyout will be of the value of their

    shareholding, which will be substantial, and Muthu group will be 




                                                                                        
    free to carry on their business activities elsewhere or can always 
    invest it.   Even Mr.Dwarkadas has not contended that Muthu and 




                                                                
    his   family   will   be   on   the   streets.       The   next   reason   is   that   no 
    prejudice will be caused to Nafan and Lesaffre if they are directed 




                                                               
    exit because they are running various other companies worldwide. 
    If SAF Yeast was a joint venture in the area in which Nafan and 
    Lesaffre have expertise, they cannot be ordered to be exited from 




                                                 
    SAF   Yeast   simply   because   they   have   other   companies   in   other 
                                   
    developing countries.  In fact, it would strengthen the case of Nafan 
    and Lesaffre that they should be allowed to run the Company since 
                                  
    they have expertise and experience in running various companies in 
    other   developing   countries.    Then   the   Board   has  brought   in   the 
    intention of Nafan and Lesaffre while executing the MOU to order 
        


    the   buyout,   which   aspect   I   have   already   dealt   with.     Equally 
     



    untenable is the ground that since Nafan and Lesaffre are based in 
    Europe, it is better that an Indian runs the Company.   The joint 
    ventures between Indian entities with a foreign one now common. 
', 




',     Even though Nafan and Lesaffre are based outside India, they can 
    always have local nominee directors and such other staff who are 
    based in India. If buyout is to be ordered on this ground then most 





    of the joint ventures in India will be in serious peril.

    ordered to exit, the Company will lose its name, which will result in 




                                               
    substantial loss of goodwill for SAF Yeast.   I find that in spite of 
                                   
    making the submission before the Board regarding loss of good will 
    by loss of name 'SAF', at the time of ordering buyout, the Board has 
                                  
    not referred to it at all.  In the Participation Agreement of the year 
    1991, the parties have agreed that SAF Yeast will use the term 'SAF' 
    only  with  the   consent   of Lesaffre  and Nafan and if the  share of 
        


    Nafan and Lesaffre drop below a particular limit,   the word 'SAF' 
     



    will be deleted.  It is the contention of Muthu group that the phrase 
    'SAF' is not derived from Lesaffre but from a Hindi term and it is 
    not much of importance.   However, the clause in the Participation 





    Agreement   cannot   be   ignored.     The   Board   has   also   noted   that 
    Lesaffre is a world leader in manufacturing of yeast.  Phonetically 
    SAF   does  seem  to   have  been  derived from Lesaffre.    The  name, 





    which indicates that SAF Yeast is a part of one of the world leaders 
    in the yeast business, will be no doubt create substantial goodwill.

    emphasized is that since Muthu has vast experience in the field of

    should be allowed to buy out the Nafan and Lesaffre.  However, this 




                                                           
    finding is contrary to the Board's own finding earlier that it is not 
    inclined   to   accept   contentions   of   either   parties   regarding   their 
    contribution as they had entered into joint venture for commercial 




                                              
    purpose.  The Board has then gone on to hold that in case Nafan is 
                                   
    allowed to  take  over the management, it may not be  capable of 
    handling the situation.  This is a rather simplistic view of the way 
                                  
    large scale industrial operations are run.   Merely because if Nafan 
    takes over the control, does not mean that it will terminate all the 
    existing   staff.     Professionals   manage   the   business   nowadays.

    Nafan  and  Lesaffre   cannot    carry out affairs of the  Company by 





    employing competent professionals.   To my mind all the grounds

                 such resolution, Dr. Binod Prasad Sinha, the appellant No. 2  
                 was ousted from the directorship under ', Section  283(1)(g)',  of

                 that his brother was likely to attend the meeting to be held  
                 on   16.2.1996.   But   suddenly   the   meeting   was   held   on  
                                   
                 7.2.1996 and the appellant No. 1 was stripped off his chair  
                 as   the   Managing   Director   of   the   company.   Hence,   Sajal  
                                  
                 Dutta became the Managing Director in place of Dr. Kamal  
                 Kumar   Dutta   and   the   minutes   of   the   said   meeting   dated  
                 7.2.1996   were   not   brought   forward   in   the   meeting   of  
                 16.2.1996 in which Dr. K.K. Dutta was present. The IDBI  
        

                 nominee reported to have advised that the draft minutes of  
                 the meeting dated 7.2.1996 to be placed before the meeting  
     



                 dated 16.2.1996 which would correctly reflect Sajal Dutta  
                 as   the   Managing   Director   but   it   was   not   included   in   the  
                 meeting   of   16.2.1996.   However,   Mr.   Nariman   tried   to  
                 persuade us to show that there was some defect in drafting  





                 of   minutes   of   the   resolution   and   therefore,   it   was   not  
                 reflected in the meeting dated 16.2.1996. It does not appeal  
                 to us.  Be that as it may, when such an important decision  
                 was   taken   in   the   absence   of   the   main   promoter   of   the  





                 company to oust him from the Managing Directorship and

                 of the shares were cornered by the subsidiary companies of

    issued and shares were transferred at the valuation, which was not

    aberration but a clear calculated act of grossest oppression.  It may 
                                   
    be that in the past notices were not given but never before stage of 
    exit in the company had arisen.  It was the most important decision 
                                  
    to be taken in the entire existence of the company.   After having 
    successfully gone through the plan of usurping the share holding of 
    a majority group, detailed justifications advanced to cover up the 
        


    conduct, which on the face of it, lacks in fairness. Taking law in 
     



    own hands cannot be termed as a normal human behaviour, as the 
    Board   has   observed.     If   this   is   tolerated,   it   will   create   serious 
    uncertainties for joint ventures and leads to complete lawlessness, 





    as   one   group   will   simply   transfer   share   holding   of   others   to 
    themselves without notice.

                admission of the petition against such a company. If so then  
                why   the   Petitioner   be   kept   away   from   this  right,  its  only  
                fault being that it lent the monies outside India and filed a  
                suit   for   recovery   of   the   same   in   the   Court   where   the  





                transaction   took   place.   To   deprive   the   Petitioner   will  
                encourage   Indian   companies   to   be   dishonest   in   their  
                international   dealings.  With   globalization   of   trade   and  
                investments, cross border flow of capital and the dependence  
                of   the   country's   economy   on   international   commerce,   the  
                company court needs to be alive to the changing commercial

    to buy-out the shares of Muthu Group.  On behalf of Muthu Group, 




                                                               
    it   is   contended   that   their   civil   suit   is   pending   and   if   buyout   is 
    ordered in favour of Nafan now, then it would become 100 percent 
    shareholder of SAF Yeast. If later the suit is decreed in favour of 




                                                 
    Muthu   Group,   then   Muthu   Group   will   become   51   percent 
                                   
    shareholder and Nafan will be come 49 percent shareholder, which 
    is impracticable.   It was also contended that by this methodology 
                                  
    the   MOU   would   be   kept   aside.     I   am   not   impressed   by   these 
    submissions on behalf of Muthu Group. If the meetings were held 
    in legal, proper, and fair manner, Nafan and Lesaffre would have 
        


    put-forth  their  stand  on MOU that  they were  not ready.   Muthu 
     



    Group would in normal circumstances would have filed a civil suit 
    to   enforce   the   MOU.   Muthu   Group   would   have   sought   an 





    injunction against Nafan not to transfer the shareholding to anyone 
    else.  When Muthu Group apprehended coercive action on the part 
    of Nafan, they could had invoked jurisdiction of the Board and the 
    Board would have issued appropriate direction if case was made 





    out. The Muthu group did not take any such steps expected of a 
    law-abiding citizen.

    agreement is discretionary.  Therefore, the right in favour of Muthu

',     146.   There is however one more aspect. I must also keep in mind 
    the interest of SAF Yeast.  If future uncertainties are avoided it will 




                                                 
    be good for SAF yeast. If future of SAF Yeast can be made litigation 
    free, then I will explore that option first. That option I will rank 
                                   
    higher that the right of Nafan for buyout at present. However, if 
                                  
    that is not being secured then right in favour of Nafan will have to 
    given effect to. I say so because after buyout is granted in favour of 
    Nafan,  litigation  will not end as the  will suit go on.   Nafan  has 
        


    shown that it is not averse to a competitive bid, though it is their 
     



    alternate submission. Therefore, if Muthu group withdraws the civil 
    suit and undertakes not to rely on the MOU, then the litigation can 
    be   put   an   end   to   by   a   bid.   Then   if   a   competitive   bid   is   held, 





    litigation   free   future   can   be   secured   for   SAF   yeast.   However,   if 
    Muthu group is not ready and this object is not being achieved then 
    buyout in favour of Nafan will have to follow.   I am, therefore, of 





    the   opinion   that,   before   ordering   a   buy-out   in   favour   of   Nafan, 
    possibility   of   a   forward   competitive   bid   be   explored.     That   way, 
    both the parties will make a competitive bid and one who will sell 
    out, will get a fair value.   It will also put an end to the litigation 
    once for all and a single group can then manage the company.  It 
    will   be   in   benefit   of   Nafan   also   as   the   bidding   will   take   place

    on the undertaking of the Muthu group. Otherwise, I have already

    could thus be in two steps. Part I will be  the forward competitive 
    bid for which Muthu Group will have to withdraw the civil suit they 
                                   
    have filed and not take any steps based on MOU henceforth and

    is   not   shown   in   the   stipulated   period,   then   Part   II   of   the   order 
    regarding buy-out will come into effect.

    has handed over a broad outline as regards the procedure to be 
    adopted for both the options.   Having found the modalities to be

',     149.     The  conclusion   in  short   is  as  follows.  The   appeal  filed  by 




                                                              
    Lesaffre is maintainable. The petition filed by Nafan was rightly not 
    dismissed by the Board on the ground of suppression of facts. The 




                                                 
    declaration  given by the Board that MOU is valid, effective, and 
    enforceable   document   and   its   terms   are   binding,   cannot   be 
                                   
    sustained as it is beyond the jurisdiction of the Board, and needs to 
                                  
    be   agitated   in   the   suit,   which   is   pending.  Prima   facie,  no 
    unquestionable   intention   can   be   culled   out   from   the   MOU.   The 
    Board meetings held on 29 January 2009, 23 May 2009, and 25 
        


    May 2009 and the resolutions passed therein, are invalid, illegal, 
     



    and oppressive, so also the issuance of duplicate share certificates. 
    The   Board   has   rightly   discarded   the   valuation   report   and   the 
    reliance upon the same by Muthu Group is an act of oppression. 
', 




',     The comments made by the Board on the valuation report, were 
    justified.   The   direction   of   the   Board   to   Muthu   Group   to   rectify 
    register of SAF Yeast by restoring the shareholding of Nafan and 





    Lesaffre is valid and proper. The direction given by the Board to 
    Nafan and Lesaffre to transfer their shareholding to Muthu Group is 
    not   sustainable   and   has   to   be   set   aside.   Nafan   is   entitled   to   a 
    buyout   as   prayed   for   in   its   petition.   However,   it   will   be   in   the 
    interest of SAF yeast that the litigation ends and if Muthu group

    proceedings based on the MOU then the dispute can be put an end 
    to   by   holding  a  forward  competitive   bid.  If  Muthu  Group  is not

    overseeing   the   two   options,   as   suggested   by   the   Board,   Justice 




                                                         
    J.N.Patel is appointed as an Administrator. M/S Ernst and Young is 
    appointed as Chartered Accountants to carry out the valuation. A 
    regards the modalities for holding the auction and the buy out, the 




                                                
    modalities suggested by Nafan are proper and can be adopted.

    the manufacture of yeast.   Lesaffre family set up the manufacture 
    of yeast in France around the year 1873.  Muthu met Alain Laloum

    Muthu was keen to have a joint venture with Lesaffre.  SAF Yeast 
    was   incorporated   on   3   August   1981,   pursuant   to   an   agreement

    hold majority shares.   It was therefore provided in the agreement 
    dated 6 June 1981 that in the event the laws of India are amended 
    and   it   is   made   legally   permissible   to   hold   the   majority   interest, 
        


    Muthu   would   transfer   the   necessary   shares   to   Lesaffre   or   its 
     



    subsidiary, and that they would then hold majority of equity capital. 
    When SAF Yeast was incorporated, the word 'SAF' was derived from 
    the name Lesaffre and the interim license agreement was entered 





    into between Lesaffre and SAF Yeast on 11 December 1982, after 
    obtaining   requisite   approvals.     Lesaffre   was   issued   6000   equity 
    shares comprising of 40% of equity capital.   On 22 March 1991, 





    Lesaffre and Muthu entered into a participation agreement to up-
    date   the   agreement   of   6   June   1981.   ", Article   6',    of   participation

    the Calyon Bank by letter dated 2 March 2001.   It was suggested 
     



    that the offences were non-compoundable and Court at Hardoi had 
    taken   cognizance   against   the   Calyon   Bank.     Muthu   sought 
    intervention   through   a   Judge   and   after   certain   discussions, 





    proposed certain terms and settlement.   The nominee Directors of 
    Nafan,   bonafide   believed that  reasonable  settlement with Calyon 
    Bank as the bankers would be in the interest of SAF Yeast; however, 





    the terms put-forth by Muthu were not reasonable.

    Calyon Bank was something that could be used to their advantage 
                                     
    by placing Nafan in difficulties.  Muthu started his attempts to force 
    Lesaffre to sell 51% shares held by Nafan so that he could control 
                                    
    SAF   Yeast.     The   minutes   of   the   meeting   of   14   April   2005   were 
    incorrectly recorded and when it was pointed out, Muthu disputed 
    the position.  Correspondence ensued between the parties. Alain De 
           


    Gouy  informed   Muthu   that  on  Lesaffres intervention, the  Calyon 
        



    Bank was agreeable to certain terms and conditions.  Alain De Gouy 
    asserted  that   Lesaffre   was not   acting  against  the  interest   of SAF 
    Yeast and it was not a shareholders' dispute.

    that   he   was   being   forced   to   take   certain   decisions   in   respect   of 
    Calyon   Bank,   clearly   trying   to   make   out   a   case   against   Nafan. 
    Nafan  never  attempted to order Muthu  in  this regard and acted 
    only to ensure that the decisions were taken in the best interest of 
    SAF Yeast.   Muthu purportedly held a Board meeting on 26 July 
    2005, without any notice to the nominee Directors of Nafan where

    meeting,   if   held,   was   void.     The   deletion   of   Nafans   name   from 
    members   register   was  non-est.     The   steps   taken   by   the   Muthu 
    Group,   and   Muthu   in   particular   were   oppressive,   fraudulent, 
    unjust, and unfair.  They had acted contrary and against the Articles 





    of Association and the Participation Agreement of SAF Yeast.  They 
    acted   in   breach   of   fiduciary   duty.   Nafan   had   lost   confidence   in 
    Muthu Group and   since SAF Yeast essentially have been a quasi-
    partnership between two groups; Nafan was no longer in position 
    to carry on business with the Muthu Group as a business partner.

    The allegations made against Sharp & Tannan, statutory auditors 




                                                                                   
    are baseless and denied.   The SAF Yeast furnished a copy of the 
    MOU   dated   29   January   2009   to   the   statutory   auditors.     It   was 




                                                          
    recorded   in   the   memorandum   that   Muthu   Group   would   buy 
    shareholding in Nafan  and SAF Yeast and fair valuation is to be 




                                                         
    done by the auditors.   Since Sharp & Tannan were the statutory 
    auditors, after request was made to carry out the valuation, Sharp 
    & Tannan issued certificate of valuation on 9 February 2009.  Since 




                                             
    there   was   an   urgency,   the   valuation   report   was   prepared 
                                   
    expeditiously. It was forwarded to Laloum under cover of its letter 
    dated 10 February 2009.

',     10.    In   response   to   the   query   raised   by   Foreign   Exchange 
    Department of Reserve Bank of India, Sharp & Tannan confirmed 
        


    that it had followed Controller of Capital Issues ( CCI) guidelines 
     



    for valuation of equity shares of the Company.   It is incorrect to 
    state that the valuation is a scrap of paper, without sanctity and 





    validity.  It is denied that the valuation is fraudulent or ridiculously 
    low or there has been any collusion.  It is denied that the valuation 
    was carried out to cause wrongful loss to Nafan and give advantage 





    to the Muthu Group.

',     11.    Sharp & Tannan has nothing to do with the dispute, as it was 
    never a party to any decision for deletion of the name of Nafan 
    from the members register.

', u"    (i)             Muthu   is   a   Mechanical   Engineer   with   45   years' 
                                   
    experience in production, distribution, and use of yeast in baking 
    and production of alcohol.   He was instrumental in setting up a 
                                  
    brewery and a yeast factory for his past employer - Shaw Wallace & 
    Co.     He   met   Laloum   in  May   1980   at   an   exhibition   and   Laloum 
    showed   interest   in   setting   up   a   factory   in   India   since   he   had 
        


    connections   with   India.     He   was   impressed   with   Muths 
     



    knowledge.    Lasaffre  Group had no experience  of manufacturing 
    yeast outside of Europe or any experience of using 100% yeast, and 





    of the Indian conditions.  They, therefore, had no option but to tie 
    up with someone like Muthu.   A joint venture was formed on 6 
    June 1981.  SAF Yeast was incorporated on 12 August 1981.  There 





    were three Directors, Muthu, B.B. Paymaster, and Lucian Lesaffre. 
    Muthu was the Managing Director right from the inception.  It was 
    the obligation of the Lesaffre Group to provide technical assistance, 
    which they failed to do.

',     without any assistance from Lesaffre.  He raised loans from various 
    banks and gave personal guarantees.   Lesaffre Group did not give 




                                                              
    any such guarantee.   When the factory became functional, it was 
    found that strength of yeast given by Lesaffre was unsuitable and 




                                                             
    Lesaffre   had   rendered   no   technical   assistance   or   advise.     Muthu 
    made efforts to get the correct strength.  As the factory at Chiplun 
    progressed, a second factory was set up at Sandhila through efforts 




                                                 
    of Muthu.  The assertion of Nafan that the name SAF comes from 
                                     
    Lesaffre   is   not   correct.     The   participation   agreement   dated   22 
    March   1991   was   not   to   be   acted   unless   the   clauses   were 
                                    
    consequential   to   the   Articles   of   Association.     The   participation 
    agreement was never in accordance with the Articles of Association.

',     (iii)             The participation agreement was never acted upon and 
     



    the   parties   always   acted   in   accordance   with   the   Articles   of 
    Association.       Several   Board   meetings   were   held   in   India   when 





    none   of   the   Lesaffre   nominees   attended   and   in   spite   of   this 
    position, the decisions were accepted.  This was because Articles of 
    Association clearly stipulated that for Board meeting held in India, 





    there   is   no   requirement   to   give   notice   to   the   Directors   based 
    outside India.

    SAF   Yeast   underwent   a   change   and   share   of   Muthu   Group   was 




                                                          
    reduced to 49%.  A financial and technical collaboration agreement 
    was executed on 19 March 1993 in furtherance of the agreement 




                                                         
    dated 19 October  1981.   This agreement dealt  with dividend by 
    SAF  Yeast  to  Lesaffre   Group.   The  Government  of India through 
    Ministry   of   Industries   approved   increase   of   the   shareholding   of

    regarding   foreign   exchange   dividend   payment   were   laid   down. 
    Sometime in the year 1996, Lesaffre requested SAF Yeast to obtain 
                                  
    molasses from one Ganesh Benzoplast for exporting it to Lesaffre 
    Group.     Certain   dispute   arose   between   SAF   Yeast   and   Ganesh 
    Banzoplast.     Arbitration   proceedings   were   filed.     Initially,   the 
        


    Arbitrator gave an award in favour of SAF Yeast, directing Ganesh 
     



    Benzoplast to release molasses to one M/s. NSC Estates Pvt. Ltd.

    condition that NSC Estates Pvt. Ltd. would be liable to make good 
    the loss.  SVG Amsterdam, a Dutch company was to make payment 
    for the export contract under a letter of credit by Meespierson NV

    drafted.  Muthu sent an e-mail on 13 November 2005 denying the

    relationship with Calyon Bank at the cost of SAF Yeast.   He also

    that the minutes of the meeting dated 14 April 2005 were correct

    reiterated   that   Nafan   and   Lesaffre   were   consistently   siding   with 
    Calyon Bank.  On 12 April 2006, Nafan and SAF Yeast asked Muthu 
    for minutes of general meeting since 2003, details of transfer of

    next   morning.     On   23   January   2009   Laloum   and   Muthu   had   a 
                                   
    meeting   in   the   hotel.     Before   the   meeting,   Muthu   spoke   to   J.L. 
    Meurant on Laloum's phone.  Muthu reiterated that Muthu Group is 
                                  
    not   interested   in   selling   its   shareholding.     Laloum   stated   that 
    Lesaffre Group should make an offer of sale of their shares in SAF 
    Yeast.  It was agreed that, to arrive at a fair value of shares, Articles 
        


    of Association would be considered.   Articles were faxed from the 
     



    head office of SAF Yeast to the Conference Department of the hotel. 
    After the Articles were read, Muthu agreed to suggestion made by 
    Laloum   that   Muthu   Group   would   pay   Lesaffre   Group   a   price   of 





    shares as determined by the Auditors in accordance with ", Article 17.',  
    At   the   instructions   of   Laloum,   Muthu   wrote   the   MOU.     Laloum 
    carried out corrections to the document in his own handwriting and 





    initialed them.  Immediately on signing the MOU, Laloum informed 
    Meurant   who   also   spoke   to   Muthu   and   thanked   him   for   long 
    association with the Lesaffre Group.  Alain Laloum also forwarded a 
    copy of the MOU on 24 January 2009 to Meurant, which Nafan had 
    suppressed.

    Muthu sent an e-mail to Meurant with a copy to Laloum about the 





    further   steps   taken   pursuant   to   the   MOU.     Muthu   tried   to   call 
    Meurant   on   several   occasions   from   11   February   2009   to   18 
    February 2009 but Meurant was not available in the office.  Laloum 





    informed   Muthu   that   Nafan   could   not   locate   the   original   share 
    certificate.  Between March and April 2009, Muthu took the matter 
    of transfer of shares pursuant to the MOU and copy to Laloum and 
    Corinne Wisniewski regarding the steps of process for completing

    requested for a meeting.   Muthu drew attention of Laloum to the 
    petition pending before the Supreme Court.   Though Laloum was 
    confident that they had not committed any contempt, Muthu kept

    agreed at the start of the meeting that it would be a final attempt to 
    explore the settlement.  As Muthu had travelled, long way to meet 
    Laloum, Lesaffre felt obliged to Muthu.  Muthu insisted on calling 
    upon Articles of Association and got them faxed.   He insisted on

    arriving by fax, they should sign a memorandum so that whatever

    as it was his understanding that it was only his proposal to Denis 
    Lesaffre.       In   that,   light   Laloum   signed   the   proposal.     After   the

    never discussed in the meeting what are the consequences of the 
                                  
    sale of shares. What was signed was not an agreement for sale of 
    shares held by Nafan in any Company.   Lesaffre family could only 
    do this.   Laloum enquired about the valuation because he wanted 
           


    to know if it was worthwhile to follow up with Muths proposal.

    the   MOU   being   a   binding   agreement   to   transfer   the   share,   is 
    incorrect.   The case put up in the reply is fraudulent, the alleged

    the loans provided by Lesaffre and through its good offices   from

    convinced Muthu to agree to postponement of hearing to give more 
    time from the perspective of Nafan to settle differences regarding 
    shareholder agreement.   During this period, Muthu came to know 
        


    that Laloum's decision would be placed before Lesaffre family that

    insisted upon a meeting as a condition for postponement of hearing 





    before the Apex Court.  The manner in which Muthu acted during 
    this meeting is already set out in the affidavit of Laloum.   What 
    Laloum  signed  was  in   nobody's contemplation  as  a contract  and

    Laloum was shocked at the low valuation and immediately spoke to 
    Muthu   and   told   him  that  it  will  be  for  the   Board  of  Lesaffre  to 




                                              
    consider.   The valuation was so ridiculously low that no attention 
                                    
    was given to the assertion of Muthu regarding MOU.  The valuation 
    sent along with letter dated 10 February 2009 was addressed to 
                                   
    Laloum and not to Lesaffre  or Nafan.   The valuation was at the 
    instance of SAF Yeast.   If the Auditor had addressed the valuation 
    to Lesaffre, they could not have made a ridiculously low valuation.

    manner in which the valuation was carried out and the speed at 





    which it was carried out was entirely suspicious.  The valuation was 
    done by Nafan from reputed firms of Chartered Accountants would 
    show that the valuation of SAF Yeast was wholly fraudulent.  Even 





    the well settled methods of valuation were not applied.

    there was any truth in assertion of Laloum, then he should have 
                                   
    affirmed the petition as being the person most likely involved in the 
    proceedings. The case that MOU is a mere proposal is contrary to 
                                  
    the averments made in the petition.  The MOU was culmination of 
    series   of   meetings   to   settle   the   dispute.     Laloum   had   a   clear 
    authority to execute the MOU.  The averments made by Laloum in 
        


    the affidavit were dealt with parawise and denied and the fact that 
     



    the MOU was binding and Laloum had the authority was reiterated.

    (ii)              The MOU is valid and binding contract and the shares

    and  full consideration  has been  paid. Only basis to discredit the

    would clearly show that Laloum did dine with Muthu in his room. 
    Laloum did not appear to suffer from any physical incapacity.   He 
    had travelled to Algeria clearly indicating that  he had no health 




                                               
    issues.  Meurant was fully aware of the meetings between Laloum 
                                     
    and Muthu.  The Articles of Association were specifically called for. 
    Thereafter the MOU was executed.  Laloum did not appear to be in 
                                    
    any physical discomfort.   After the shares were transferred, there 
    was   no   question   of   withdrawing   the   proceedings   before   the 
    Allahabad High Court since transfer of shares was subjudice in the 
        


    Company Petition.  Laloum had full authority to execute the MOU. 
',      



',     The   valuation   done   by   Sharp   &   Tannan   was   proper   and   after 
    considering all the relevant material.  No capital can be made of the 
    fact that valuation was prepared in a short time span.  The Sharp & 





    Tannan are auditors for around 27 years and therefore they were 
    fully aware of the finances.  The criticism made on the valuation is 
    based on incorrect figures.  Lesaffre Group in the past had accepted 





    the valuation of the auditors without questioning the basis or the 
    integrity of the valuers.

    the   Nafan   had   not   suppressed   material   and   vital   facts,   and   the

    was   not   obtained   by   fraud   or   inducement   and   Laloum   had   the

    transfer notice must fulfill both the conditions stipulated in ', Article

    shares and it must appoint the Company as an agent for finding a 
    transferee.     The   first   part   of  ', Article   14',   is separate,  distinct,  and 





    independent of latter part of ', Article 14',  and that the contention of 
    Muthu Group that Articles 15 and 18 are applicable is incorrect.

    however   held   that   the   meeting   dated   29   January   2009   was   not 
    oppressive because it was in terms of the MOU.   The Board held 




                                             
    that the meetings held on 23 and 25 May 2009 were bad in law 
                                   
    since no notice was served and no agenda was circulated, and they 
    were   oppressive     The   Board   came   to   the   conclusion   that   the 
                                  
    valuation prepared by Sharp & Tannan was not reliable.  Valuation 
    report was a got up document and biased.   The valuation report 
    deliberately   used   CCI   Guidelines   though   they   were   inapplicable. 
',         


',     The  Board  held  that   there  was no request  in writing by Laloum 
     



    regarding  the  duplicate share certificates and that ', Article  18',  did 
    not authorize the Company to carry out any transfer in absence of 
    original share certificates.  The Board further concluded that the act

    Lesaffre   were   directed   to   transfer   the   shares   to   Muthu   Group 
    proportionate to their shareholding.  To carry out a fair valuation, 
    the Board of Directors was suspended and kept in abeyance.  Until 
        


    the valuation was concluded, an administrator was appointed.  The 
     



    administrator   so   appointed   was   authorized   to   appoint   an

    of receiving the consideration, the administration function would 





    come to an end.   Accordingly, the Company Petition was disposed

    the case of Muthu Group before the Board indicates that Lesaffre 
    can   be   considered   as   a   person   aggrieved.    In   the   facts   and 
    circumstances, therefore, the appeal filed by Lesaffre needs to be 




                                                
    considered on merits along with the appeal filed by Nafan.  When 
                                   
    Mr.   Dwarkadas   had   initially   raised   the   contention   regarding

    be decided at the time of final order and Mr. Khambata on behalf of 
    Lesaffre   has   made   the   submissions   on   merits   as   well.     I   am 
    therefore not inclined to dismiss the Appeal No.24 of 2015 filed by 
        


    Lesaffre only on the ground of maintainability. Lassafre is entitled 
     



    to   contend   that   the   directions   issued   to   it   should   be   set 
    aside.However a positive relief,if any, can only be granted to Nafan 
    as per its prayers in the petition.

    directions.     The   term   'oppression'   generally   refers   to   a   conduct 
     



    which is wrongful and harsh.  It refers to a lack of probity and fair 
    dealings   in   the   affairs   of   the   Company.     Oppression   can   be   in 
    different forms.     Something, which is illegal may not always be 





    oppressive   and   something   which   is   legal   may   be   oppressive.     A 
    deliberate act to cause harm to the members of the Company in 
    respect   of   the   affairs   of   the   Company   would   be   an   act   of 





    oppression.  Therefore, the enquiry in such matters will be focused 
    on probity and fairness in dealing amongst the shareholders, rather 
    than only testing only the legality of the actions.

                will be granted if the petitioner establishes that at the time

    existing, on record.    Apex Court in the case of Associate Journals  




                                                          
    Ltd. v/s Mysore Paper Mills Ltd.5      has  held that even if there is 
    slight error or irregularity in filing an affidavit, opportunity needs 
    to be given to the party to cure the defect.   The Apex Court has 




                                              
    held   that   the   rules  of  procedure  cannot  be  a tool  to  circumvent 
                                   
    justice   and   procedural   objections   cannot   be   used   to   defeat   to 
    justice. The ultimate objection of Muthu Group to the verification 
                                  
    of Mr. Siraj Ahmed is that the concerned persons have put him up 
    to avoid taking a stand on oath.   This objection does not survive 
    once the concerned persons i.e. Laloum and Lesaffre have put forth 
        


    their stand on oath and have taken a responsibility as to what is 
     



    stated   in   those   affidavits.     Simplicitor   dismissing   the   Company 
    Petition   on   that   ground   alone   would   have   only   meant   that   the 
    petition would have been filed again with same allegations for the 





    same   reliefs,   which   would   only   multiply   the   litigation.     In   the 
    circumstances, I am not inclined to interfere with the finding of the 
    Board that the Petition ought not to have been dismissed on this 





    count.

    material documents and material facts despite them being within

    impression that all these events and documents were always part of

    also shown that the new products were developed using indigenous 
    technology and the technology not of Nafan.   He submitted that 
    even notes of accounts for the year 2001 to 2003 have not been 





    produced which clearly show that the Muthu Group were the key

', u"    43.    I have considered the submissions.  Firstly, what is the exact 
    case made out by Nafan in this petition needs to be seen.  The relief 




                                                              
    sought by Nafan is that the register of members should be rectified 
    by inserting the name of Nafan in respect of 80,772 shares and an 




                                                             
    order   terminating   the   appoint   of   Mr.Muthu   as   the   Managing 
    Director and that Muthu Group be directed to sell their shares to 
    Nafan.     In   the   petition,   the   Nafan   has   pleaded   the   relevant 




                                                
    particulars.   It has placed on record the particulars of the parties, 
                                   
    the backdrop to the joint venture.  Then it stated that Muthu Group 
    is   attempting   to   prohibit   Nafan   from   participation   in   the 
                                  
    management.     It   is   attempting   to   compel   transfer   of   Nafan's 
    shareholding.  Muthu Group is committing acts of mismanagement. 
    It has inserted the name of Muthu Group as a shareholder of 51% 
        


    of   Nafan   although   Nafan   has   executed   no   share   transfer   deed. 
",      



',     Then, Nafan gives background how the dispute arose between the 
    parties is given by narrating the events that transpired leading to 
    litigation between SAF Yeast and Calyon Bank and the contempt 





    petition   filed   in   the   Allahabad   High   court   and   thereafter 
    proceedings in the Apex Court.   Nafan alleged that Muthu Group 
    failed   to   give   statutory   records,   minutes   of   Board   meetings, 





    financial   statements,   then   it   made   a   grievance   of   holding   Board 
    meetings   without   notice,  failure   to   provide   documents   regarding 
    litigation   and   how   in   spite   of   the   attempt   to   settle   the   dispute 
    settlement did not come through.  Thereafter Nafan has mentioned 
    how   Lucien   Lesaffre   received   a   notice   from   the   Registrar   of

    Companies to show cause regarding non-filing of returns.   It has 




                                                                                      
    then mentioned that Laloum informed Lesaffre and Corinne that he 
    has   been   induced   to   sign   some   papers   by   Muthu   and   he   has 




                                                              
    received some valuation addressed to SAF Yeast, which shows that 
    the valuation had no sanctity.  Then Nafan refers to a MOU stating 




                                                             
    that Nafan was not a party and cannot be aware of the same.  Then 
    it stated that around 28 May 2009, Muthu sent a letter stating that 
    shares are transferred relying on the MOU.  It is stated that Nafan 




                                                
    never agreed to sale its shares.  It is further stated that if the MOU 
                                   
    is produced, Nafan will raise and plead all its objections thereto.  It 
    is then stated that when the Board meeting was held at Paris on 29 
                                  
    May 2009 and the agenda was sent to Muthu, Muthu fraudulently 
    called   alleged   meeting   on   25   May   2009,   made   deposit   of   some 
    amount, and in accordance with ', Article 18',  struck off the name of 
        


    Nafan.     This   was   done   based   on   the   alleged   MOU   and   the 
     



    valuation, which were fraudulent.   Therefore, the entire thrust of 
    Nafan in the manner in which Muthu removed their names without 
    notice to them in a meeting. According to them, the MOU was not a 





    valid document and Nafan had never agreed to sell its shares.   It 
    had   specifically   stated   that   if   the   MOU   were   produced,   Nafan 
    would make its submission and take objections accordingly.

',     44.             It   is   not   that   the   MOU   and   meeting   with   Laloum   at 
    Montreux   have   not   been   mentioned   at   all   in   the   petition.     The 
    fundamental aspect of the acts of oppression is meetings without 
    notice and the transfer of shares.   There is no correspondence on

    record from Nafan or Lesaffre stating that they will abide by MOU 




                                                                                      
    and it should be placed before the Board, nor is a specific share 
    transfer   notice   given   by   Nafan.     The   entire   argument   of   Mr. 




                                                              
    Dwarkadas   on   this   count   is   based   on   the   silence   on   the   part   of 
    Nafan and Lesaffre Group regarding the MOU and enquiry about 




                                                             
    valuation.  According to him, once Nafan was made aware that the 
    MOU   exists   and   will   be   enforced,   then   by   not   taking   any   steps, 
    Muthu   was   right   in   believing   that   the   MOU   was   accepted.

', u"    According to Nafan, Muthu Group was trying to divert the course of 
                                   
    adjudication towards the legality, validity and binding effect of the 
    MOU, but from Nafan's point of view in the petition the real issue 
                                  
    in   the   matter   was   the   oppressive   nature   of   the   Board   meetings 
    through which the transfer of share have taken place.  
",         


',     45.    The Lesaffre and Nafan had made it clear through the e-mail 
     



    written by Corinne Wisniewski that the valuation was ridiculously 
    low.   Whatever may be the stand of Nafan and Lesaffre regarding 
    the MOU, apart from making general enquiries regarding valuation, 





    there   were   no   further   steps   taken   by   them   for   execution   of   the 
    MOU.  In fact, they had specifically made their intention clear that 
    they will not be going to do so in view of the valuation.  The MOU 





    did specify that there would be fair valuation and withdrawal of the 
    Court proceedings.  Therefore, according to Nafan, the MOU had to 
    be worked upon and taken further by both sides, rightly or wrongly, 
    which aspect is dealt with later.  The case of  Nafan in the petition 
    was   clear   that   it   not   ready   to   go   by   the   MOU.     They   did   not

    consider   it   as   a   valid   piece   of   document.   This   case   is   clearly 




                                                                                     
    reflected in the petition.  Therefore, the primary grievance of Nafan 
    that the way the meetings were held in which share transfer took 




                                                            
    place   without   notice   to   them   amounts   to   oppression.     It   is   the 
    Muthu Group, which is seeking, relies on the binding effect of the 




                                                           
    MOU.     The   contention   of   Mr.   Dwarkadas   is   that   the   MOU   is   a 
    binding   contract   and   non-disclosure   of   events   surrounding   the 
    transaction amount to suppression amongst others.

           For the purpose of examining the charge of suppression, even 
    assuming   the   MOU   was   binding,   the   action   of   Muthu   Group   to 
                                  
    transfer the shares without notice to them still could be questioned 
    by Nafan, which they did in the petition.   For that purpose, it is 
    enough   to   assert   that   the   MOU   had   no   sanctity.     There   is   no 
        


    complete omission to mention the MOU.  It is mentioned and it is 
     



    stated  that   it   is   invalid.     Nothing   further   needed  to   be   pleaded. 
    Whether it is binding or not would be the case of Muthu Group. 
    Nafan had reserved its rights to make comments on the MOU.  The 





    MOU is in fact is relied upon in defence of the actions taken by 
    Muthu   Group   to   transfer   the   shareholding   without   notice.     The 
    primary   grievance   of   Nafan   holding   a   meeting   without   notice 





    remains.   It is, therefore, not possible to uphold the contention of 
    Mr.   Dwarkadas   that   the   petition   itself   did   not   contain   cause   of 
    action and the rejoinder sought to supply the same and the petition 
    should   have   been   dismissed   on   that   count.     Nafan   had   clearly 
    reserved the liberty to rejoin in case the MOU is pressed in service

    has held that the pleadings should receive liberal construction and 
    whenever   question   of   law   regarding   the   pleading   is   raised,   the 
    enquiry   should   not   be   about   the   form   of   pleadings,   instead   the 




                                                
    Court must find out whether the parties knew the case and issues 
                                   
    contested.     Once   it   is   found   that,   in   spite   of   deficiency   in   the 
    pleadings,   parties   knew   the   case   and  they   proceeded   to   trial   on 
                                  
    those issues by producing evidence, it would not be open to a party 
    to raise  the  question  of absence  of pleadings.   Before  the Board 
    decided   the   matter,   all   the   parties   had   exhaustively   filed   their 
           


    pleadings   through   petition,   replies,   affidavits,   rejoinders,   sur-

', u"    rejoinders,   etc.   and   the   parties   were   fully   aware   of   each   other's 
    case.   The decision in the case of  Mohta Brothers  (supra) is of no 
    assistance   to   Mr.   Dwarkadas,   as   in   that   decision,   the   Court   was 





    concerned   with   the   subsequent   events   and   held   that   the   matter 
    needs to be decided upon the facts pleaded in the petition.  In the 
    present case, it is a grievance of Nafan that various facts leading to 





    the   meetings   were   suppressed   from   them,   which   they   came   to 
    know after filing of the petition and therefore rejoinder had to be 
    filed.  In this case, not only rejoinder but also sur-rejoinder has also 
    been filed.

    grant of relief under ', Sections 397',  and ', 398',  case must be made out 
    in the petition itself and the defects cannot be cured by evidence,

    the proceedings, the Board will have to take into consideration the

    different   from   exercised   by   the   courts   trying   civil   suit,   election

    on the ground of suppression of facts, when the facts the Petitioner 
    is supposed to have suppressed were the facts suppressed by the 
                                  
    Respondent from them.   As far as MOU is concerned, Nafan had 
    mentioned the same and made it clear that it is not considering it 
    as valid.  Why it was valid was the defence of Muthu group, which 
        


    they  put   forth.     Nafan  countered that  defence  in  their rejoinder.

',     Persons   concerned   filed   their   affidavits   placing   contested   factual 
    position   on   record.     It   is   not   that   Nafan   obtained   an   ex-parte 
    orderly misleading the Board. Both parties were fully aware of the 





    facts.  When the Board took up the matter for consideration, all the 
    facts were placed before it placed on record either by Nafan or by 
    Muthu Group.  It is after considering the entire record the CLB took 





    an informed decision and to my mind rightly did not dismiss the 
    petition on the ground of suppression of facts.

    pending in the Civil Court.   The Board has also taken note of the 
        


    position of law that it has no power to specifically enforce the MOU 
     



    but   what   the   Board   has   done   is   to   give   effect   of   the   supposed 
    understanding of the parties in the MOU, while passing an order 
    under ', Section 402', u" of the Act.  Mr. De'Vitre and Mr. Khambata have 





    seriously objected  to this submitting that this is indirectly giving 
    specific performance of the contract as the suit itself stands decreed 
    by the order of the Board.  On the other hand, it is the contention 





    of   Mr.   Dwarkadas   that   the   MOU   is   valid,   legal,   binding,   it 
    constitutes   a   transfer   notice,   and   therefore   there   was   no   act   of 
    oppression committed at all.

    validity of  the  MOU  but on whether the act of Muthu  Group to 




                                                                                     
    transfer the shareholding of Nafan and Lesaffre without notice to 
    them, even when they had made it clear that they were not abiding

    action   when   the   Muthu   Group   came   to   know   that   Nafan   and 




                                                           
    Lesaffre   were   not   going   to   honour   their   so-called   commitments 
    under   MOU   was   to   file   a   civil   suit   or   approach   the   Board   for 
    necessary relief.   The question is whether the Muthu Group could 




                                               
    have done it unilaterally without notice.   There could be various 
                                   
    angles,   such   as,   the   MOU   is   valid,   legal   and   binding,   and   it 
    amounts   to   a   transfer   notice;   the   MOU   is   not   legal,   valid   and 
                                  
    binding, and it does not amount to a transfer notice; the MOU is 
    legal, valid and binding but it does not constitute transfer notice; 
    the intention behind MOU can be taken into consideration while 
        


    passing an order under ', Section 402',  of the Act.  However, there is 
     



    yet another facet.   Should the Muthu Group have given a notice of 
    the Board meeting before transferring the shares on the basis of 
    MOU out of fairness and as a matter of probity?  Though I would 





    proceed to examine these viewpoints, as they have been agitated 
    before me at some length, I am of the opinion that it is the last 
    facet that should be kept at the forefront of the discussion.

', u"    58.    Mr. De'Vitre submitted that the finding that the MOU is valid 
    and binding could not have been made, as the Board does not have 
    jurisdiction to do so.   The MOU was a disputed document and at 
    the most an arrangement amongst the shareholders.  He submitted

    that the Board did not have any power to grant declaration of the 




                                                                                      
    validity, more particularly, since Muthu Group had already filed a 
    civil suit for specific performance.  To hold that the MOU is arrived 




                                                              
    with consent and for consideration and is nothing but to decide on 
    its validity.  He submitted that parties had initiated their respective 




                                                             
    proceedings in competent Courts.  The Muthu Group had initiated 
    civil   suit   in   this   Court   and   Nafan   and   Lesaffre   had   initiated 
    proceedings   in   the   Court   at   Switzerland.     He   submitted   that 




                                                
    dismissal   of   the   suit   in   Switzerland   was   only   on   the   ground   of 
                                   
    jurisdiction.  It was then submitted that, even assuming the Board 
    had jurisdiction, it could not have been directed Nafan and Lesaffre 
                                  
    to sell their shares.   He submitted that the MOU mentioned a fair 
    valuation and withdrawal of proceedings. The valuation was not a 
    fair valuation and Muthu Group had not taken immediate steps to 
        


    withdraw the contempt proceedings.  He submitted that Nafan did 
     



    not   ask   for   invalidation   of   the   MOU,   but   it   was   put-forth   as   a 
    defence by Muthu Group, and it is Muthu Group who is asking for 
    direction based on the MOU, in spite of the fact that they have filed 





    a civil suit.

    petition   itself   it   is   ascertained   by   Nafan   that   the   shares   were 
    transferred   based   on   non-existing   and   non-binding   MOU.     He 
    submitted that since having put up the case that the MOU was not 
    binding, Nafan could not be heard to say that the Board had no 
    jurisdiction to deal with their submission.   He submitted that the

    case pleaded by Nafan is that they were entitled to set aside the 




                                                                                      
    transfer of shares on the allegation that the MOU was not binding. 
    In view of this assertion, the Board had to consider whether the 




                                                              
    MOU was non-existent as alleged and whether Muthu Group was 
    justified on relying on the MOU.   He submitted that the suit was 




                                                             
    filed only to save the limitation and as a precautionary measure 
    and  there  will  be   no  contrary reliefs.     Mr.Dwarkadas submitted 
    that since Nafan had invoked the power under ', Section 402', , it was 




                                                
    open   for   the   Board   to   take   into   account   all   relevant   factors   for 
                                   
    ordering a buyout  to do substantial justice. According to him, the 
    Board   did   not   exceed   its   jurisdiction   as   MOU   and   the   events 
                                  
    leading to the MOU were made part of cause of action by Nafan 
    itself, which is clear from its pleading.   Mr. Dwarkadas submitted 
    that   the   decisions  relied upon   by  De  Vitre  and Mr.Khambatta to 
           


    contend that the Board does not have powers akin to Civil Court, 
        



    are not applicable as they deal with a party approaching the Board 
    seeking relief to enforce a contract.   He submitted in the present 
    case Nafan having entered into a valid and binding MOU has filed a 





    petition   to   resile   from   the   same.     He   further   submitted   that   no 
    party should be allowed to resile from a contract. It was open to 
    the   Board   to   consider   the   MOU   as   one   of   the   relevant 





    circumstances.     He   relied   upon   decision   in   the   case   of  Probir 
    Kumar   Misra   Vs   Ramani   Ramaswamy 16,  rendered   by   Madras 
    High Court, to contend that a MOU can be considered as a relevant 
    circumstance.   Mr.Dwarkadas further submitted that the contempt 
    petition came to be withdrawn within the legal frame work and it

    contempt petition, which had to depend upon orders of the Court. 
    He submitted that theory of Laloum being induced is false.  Nafan 




                                                            
    is changing its stand as regards the MOU, has taken contradictory 
    stand, and ultimately has admitted that the MOU exists.   He then 




                                                           
    relied upon the averments made  in the rejoinder by Nafan and the 
    additional affidavits.  Mr. Dwarkadas referred to various documents 
    on record in detail seeking to demonstrate that the MOU was not 




                                              
    an isolated piece of document but there were series of meetings 
                                   
    and exchange of e-mails, fax messages that led to execution of the 
    MOU. He submitted that the MOU is a clear and binding contract 
                                  
    and if Nafan had to wriggle out the same on the ground of fraud 
    and inducement, the heavy burden was upon it to demonstrate the 
    same.     The   MOU   fulfills   all   the   ingredients   of   being   a   binding 
        


    contract and Laloum who had full authority to do so executed it. 
',      



',     He also submitted that there is no uncertainty or vagueness in the 
    MOU.     It   is   handwritten.   Laloum   carried   out   corrections   and 
    initialed   them.     Laloum   is   an   experienced   business.   He   was 





    commercial   director   of   Lesaffre   group.   There   was   no   special 
    relationship with Muthu that he could have induced Laloum.   He 
    submitted that the conduct of the parties clearly shows that Nafan 





    and Lesaffre were fully aware of the MOU and did not raise any 
    objection, which would have been the first reaction if Laloum had 
    signed a contract without their authority.   He submitted that the 
    entire   conduct   of   Nafan   in   respect   of   this   MOU   is   fraudulent. 
    Mr.Dwarkadas   therefore,   submitted   that   the   primary   object   of

    finding   that   the   MOU   is   not   an   invalid   and   unenforceable 




                                                           
    document,   it   is   not   obtained   by   playing   fraud   on   Laloum,   and 
    Laloum   was   authorised   to   sign   the   MOU.     The   Board   also 




                                               
    concluded   that   the   MOU   was  not   vague   and  Muthu   fulfilled   his 
    obligations.   It also held that the MOU is made by free consent. 
',                                    
',     The   Board   relied   upon   the   decision   of  Bihar   State   Electricity 
                                  
    Board Vs Green Rubber Industries  -AIR 1990 SC P 693 to hold 
    that even though the party is ignorant of precise legal effect, it is 
    bound by the terms of contract it signs.   The Board distinguished 
        


    the decision cited by Nafan to hold that the Board can take note of 
     



    intention of parties and pass appropriate orders.   The Board also 
    took   note   of   the   argument   on   behalf   of   Muthu   group   that   the 
    agreement has already been implemented and therefore, question 





    of enforceability does not arise.
', 

',     61.    The Board has culled out an intention of the parties from the 





    MOU. It concluded that Nafan, with full knowledge and free will, 
    had   entered  into   a  MOU   for   sale   of   its  shares.   This  intention   is 
    relevant for considering buyout.    Board  accepted the position that 
    a specific performance of the MOU cannot be granted by it ,but has 
    taken the intention of parties into consideration. I do not think this 
    is correct. First, this would be doing granting specific performance.

    shareholdings to Muthu group is a dispute between two groups of 
    shareholders.     In   the   Apex   Court   in   the   case   of  ', Chatterjee 
    Petrochem (India) Pvt.  Ltd. v. Haldia Petrochemicals Ltd. and

    disputes regarding transfer of shares.  Similar view is taken in the

    thing is clear that when the Board meetings took place in May 2009 
    to transfer the shareholding of Nafan, Nafan had made it clear that

    it is not abiding by the MOU.   When Muthu sent an e-mail on 30 




                                                                                     
    April 2009, referring to the MOU, Ms. Corinne Wisnieswaski had 
    clearly   replied   on   3   May   2009   that   Nafan   cannot   even   think 




                                                            
    considering   the   price,   which   was   obviously   not   calculated   on 
    correct basis.  In spite of the specific e-mail, the same valuation was 




                                                           
    used to give effect to the MOU.  Therefore, when the act of transfer 
    of   shares   took   place,   the   Nafan   was   not   ready.     The   MOU   did 
    mention that there should be a fair valuation of shares.   The fair 




                                               
    valuation of shares therefore was one of the preconditions of the 
                                   
    MOU.   Naffan had made it clear that the valuation was not fair. 
    Therefore, dispute arose even within the terms of the MOU as to 
                                  
    whether   the   valuation   carried   out   was   fair.     The   amount   of 
    consideration for transfer was not fixed in the MOU.  It was to be 
    arrived   at   upon   a   fair   valuation.     Once   Nafan   insisted   that   the 
        


    valuation was not fair, the consideration could not be termed as 
     



    fixed. A clear civil dispute therefore arose even assuming that the 
    MOU was binding.  Muthu was fully aware that there was a dispute 
    as   regards   the   valuation   and   that   Nafan   was   not   ready   for   the 





    valuation.     In   spite   of   this   position,   meeting   was   held   without 
    notice and shares were transferred.

',     64.    It was contended by Mr.Dwarkadas that Nafan itself put the 
    validity of MOU into issue and therefore it cannot complain that the 
    Board adjudicated upon the same.  He submitted that it is case of 
    Nafan itself that the MOU is not a valid and binding and therefore 
    the Board had to adjudicate upon the same to hold that it is valid,

    binding,   and   properly   executed.     This   submission   cannot   be 




                                                                                   
    accepted.     Nafan   had   come   to   the   Board   making   a   grievance 
    regarding   the   meetings   held   without   notice   wherein   their 




                                                           
    shareholding   was   transferred.     Nafan   had   stated   in   the   petition 
    that, if MOU were relied upon then would reserve their right to 




                                                          
    contest the same.   It is the case of Muthu Group that MOU was 
    binding   and   it   is   wrongly   been   resiled   from   and   the   MOU 
    constituted a transfer notice.  The foundation of the case of Muthu 




                                              
    Group is the MOU and it is their main defence to the allegations of 
                                   
    oppression.    According to Nafan, MOU was at the most a proposal 
    to take the transaction forward and Muthu Group was attempting 
                                  
    to convert this memorandum into a binding contract.
', 

',     65.    Reference was also made by the Board to the decision of the 
        


    High Court in Switzerland in which the High Court has according 
     



    to   the   Board   held   that   the   MOU   is   a   contract.     However,   the 
    observations   and   the   operative   part   of   the   High   Court   order 
    reported in paragraph 82 of the impugned order itself shows that 





    the proceedings were dismissed for want of jurisdiction.  Therefore, 
    the   observations   made   in   the   decision   of   the   High   Court   of 
    Switzerland  could  not   have  been  held  against  Nafan.   The   legal 





    effect of MOU is already being agitated in the Civil Court where the 
    Court will decide its legality and validity. 
', 

',     66.    The question therefore, arises is whether it could be said that 
    the MOU was such a clear unequivocal document that it presented

    an open and shut case, and that a clear intention of Nafan to act on 




                                                                                     
    the MOU followed therefrom and all that had to be done was to 
    only complete the procedural formalities of transfer.   In given case, 




                                                            
    it may be argued that a clear intention flowed from an agreement 
    and for all purpose it was complete and only procedural formality 




                                                           
    remained and therefore the board even though cannot enforce the 
    agreement can look at the intention.  However, the present case, in 
    my   opinion,   cannot   be   pitched   at   that   level.     Can   an   absolute 




                                               
    conclusion can be drawn that the MOU was a concluded contract 
                                   
    with full knowledge, it has been acted upon and after it is acted 
    upon   only   a   procedural   formality   remains   and   at   that   stage   a 
                                  
    grievance is being made by Nafan.
', 

',     67.    The question therefore is whether Nafan and Lesaffre had no 
        


    case at all to dispute that they are not bound by the MOU and a 
     



    clear intention emerged.  Thus if they have a prima facie case that 
    the MOU was not to be acted upon and that theory is reasonably 
    possible then appropriate course of action  for Muthu group would 





    be to pursue their rights in the Civil Court. 
', 

',     68.    I have already concluded that there is no suppression on the 





    part of Nafan and the entire material on record is to be considered. 
    The MOU therefore, is now on record.  According to Muthu Group, 
    the MOU was a culmination of series of meetings.  Laloum had the 
    authority   to   sign   the   MOU   and   therefore,   it   is   complete   in   all 
    respects.   The   explanation   of   Nafan   and   Lesaffre   regarding   the 
    events   surrounding   the   MOU   is   through   the   affidavits   of   Denis

    Lesaffre and Laloum.  According to Laloum, the document i.e. MOU 




                                                                                 
    was only initiation of negotiation talks.  Both parties were to take it 
    forward. According to both Laloum and Mr.Lesaffre, this was at the 




                                                         
    best, a rough proposal to end the dispute.  Mr.Lesaffre has put on 
    record   that   when   they   came   to   know   about   the   valuation   they 




                                                        
    immediately concluded that the price indicated in the MOU was so 
    ridiculous that the proposal could not be taken forward.   Muthu 
    had   also   not   withdrawn   the  contempt   proceedings.    Laloum  has 




                                              
    stated that Lesaffre being a family business, the consent of family 
                                   
    members ought to have been taken.

',     69.    Looking at the version put up by Nafan, I do not feel that the 
    theory   put   forward   by   Nafan   and   Lesaffre   that   MOU   was   a 
    document   to   explore   possibility   of   settlement   could   be   rejected 
        


    outright as absurd.   After signing of the MOU there are no steps 
     



    taken by Nafan except to inquire about the valuation.   Once the 
    valuation was informed to Nafan and Lesaffre, their reaction was 
    that  the  valuation   was ridiculous.   The manner and the  form in 





    which   the   document   stood   executed   and   the   reaction   to   the 
    valuation  and  in  normal course  of business to transfer shares, it 
    could not be said that an unquestionable intention flowed from the 





    MOU.  Therefore, the Board even though it came to the conclusion 
    that Laloum had the authority to sign the contract did not consider 
    that fair valuation was one of the ingredients and after coming to 
    know   that   valuation   was   not   fair,   Nafan   and   Lesaffre   had   no 
    interest in taking the MOU forward.   Therefore, the Board fell in

', u"    70.    Both Muthu group as well as Nafan and Lesaffre are assisted 
    by   administrative   and   legal   staff,   as   their   correspondence   would 
    show.     In   normal   business   transactions,   solicitors   and   legal 




                                                         
    professionals  will  draw documents for transfer of shares.   Drafts 
    would be exchanged.   The understanding would be reduced to a 




                                              
    formal   documentation.    There  may   be   meetings  at   both   ends   to 
    finalise the decisions, there would be negotiations, discussions on 
                                   
    the price. Before the drafts are finalized, the parties could back out 
                                  
    for legitimate or otherwise reasons. If any steps were to be taken 
    before   completion   of   the   documents,   they   would   be   discussed 
    specifically.  This would be the practice followed in routine business 
        


    transactions.  In the present case, entire 51% shareholding of Nafan 
     



    is sought to be transferred. The value of the same clearly exceeds 
    millions of Euros.   It is difficult to believe  prima facie  that Muthu 
    and Laloum would simply write out the entire transaction by hand 





    on a small piece of paper in a hotel and part ways deciding that 
    51% shareholding is sold, and nothing further is needed, and  the 
    agreement   stood   concluded,   and   it   constituted   a   transfer   notice 





    which Muthu will unilaterally execute.   One may advance lengthy 
    legal   arguments   regarding   what   is   meant   by   a   contract   and   the 
    binding effects etc, but any reasonable man would say, in today's 
    age of commercialism and professionalism, this   is not the way of 
    two business groups of this level ,dealing with such high stakes,

    will conclude the transaction.  The theory put-forth by Laloum that

    importantly, no unquestionable intention can be culled out from it.

    Lesaffre family decides.   This also cannot be a fanciful version, as 
    Lesaffre is a family business.

           Therefore, it could not be said that the petition was filed by 
    only to resile out of the clear binding contract.   They had placed 
                                  
    their stand on record that they have no intention to take the MOU 
    forward.     Since   the   same   MOU   was   interpreted   to   derive   an 
    intention to order a buyout, it was nothing but indirectly granting 
        


    specific performance of the contract by the Board.  It cannot be that 
     



    Board concludes that it has no power to grant specific performance 
    of the agreement yet it will enter into disputed areas of intention of 
    parties  in  respect   of  the  said contract  adjudicated as to whether 





    intention exists and then give effect to the intention.    This is not 
    to lay down an absolute proposition then even in a case that all 
    ingredients   of   contract   are   satisfied   only   procedural   formalities 





    remain, both parties take all possible steps to see that the contract 
    is to be executed even in such circumstances the Board cannot take 
    entry of unquestionable intention.   The Board has in fact in para 
    165 of the impugned order rightly distinguished the case of Probir 
    Kumar Misra  (supra) relied upon by Mr.Dwarkadas, holding that

    in that case both the parties had substantially acted on the MOU, 




                                                                              
    but in the present case, it is not so.  In the present case, there is a 
    dispute between the parties.  Stand is taken by Nafan and Lesaffre 




                                                      
    that they had absolutely no intention to take any steps based on the 
    MOU considering the valuation.  Once their stand was clear , was 




                                                     
    prima facie tenable, it was not open for the Board to dissect the

    their stand regarding the status of the MOU at every stage.  Firstly, 
                                  
    they did not accept its validity and then when they had to accept it, 
    they  called  it   a  neutral  document. I am not  impressed with this 
    submission.  To my mind, the MOU is nothing but a red herring to 
        


    divert the controversy.   Assuming MOU exists, it is the manner in 
     



    which the shareholding of Nafan has been transferred which is the 
    crux of the dispute.

    withdrawal of contempt proceedings by Muthu group. The Board 
    has observed that Muthu group took immediate steps to withdraw 





    the contempt proceedings and it was not in the hands of the Muthu 
    group to withdraw the contempt proceedings.   It has been placed 
    on record that after the MOU there were 22 dates in the Courts and 
    at the stage of rejoinder arguments that the contempt petition was 
    withdrawn.   The Board has therefore, fallen in clear error to hold 
    that immediately after signing the MOU the contempt proceedings

',     Therefore,   even   assuming   Laloum   signed   the   MOU   and   Laloum

    the MOU was complete in all respects and was at such a stage that 
    even notices of its execution was not necessary.  In addition, there 
    is one aspect that is more important.  The MOU is being discussed 




                                                   
    in the context of oppression.   One thing was clear was that when 
                                   
    the board meeting on 25 May 2009 took place, Muthu was fully 
    aware that Nafan was not ready for the valuation and for going 
                                  
    forward with the transfer of shares.  Therefore, as far as Muthu is 
    concerned Nafan was not ready to act as per the MOU.  It is with 
    this knowledge that MOU is taken forward by Muthu. Though it is 
        


    contended by Mr.Dwarkadas that in spite of sending the MOU there 
     



    was no response and it must be presumed that Nafan and Lesaffre 
    had   no   objection,   it   is   too   nave   to   believe   that   in   spite   of   the 
    acrimony   that   existed  at   that  point  of  time   between  the  parties, 





    Muthu   would   innocently   believe   that   Nafan   and   Lesaffre   were 
    ready to go by the valuation prepared by M/s Sharp & Tannan and 
    all that remained was formality of transfer for which no notice was 





    necessary.     Therefore,   MOU   did   not   spell   out   a   clear   and 
    unequivocal intention to transfer the shares.  Therefore, though the 
    Board was right in considering that MOU could not be specifically 
    enforced, erred in relying on intention, which did not exist while 
    passing an order under ', Section 402', .  The question of the validity of

    the MOU has to be left to the Civil Court and I am of the opinion 




                                                                                               
    that the version of the Nafan regarding the MOU can be termed as 
    so absurd that they can be ordered to sell out their shares based on 




                                                                       
    the so-called intention under the MOU.   Furthermore, the crux of 
    the   matter   is   the   manner   in   which   the   meetings   took   place.

    appointed and notice was irrelevant because Muthu group would 
                                  
    have carried the votes in terms of their majority. He submitted that 
    there was quorum for the meeting and ', Section 299',  and ', 300',  of the

    of Nafan and Lesaffre, that the meeting dated 29 January 2009 did 
    not   take   place   and  the   meetings   were   fabricated,  the   Board   has 
    rendered a finding of fact that the meeting in fact was held and the 





    minutes were not fabricated.   The Board has concluded that the 
    charge of fabrication is akin to fraud and heavy burden lies upon 
    the party to make such allegation.   It is the contention of Mr.De' 
    Vitre that the minutes inter-se show complete inconsistencies.  It is

    the   contempt   proceedings.   However,   as   rightly   observed   by   the 
    Board that merely because there are contradictions in the minutes 
    does   not  per   se  lead   to   the   conclusion   that   the   minutes   are 




                                                
    fabricated.     The   failure   to   communicate   the   resolutions   and 
                                   
    minutes may amount to act of oppression and/or mismanagement, 
    but from this omission itself, it cannot be stated that the minutes 
                                  
    themselves   were   fabricated.     The   Board   has   taken   a   view   that 
    grounds provided by Nafan were not sufficient enough to prove the 
    charge   of   fabrication   which   required  high   degree   of   proof.    The 
        


    finding of the Board after scrutinising the evidence and considering 
     



    the burden of proof cannot be termed as perverse to be interfered 
    with   under   ', Section   10F',    of   the   Act.   What   is   legal   effect   of   the 
    meetings is of course open for consideration.

                be upset even if the Director knew of some fact, which made  
                the offer an attractive proposition. So in Percival v. Wright a  
                person who had approached a Director and sold him shares  




                                                               
                in   the   company,   afterwards,   upon   discovering   that   the  
                Director   had   known   at   the   time   of   the   contract   that  
                negotiations were on foot for the purchase by an outsider of  
                all the shares in the company at a higher figure, could not

                there   is   no   question   of   unfair   dealing   in   this   case.   The  
                                   
                Directors did not approach the shareholders with the view of  
                obtaining   their   shares.   The   shareholders   approached   the  
                                  
                Directors and named the price at which they were desirous

                members of their company in directing and managing the

                made  to them collectively. If the Directors mismanage the  
                company's   affairs,   they   incur   liability   to   pay   damages   or  
                compensation to the company or to make restitution to it,  
                but individual members cannot recover compensation for the  





                loss they have respectively suffered by the consequential fall  
                in   value   of   their   shares,   and   they   cannot   achieve   this  
                indirectly by suing the Directors for conspiracy to breach the  
                duties which they owed the company. However, there may be  
                certain situations where Directors do owe a fiduciary duty  
                and a duty to exercise reasonable skill and care in advising  
                members   in   connection   with   a   transaction   or   situation

    agreement   has   not   been   disputed   and   it   was   acted   upon.     The 
        

    Participation agreement was not unlawful, it was never cancelled,

    agreement can never be contrary to the Act as well as Articles of 
    Association.     However,   I   do   not   think   an   elaborate   discussion   is 
    necessary,   as   the   clause,   which   gives   an   additional   safeguard   of 
    notice, is not in conflict with the Act and the Articles of Association.

           Mr. De'Vitre, on the other hand, has countered each of the 
    assertions   of   Mr.Dwarkadas   and  contended  that  the  Participation

    agreement   when   income   of   the   Company   increased   and   the 
    shareholding,   additional   shares   were   offered.     Muthu   continued 
        


    beyond the expiry of 15 years.  Though Articles of Association did 
     



    not specify that meetings to be  held outside India, they were so 
    held under ", Article 7.10(a)',  of Participation Agreement and pointed

    the   exact   manner   and   which   circumstance   can   be   attributed   to

    the parties in terms of the Participation agreement took no steps at 
    all.  The Participation agreement existed.  Both the parties entered

    into   it.     Some   steps   were   taken   pursuant   to   the   Participation 




                                                                                    
    agreement   and   it   did   not  remain   only  a dead  letter. The  Muthu 
    group knew that the Participation agreement required notice to the 




                                                            
    directors   outside   India.     The   stand   of   Muthu   group   that   neither 
    Articles of Association nor the Act required that notice be given, 




                                                           
    apart from not being tenable, is not reasonable.  The argument that 
    in the past no such notices were given is also not tenable.   The 
    decision of exit of one group and bringing the association, which 




                                              
    existed   for   decades   to   an   end,   was   one   of   the   most   important 
                                   
    decision for SAF Yeast.  It was not an ordinary routine business to 
    be transacted.   Neither the Articles of Association nor ', Section 286',  
                                  
    prohibited issuance of notice  for such decision. The Participation 
    agreement   contemplated   issuance   of   notice.   Ultimately,   the 
    allegations of all acts of oppression are rooted more in fairness than 
        


    in   legality.     Once   the   Participation   agreement   existed   and   it 
     



    contemplated   issuance   of   notice,   it   was   only   reiteration   of   the 
    obvious, which is otherwise a requirement.  In fairness, the notice 
    ought to have been given.  It is the most unfair stand to be taken 





    that   the   Articles   of   Association   were   not   amended   to   include 
    Participation   agreement   even   though   it   was   acted   upon   in   same 
    manner,  and therefore, no notice  before  transfer of shareholding 





    was   required   to   be   given.     Such   argument   defies   all   notions   of 
    fairness.

    of   Association,   parties   knew   its   existence   and   the   fact   that   the 




                                                                                     
    Participation   Agreement   required  a   notice   to   the   Directors   to   be 
    given outside India. The Board rightly observed that since this term 




                                                            
    was not contrary to the Articles, and the Act, Muthu Group was not 
    entitled to  say  that  it  need not give  notice  because  Participation 




                                                           
    Agreement   was   not   part   of   the   Articles   of   Association. 
    Furthermore,   it   is   the   case   of   the   Nafan   and   Lesaffre   that   the 
    incorporation   of   Participation   Agreement   into   Articles   of 




                                               
    Association had to be done by Muthu.   When both the groups co-
',                                    
',     existed for more than 20 years and the meetings were to determine 
    the exit of one group, that too in acrimonious circumstances, notice 
                                  
    was required. Neither in the Articles of Association nor in ', Section 
    286',  nor in any decision dealing with the similar factual situation at 
    hand, has it been stated that it is not necessary to give notice in 
        


    such circumstances.  The findings of the Company Law Board that 
     



    the meetings of 29 January 2009, 23 May 2009 and 25 May 2009 
    were illegal for want of notice cannot be termed, as perverse. The 
    Company Law Board has also rightly taken note of the fact that the 





    agenda   of   the   meeting   was   not   circulated.     The   agenda   is   not 
    produced on record for the meetings of 29 January 2009, 23 May 
    2009, and 25 May 2009.  This is an additional ground.

    May   2009   were   illegal   and   oppressive.     As   regards   the   meeting 
    dated 29 January 2009, the Board has held that it is illegal but not 
    oppressive as it was as per MOU.  This finding is not correct.  The

    of acts of Muthu constituted ground of oppressive. It was a larger

    principles of valuation.   Muthu seem to have in hurry to call for 




                                                               
    valuation   as   the   events   unfolded,   which   have   been   discussed 
    subsequently, such as, the role of Sharp & Tannan.  The meeting of 
    21 January 2009 also has to be held as oppressive apart from being 




                                                  
    illegal.     The   finding   of   the   Board   to   that   effect   will   have   to   be 
    modified.

',     87.    Next heads of debate are whether the MOU could be treated 
    as a transfer notice, issuance of duplicate shares and the manner 
    of valuation of shares by the valuer.   I have already held that the 
        


    holding of these meetings without notice to the Nafan and Lesaffre 
     



    was illegal, unfair, and oppressive and the findings of the Company 
    Law Board on that count are not perverse, except the modification 
    above.  However, the main argument advanced by the Muthu group 





    is that the MOU was a transfer notice and transfer was effected as 
    per   the   Articles.   Question   then   arises   is   whether   the   MOU 
    constituted a transfer notice.   The learned counsel advanced the 





    detailed   submissions   on   the   interpretation   of   the   articles   to 
    demonstrate   that   the   MOU   can   be   treated   as   a   transfer   notice. 
    There   was   also   a   question   as   to   whether   the   transfer   between 
    member   to  member   is   covered  by  first  part   of  ', Article   14',   of   the 
    Articles of Association and the applicability of Articles 15, 18, 19

',     90.    Mr.Dwarkadas   assailed   the   finding   of   the   Board   on   the

    15', ,   17',    and   ', 22',    are   applicable   to   transfer   of   shares   between

    15',  and ', 19',  will apply only to a transfer to a non-member is incorrect 
    as seen from the scheme of the Articles.  He submitted that right to 
    transfer shares is not unfettered and the ', Article 14',  makes it clear

    that   even   transfer  inter-se  between   members   is   regulated   in   the 




                                                                                          
    manner   provided   by   the   Articles.     He   contended   that   Articles 
    contemplate transfer notice by A Person proposing to transfer any 




                                                                  
    shares and ', article 15',  applies even to a member-to-member transfer. 
    He   submitted   that   the   Articles   14   to   22   would   have   to   be   read 




                                                                 
    harmoniously.     According   to   Mr.Dwarkadas   ', Article   16',    has   no 
    application   in   the   case   of  transfer   between   members  inter-se.   As 
    regards ', Article 17',  read with ', Article 15', , according to Mr.Dwarkadas 




                                                   
    it would be in a case where there is a disagreement of the price of 
                                   
    shares to be transferred.  ', Article 19',  according to him applies only 
    where the proposed transferor has not contracted to sell his shares 
                                  
    to another member.  He contended that last sentence in ', Article 22', u" 
    contains words 'these articles' being in plural will apply event to 
    member   to   member   transfer.       According   to   Mr.Dwarkadas, 
           


    combined  reading  of  Articles as scheme  is to facilitate a smooth 
        



    expeditious transfer of shares by a member and it is for this reason 
    that   the   Articles   provide   for   distinct   schemes.     Irrespective   of 
    whether the transfer is between the members, which is covered by 





    first   part   of   ", Article   14',    it   has   to   read   with   15,   17,   18,   and   22. 
    Mr.Dwarkadas   placed   reliance   on   the   decision   of  Holmes   and  
    another   v   Keyas   and   others26,  rendered   by   Court   of   Appeal   in

",     93.    Discussion   on   this   aspect   needs   to   be   prefixed   by   two 





    fundamentals.  First, the articles will have to be read as a document 
    drafted   by   businessperson   to   conduct   their   affairs.     Second,   any 
    restriction in the articles must be spelt out with sufficient clarity.  If 





    we   read   ', Article   14',    plainly,   first   part   says   that   a   member   may 
    transfer  the   shares  or   other person  is  entitled  to transfer  to any 
    member selected by the transferor.  This part covers a contingency 
    of a transfer of share by a member entitled to transfer to any other 
    member.   In case of a public limited company listed on the stock

    exchange, the shares are generally freely transferable.  In a private 




                                                                                     
    limited company share  transfers can have restrictions.   However, 
    normally there is no absolute bar to transfer the shares.  As a broad 




                                                             
    proposition,   generally   law   does   not   recognize   an   embargo   on 
    transfer   of   shares.   The   first   part   of   ', Article   14',    therefore   merely 




                                                            
    reiterates the obvious position that a member can transfer the share 
    to   another   member.   This   obvious   position   is   stated   only   to 
    emphasize the restrictions that follow in the second part of Article 




                                               
',     14.  Second part states that the shares shall not be transferred to a 
                                   
    person who is not a member, as long as any member or any person 
    selected by the directors is willing to purchase the same at a fair 
                                  
    value.  Such embargos are placed in closed held Company to keep 
    them that way, discouraging the outsiders.  The ', Article 15', , 16', , 17',  
    and   ', 18',    thereafter   lay   down   a   methodology   where  the   Company 
        


    gets involved for transfer of shares and steps in as an agent.  There 
     



    is   no   logic   for   going   through   the   entire   process   of   making   the 
    Company an agent if the share transfer is between the members. 
    The   Articles   are   drafted   by   the   businesspersons   to   govern 





    themselves.   When one member decides to transfer the shares to 
    another,   they   would   inform   the   Company.     There   is   no   special 
    reason why in respect of this Company they should go through the 





    entire gamut of making company the agent.  This document simply 
    and clearly contemplates this elaborate machinery for member to 
    non-member transfer.  The reading of the articles need not be made 
    deliberately   complicated   and   opposed   to   common   sense,   merely 
    because such interpretation     justifies the action taken by Muthu

    to be interpreted in a routine manner, any reasonable reader would 
    read them as for member-to-member transfer, there is no question 




                                                            
    of   making   the   Company   agent,   fair   valuation   etc.   The   articles 
    cannot be read in absurd manner or only because reading them in

    finding  of  the  Board  that clause  14 is a distinct scheme  did not 
    subject to restrictions in the other articles, is a possible view to be 




                                              
    taken, and is not perverse.

    fair value mentioned therein will lead to absurd reasons.   There

    of Mr.Dwarkadas is to be accepted, it will mean fair value has to be 
    fixed only after the Company received the transfer notice.  Then it 
        


    will   be   that   there   will   be   no   contract   of   sale   until   the   transfer

    Articles. If they wanted to place restrictions on themselves for inter-
    se transactions by providing a methodology to give notice to the 





    Company to appoint a valuer and fixed fair value, they would have 
    been so specifically provided.  Such interpretation cannot be foisted 
    because   it   validates   the   acts   of   one   group.     The   interpretation 





    placed on these articles has to be seen in the context of charge of 
    oppression of  unilaterally taking MOU as notice  and transferring 
    the shares.  Question therefore is, whether the articles were so clear 
    in   their   purport   that   even   no   notice   was   necessary.     For   any 
    businessperson reading these articles, the interpretation placed on

                entitled to purchase shares upon transfer. The first right is  
                given   to   the   preemptors   under   ', Article   57-A.',    Next   in   the

                hierarchy   is   any   member   who   is   willing   to   purchase   the  
                shares at a fair value. This follows from a reading of Article  




                                                                                        
                with Article The third category is of any person or persons  
                selected by the Directors as being desirable in the interest of  




                                                                
                the company to admit to membership. The last category is  
                the person to whom the transferor may choose to sell the  
                shares. As long as there is any person in a higher category,  
                there is no question of sale or purchase by a person in a  




                                                               
                lower category. Thus for example the right of a member or a  
                person in the 2nd category to purchase shares can arise only  
                in the event there is a default or refusal on the part of the  
                preemptor and so on. A person may fall within any one or  




                                                  
                more of these four categories and would, by virtue of these  
                articles   have   distinct   and   separate   rights   to   purchase   the  
                                   
                shares in each of the four categories. So even if a preemptor  
                or a nominee of a preemptor does not exercise his/her right  
                                  
                under ', Article 57-A', u" to purchase the shares at a price certified  
                by   the   company's   Auditors,   such   person   may   choose   to  
                exercise the right as an ordinary member and purchase the  
                share at a fair value or the transferor may choose to sell the  
        

                shares to such person under ", Article 63.', 
     



', u"                24.2      In the case of a transfer to a person in the 2nd and  
                3rd   categories   of   putative   purchasers,   the   Directors   are  
                appointed agents of the transferor. The notice of transfer is  





                required   to   constitute   the   Directors   as   the   transferor's  
                agents. This notice is distinct from the other required to be  
                given under ", Article 57-A.',  In respect of these two categories,  
                the price of the shares is at first to be negotiated with the  
                transferor.   It   is   only   in   the   case   of   a   default   in   such  





                agreement being reached that the company's Auditors step in  
                and fix a "fair price". The third distinctive feature of these  
                two categories is that upon refusal/default of the preemptor,  
                the transferor is required to give a notice in writing of his  
                desire to transfer. Giving of this notice must necessarily be  
                subsequent   to   the   failure   of   ', Article   57-A',    for   whatever  
                reason, as the Directors are required to find a willing person

                would be at liberty to sell the shares to any person and at  




                                                   
                any price, albeit also within a period of 30 days from the  
                expiry of the first period of 30 days. It follows that a notice  
                                   
                issued prior to the preemptor exercising or failing to exercise  
                the right under ', Article 57-A',  would not be in keeping with  
                                  
                Articles and 60 as this would make the period of 30 days  
                uncertain if not illusory. Thus the notice by the transferor  
                under Article must succeed the factual failure of ', Article 57-A',   
                and notice, if any, under Article must follow the failure of  
        

                Article.

                there is no time limit fixed either for the parties to arrive at  
                a negotiated price or for the Auditor to fix a fair value. But  





                Article   indicates   that   the   entire   transaction   envisaged   by  
                Articles 59, 60, and 62 would have to be completed within a  
                period of 60 days after ', Article 57-A',  failed to operate."

',     It can be seen from the above that the Apex Court categorized the 
    seller and buyer of the shares and applied a different yardstick. The 
    Apex   Court   did   not   hold   that   even   in   case   of   first   category,   the 
    directors were to be appointed as agents.  This decision was sought 
    to be distinguished by Mr.Dwarkadas on the ground that the right 
    of pre-emption was conferred on specific persons and there was no

    cannot be brought in to cover member-to-member transfer.   Even

    by the transferor.  As regards the decision by the Malaysian Court in 
    the case of  Lo Mu Sen (supra), once there is a decision of the Apex 




                                                
    Court interpreting similar Articles holds the field, it is not necessary 
                                   
    to refer to the same.  Mr.De'Vitre has relied upon the decision in the

    otherwise   as   it   is   rightly   pointed   out   by   Mr.De'Vitre   in   the   case 
    before the Malaysian Court, the Company was a family Company 
        


    and the founder of the Company, father had wished that shares will 
     



    be held by the children in a particular proportion and it is in that 
    background that the factum of transfer was considered.

    scheme as is sought to be interpreted applies, whether this MOU 
    constituted   a   transfer   notice   and   the   agency.     According   to 





    Mr.Dwarkadas there is no particular format provided for a transfer 
    notice.  He submitted that all that is required is the intention.  Once 
    there   is   a   desire   to   transfer   the   shares,   it   will   constitute   the 
    Company   as   its   agent.     It   is   also   contended   that   the   agency   is 
    created by the Articles and not by a transfer notice  per se.  It was

    notice   of   transfer.     Mr.Dwarkadas   submitted   that   any   document 




                                                             
    which   shows   that   there   is   an   intention   to   sell   can   constitute   a 
    transfer notice.  Reliance was placed on the decision of the English

    no specific need to address any separate notice to the Company.  It 
                                   
    was submitted that Laloum was fully aware that Muthu was the 
    Managing director  of the Company and the signing of the MOU in 
                                  
    the circumstances constituted sufficient notice.

',     100.     The Board rejected the contentions of Muthu group on the 
        


    ground that the ', Article 15',  and the other modalities did not apply.  I 
     



    am in agreement with the view taken by the Company Law Board 
    that the scheme as propounded by Muthu group did not apply to 
    member-to-member transfer.  However, for sake of completeness, I 





    will consider the alternate position that even assuming the articles 
    as contended apply, whether MOU could be treated as a transfer 
    notice.

                to 63 were concerned. As we have already observed, notices

                not constitute the Directors as the transferor's agents for the

    The above-emphasized portion would show that unless a specific 
    notice is issued, there was no question of any agency being created. 
',      



',     The   Apex   Court   also   held  that   the   directors  must   be  specifically 
    constituted   as   an   agent.     Thus,   Apex   Court   laid   down   that   the 





    transfer notice itself must make the directors the agents.

    unambiguous notice will curtail future litigation such as the present 
    one. The MOU is not even a letter.  It is at the most an agreement

    absurd to suggest that since Muthu is a managing director, even

    constitute a notice to the Company.  Further MOU does not state a 
    word   of   expressly   authorising   the   Company   as   an   agent.     Such

    notice, but also the fact that the MOU was being treated as notice 
    and was placed before the Board of directors, was not informed to 
    Nafan and Lesaffre.  The case of Lyle & Scott Ltd. (supra) did not 




                                               
    arise from the case of oppression and mismanagement but arose 
                                   
    from civil suit for specific performance based on the pre-emptory 
    clauses.   Furthermore,   as   has   been   rightly   pointed   out   by 
                                  
    Mr.De'Vitre, the concerned articles in that case only envisaged an 
    intention   to   transfer   and   did   not   provide   for   a   formal   notice. 
    Furthermore, the action of treating the MOU as a transfer notice in 
        


    the present case is not to be considered as an isolated incident but 
     



    in   the   larger   scheme   of   things.     In   the   case   of    Re   Ringtower  
    Holdings   (supra) the Court concluded that there was no intention 
    to sell the shares in the facts of the case.     Merely because some 





    observations  can  be   used to support the  submission, a judgment 
    cannot be read de hors the factual backdrop.  Reliance on the case 
    of  Mannai   Investments   Co.   Vs.   Eagle   Star   Life   Assurance   Co.

    only illegal and contrary to the articles on the part of Muthu group 
    but in the factual backdrop, it was highly inequitable.   Therefore, 




                                                          
    not only the Board meetings that were held without Board's notice

    transfer notice.  It was argued that Muthu group acted based on the 
    opinion   of   a   senior   Advocate   and   therefore   their   action   was 
    bonafide.   The opinion of the senior advocate refers to ", Article 16', , 




                                              
    which according to Mr.Dwarkadas, does not apply.  It was agreed by 
                                   
    the counsel that it will be proper not to debate on the merits of the 
    opinion but to restrict  the debate only to bonafides.   The senior 
                                  
    advocate   did   not   opine   that   Muthu   group   could   proceed   in   the 
    manner as they have done.   Question here is the lack of probity. 
    Muthu   is   an   experienced  business.    He   fully   knew  what  he   was 
        


    doing.     The   opinion   is   only   used   as   crutches   to   support   an 
     



    otherwise oppressive act.

                this connection, we may also note that even though there is  
                not   statutory   provision   for   giving   any   notice   or  
                advertisement, when there is an established practice by the

    Yeast on behalf of Nafan that Nafan has lost the original shares,

    design to usurp the shareholding of Nafan.  Mr.Dwarkadas tried his 
    level best to justify the act as of Muthu group.  Most of the events

    amongst the Muthu group starting from 16 March 2009 till 25 May 
    2009.     The   argument   that   the   agency   created   in   favour   of   the 




                                                
    Company and the MOU itself impliedly gave the power to grant of 
                                   
    duplicate   share   certificates,   is   sought   to   be   raised   with   no 
    foundation in law.   Language of ', Section 84',  clearly speaks to the 
                                  
    contrary for any such implication. It was also submitted that the 
    case in Shoe Specialties (supra)  is distinguishable on facts.  It was 
    also   contended   that   not   every   conduct   need   be   considered   as 
        


    oppressive.  I am not impressed by any of these submissions.  The 
     



    conduct of issuance of duplicate certificates was clearly a part of a 
    design to remove Nafan and Lesaffre from the Company.  Once it is 
    held that meetings itself were illegal, the MOU did not constitute 





    the transfer notice, then get duplicate share certificates in absence 
    of  any written  authority only compounds the  acts of oppression. 
    What is sought to be done is that each act is sought to be justified 





    in   isolation,   but   what   needs   to   be   considered   is   totality   of   the 
    actions  leading  to  acts of oppression.   The  issuance  of duplicate 
    share certificates in this manner surely constituted one piece in the 
    large   scheme   of   their.     I   am   therefore,   in   agreement   with   the 
    Company Law Board in respect of the finding rendered by it on this

    Sharp   &   Tannan   has   deliberately   used   guidelines,   which   are 
    inapplicable.  The Board has concluded that the valuation report is

    the   observations   and   declarations   made   by   the   Board   that   the 
    report is biased, partial and in contravention of statutory guidelines 
    and rules to carry out valuation of shares of going concern.  It is the 
        


    contention of Nafan and Lesaffre that the valuation was done at the 
     



    instance of Muthu group, it was deliberately kept on the lower side 
    and prepared in short time span to meet the requirements of Muthu 





    group,   and   thus   in   collusion.     It   was   contended   that   right   from

    Sharp & Tannan as per his requirement.

    no   proof   in   support   of   allegations   of   collusion   and   fraud.     He

    valuation are never adverted to.  Merely because the RBI circular of 
    2010   mentions   Discounted   Cash   Flow   method   (DCF),   does   not 
                                  
    mean   that   is  the   only  method.    Mr.Subramaniam submitted that 
    there is nothing wrong in preparing a report within 24 hours and it 
    is easily possible when all the data is available on the computer.  He 
           


    reiterated   that   method   of   valuation   under   CCI   guidelines   is 
        



    legitimate method of valuation.  He relied on RBI Circular No.7 of 
    2008/2009   dated   1   July   2008   referring   to   CCI   guidelines.     He 
    submitted   that   the   Apex   Court   in   the   case   of  Hindustan   Lever 





    Employee's   Union   Vs.Hindustan   Lever   Ltd.40  and  Miheer 
    H.Mafatlal  Vs.Mafatlal  Industries Ltd.41  has laid down that  the 
    valuers   are   experts   in   their   field   and   Court   should   be   slow   in 





    substituting   their   findings.     Merely   because   an   expert   adopts   a 
    particular method of valuation in one case and the same method 
    not adopted in another case does not render the valuation bad. As 
    regards   the   contentions   about   suppression   in   the   pleadings, 
    Mr.Subramaniam supported the contentions of Mr.Dwarkadas.

    submitted that ', article 17',  was referred to in the MOU and parties 
    agreed to abide by the valuation of the statutory auditor.  Nafan did 
    not insist upon any valuation method in spite of having received 




                                              
    the MOU some time in February 2009.   He contended that if the 
                                   
    price of shares between 1992 and 2009 is concerned, it has grown 
    from   `237 per share to   `4315 per share. The same valuer had 
                                  
    carried out the valuation earlier.  In the year 1998, when Lesaffre 
    sold   its   shareholding   to   Nafan   the   shares   were   sold   at   `  1070. 
    Therefore,   since   1998   there   has   been   400   per   cent   increase   in 
           


    shares.  He submitted that unless the valuation is vitiated by fraud 
        



    or fundamental mistake the same could not be challenged.   The

    challenged  to  show  the  oppressive  acts of Muthu  group  and the 
    Board has rightly held that the way the valuation was carried out is 
                                  
    oppressive.     He   submitted   that   even   assuming   the   MOU   is 
    executable it contemplates fair valuation.  The valuation carried out 
    is not only not fair but no valuation in eyes of law. He submitted 
        


    that   the   valuation   does   not   take   into   account   the   well-settled 
     



    methods of valuation.   He submitted that the methods, which are 
    generally adopted and mandated, have not been carried out by the 
    valuer.   He submitted that CCI method is completely inapplicable 





    and in violation of the RBI instructions.   The valuation is absurd, 
    extremely low, completely unfair, and the Board has rightly set it

',     116.    The MOU referred to a fair valuation.  I have already held 
    that, prima facie the MOU only indicated beginning of modalities 
    depending on the fair value.   The fair value has to be seen in the 




                                                        
    light of the fact situation.   It was the value to be paid for exit of 
    Nafan   from   SAF   Yeast.  That  would  mean   that   the   association  of 




                                              
    Nafan and Lesaffre right from the beginning and its majority stake 
    in   the   Company   would   end.  Two   groups   of   shareholders   started 
                                   
    SAF   Yeast   together.     The  Company  is  well   established.    It  has  a 
                                  
    substantial turnover. Even assuming the case of Muthu that it was 
    contemplated   that   majority   shareholders   would   exit   upon 
    valuation; fair valuation was to be done by statutory auditor.  M/s 
        


    Sharp and Tannan have been the auditors of the Company for a 
     



    long time. With such a major decision being left to them, it was 
    their duty to be fair to both Muthu group, and Nafan and Lesaffre. 
    They would be fully aware what they were determining was the 





    price of exit of Nafan from the Company.   This is not to say in a 
    routine valuation, care need not be taken, in the present case but 
    M/s Sharp and Tannan were fully aware of the implications of their 





    valuation,  having been associated with the SAF Yeast for several 
    years. The manner in which the valuation was done in 24 hours, 
    when   there   was   apparently   no   need   for   such   urgency   without 
    following well known methods which has given rise to charge of 
    oppression by the Nafan and Lesaffre. Therefore, the entire issue of 
    valuation has to be viewed in that perspective. There is no doubt,

    24 hours to arrive at a valuation, which he knew was not reflecting 
    the   correct   value,   in   itself,   is   alleged   to   be   part   of   oppressive

    emphasized that the valuer need to give reasons why it excludes 
    well-established  principles of valuation  at all from consideration. 
    The contention that choice of method is a matter of pure discretion 




                                              
    of   the   valuer   cannot   be   accepted.     The   valuer   does   not   have 
                                   
    discretion   to   simply   disregard   well-known   methods   of   valuation

    without any reason , when they had to arrive at a fair valuation,in 
    these circumstances,was not a  proper exercise on the part of Sharp

                referred   to   the   following   valuation   techniques   which   are

                (DCF).  The chartered accountants have then discussed the  
     



                merits   and   demerits   of   the   different   techniques   and  
                thereafter suggested that since the DCF method captures all  
                the elements of the value of a business compared to the other  
                methods,   the   DCF   method   comprehends   the   difference  





                between   the   values   of   firms   having   similar   accounting 
                earnings   due   to   the   difference   in   capital   investments   and  
                other   cash   flows   required   to   sustain   these   earnings.   By  
                adopting the said technique, the chartered accountants have  





                worked   out   the   fair   value   per   share   of   Alembic   Ltd.   and

                The chartered accountants have, therefore, suggested that on

                fair and reasonable, a share exchange ratio of one equity

    not referred to DCF method at all.  An explanation is sought to be 
    given that the valuation had to be done  in a hurry in view of the

    that the valuation is carried out for the purpose of Circular of the 
    year 2004.  There is no gain saying that the valuation conformed to 




                                                           
    the parameters laid down in the RBI Circular of 2004, when the 
    Circular was not for fair value but for completely different reasons. 
    In fact, the Circular dated 4 May 2010-RBI has emphasized for DCF

    2004   indicate   the   way   Muthu   group   and   Sharp   &   Tannan   have 
    acted.  Reliance is placed on valuation methods, which are not for 
        


    fair valuation is required for completely different purpose under the 
     



    RBI guidelines.  The entire attempt is not to put forth the fair value 
    of shares.  M/s Sharp and Tannan based its valuation report on Net 
    Asset Value and profit earning capacity value.  Even these methods 





    do not comply with RBI circular of 2004.   Reliance of the letter 
    dated   19   February   2009   is   misplaced.     This   letter   from   Reserve 
    Bank of India is a routine letter which only directs that Company to 





    carry out transactions in terms of the circular. It is far-fetched to 
    suggest   that   the   RBI   itself   applied   its   mind   and   approved   the 
    valuation carried out treating it as a fair valuation.

    the   purpose   of   an   application  to  the  Controller of  Capital  Issues 




                                                            
    seeking its prior approval to price of new shares.  It did not require 
    valuation of the Company as a going concern.   No capital can be 




                                                           
    made therefore, on the ground that 1992 valuation was based on 
    CCI method.  The contention that NAV method was rightly followed 
    cannot be accepted as the VIRC reference manual which explains 




                                               
    the   NAV   method   shows   that   it   is   to   be   adopted   in   case   of 
                                   
    manufacturing   companies   where   fixed   assets   have   greater 
    relevance for earning revenues. Nothing is shown as to how this is 
                                  
    so and the Board therefore, has correctly rejected this contention. 
    There is no perversity in this finding.

    M/s Sharp and Tannan, it is the contention of Mr.De'Vitre that even 
    these guidelines have not been followed.  Para 7.3 of CCI guidelines 
    have been relied upon.  I have seen the guidelines.  The guidelines 





    state   that   though   past   profits   would   serve   as   indicator,   future 
    should   not   be   completely   ignored.   In   spite   of   this   position,   the 
    valuation is based on the earlier years and there is no projection for 





    future.  Even the time taken for assessing the average earning, the 
    years  in  which  there  is an  unusual variance  has to be  excluded. 
    The   year   2005   should   have   been   excluded   as   in   that   year   the 
    earning   was  `82,36,045   in   comparison   with   2004   where   it   was

    Nafan   group   agreed   that   fair   valuation   should   be   done   as   per 
                                   
    ', Article 17',  by the statutory auditor and the statutory auditor has 
                                  
    carried out the valuation; the Court will uphold the valuation.  This 
    argument   is   difficult   to   accept.     What   the   MOU   stated   was   the 
    parties   would   part   ways   on   fair   value   and   not   upon   valuation, 
        


    which is not fair. Can it be said that even if the valuation is arrived 
     



    at ignoring  well-established methods and it is at    `1, still Nafan 
    must accept the same since it agreed that a statutory auditor would 
    carry out the valuation. The proposition cannot be stretched to an 





    absurd limit.  Because a party agrees to a valuation by the statutory 
    auditor   it   does   not   mean   it   relinquish   all   the   rights.   Various 
    decisions   were   cited   at   the   bar   on   this   proposition   by 





    Mr.Dwarkadas, mostly of the English Court.   It is not necessary to

                by the petitioner to the valuation report. Mr. P.C. Khanna,  
                learned   senior   counsel   appearing   on   behalf   of   the  
                respondents, submitted that the valuer's report was binding

                While   computing   the   stake/share   of   the   petitioner   in   the  
                company the valuer acted as an expert and not as a quasi  
                arbitrator or an arbitrator. This being so his report cannot  




                                                  
                be attacked in the instant proceedings. The valuation given  
                by the valuer is final and conclusive between the parties. In  
                                   
                case the petitioner is aggrieved of the valuation determined  
                by the valuer, his remedy lies in filing a suit for damages  
                against   the   valuer   for   negligence.   Mr.   Khanna   canvassed  
                                  
                that   initially   the   view   of   the   English   courts   was   that   no  
                action   lay   against   the   experts   such   as   valuers,   auditors,  
                brokers   etc   in   tort   for   giving   an   opinion   or   making   a  
        

                determination negligently. This was on the ground that they  
                were   discharging   professional   duties   of   quasi   judicial  
     



                character.   Since   the   experts   could   not   be   sued,   their  
                determination could be impugned in the litigation between  
                the   parties   affected   by   their   determination   or   opinion.  
                Learned counsel further argued that the aforesaid principle  





                has  been  discarded in England and the position, as made  
                clear by the House of Lords, is that an expert can be sued for  
                damages   when   he   acts   negligently   in   performance   of   his  
                duties. In support of his submissions, Mr.Khanna relied on

                negligently in making his determination and can be sued for  





                tort or negligence but action against the valuer for damages  
                cannot come in the way when the court is considering the  
                validity of the valuation itself. The fact that the parties may  
                have agreed that the valuation arrived at by a valuer would  
                be binding on them, the agreement does not imply that they  
                will be bound even by a valuation which is erroneous. In this

                Khanna   contended   that   the   compromise   recorded   by   the  
                court   constitutes   a   decree   and   if   this   is   so   the   valuation

                compromise recorded by the court constitutes a decree but  
                that does not mean that the report of the valuer which was  
                directed to be filed under the order of this court cannot be  




                                                                
                touched in these proceedings. In case the report suffers from  
                mistake or perversity, the same can certainly be set aside in  
                these proceedings and the matter can be referred for fresh  
                valuation by an expert. The court is not bound to accept the  




                                                  
                report  in  case  the same is erroneous. Mr. Sanghi, learned

                senior counsel for the respondents, refuted this position and  
                submitted that the appointment of the valuer was made by  
                by   this   court   order   on   the   basis   of   the   terms   of   the  
        

                compromise arrived at between the parties and the same was  
                not made under Order 26 Rule 9 C.P.C. It is not necessary to  
     



                examine   the   submissions   of   the   learned   counsel   for   the

    Delhi   High   Court   has   concluded   that   not   all   the   principles   laid 
    down in the decisions of the English Court reflect the legal position 
    prevalent in India.   It held that an expert opinion does not enjoy 





    absolute   immunity   even   if   it   suffers   from   fundamental   mistake, 
    collusion, and fraud.   I respectfully agree with this view.   Even in 
    the cases relied upon by Mr.Dwarkadas, and which were considered 
    by the Delhi High Court, the Courts have kept the rider that the 
    valuers report does not enjoy absolute immunity.   In the present

                power is exercised by another. The authority concerned does  
                not apply its mind and take action on its own judgment,

    Sharp and Tannan produced a report in one day and then justified

    insisting  on  valuation  nothing is shown  on  record that  24 hours 
    valuation  was  insisted  upon. The learned counsel for the  parties

    technology   and   faster   processing   of   information   will   expedite 
    preparation of reports.   However, whether a valuer should produce 
                                  
    report in 24 hours, whether technology permits it to do so will have 
    to be assessed on facts of each case.   In the present case, there was 
    absolutely no need to prepare report in a hurry and to omit the 
        


    most relevant method.   Nafan has placed on record that they had 
     



    obtained   a   valuation   report   from   another   reputed   valuer,   which 
    shows the same shares as valued substantially higher.  According to 
    them, the correct valuation was about 25 million Euros at that time 





    while Sharp & Tannan valued the shareholding at approximately 27 
    crores only.  Thus, price of a majority stake in one of leading yeast

    be helped but observing that is the cost of two, three residential

    valuation   of   M/s   Sharp   and   Tannan   is   bad,   but   this   valuation

    immediate response to the valuation was that if that is the price of

    report was prepared and used by Muthu group, the finding of the 




                                               
    board that this conduct of the Muthu group is a part of oppressive 
                                   
    conduct,   cannot be termed as a perverse finding.         Considering 
    the facts on record as analyzed earlier, one is surely left with an 
                                  
    impression   that   something   was   seriously   amiss   the   way     the 
    valuation report was presented.  Had it been a stand-alone instance 
    of a mere valuation report presented for discussions, it would have 
        


    been a different matter.   The preparation of such valuation report 
     



    was a piece of much large picture and it fitted in the scheme of 
    things   perpetuated   by   Mr.Muthu.     The   preparation   of   such 
    valuation   report   through   M/s   Sharp   and   Tannan   completed   the 





    scheme of usurping the shares of Nafan.

    circumstances of the case, to discard the valuation report and make 
    the   observations  it   made.     M/s   Sharp   and   Tannan,   knowing  the 
    responsibility casts upon them and the consequences thereof, ought 
    to have been more careful and ought not to have prepared a report 
    on the basis completely different than the acceptable norms.   The 
    total   lack   of   explanation   as   to   why     there   was   need   to   prepare

    though   it   has   held   that   Nafan   succeeded   in   proving   the   case   of 
    oppression, concluded that the ultimate relief should be that Nafan 
        

    and Lesaffre must sell its shareholding to Muthu group.  The Board 
    concluded that two groups could not run the Company together as 
     



    the relations between the parties have become acrimonious.   The 
    Board   opined   that   the   permanent   solution   in   the   paramount 





    interest of SAF Yeast is sale of shares of one group to another.  The 
    Board thereafter considered the claim of both the parties as who 
    should buy out whom.  According to Nafan and Lesaffre, they are a 





    leading   business   group   worldwide   in   the   yeast   business.     They 
    supplied financial and technical support to SAF Yeast and they have 
    substantially contributed to its growth.   They also contended that 
    the title 'SAF Yeast' is derived from the word 'Lesaffre'.  A grievance 
    was   made   that   Muthu   group   caused   SAF   Yeast   to   file   criminal 
    complaints,   which   were   subsequently   withdrawn.   On   behalf   of

    would not get into the contentions of either parties regarding their 
    respective contribution, as it was a joint venture.   The Board held 
        


    that   the   joint   venture   was   for   commercial   purpose.   Lesaffre   and 
     



    SAF  Yeast  have   already received back their money with interest. 
    Nafan   and   Lesaffre   are   based   in   Netherlands   and   France 
    respectively and it is necessary that Indians are involved in running 





    the Company since it is in interior places in India, and the policy of 
    Indian  government  relating to foreign  investment  may not  allow 
    Nafan to acquire 100 per cent shareholding. It was held that Muthu 





    group   has   given   personal   guarantees.     The   action   taken   in   the 
    meetings was on legal advice and it was bonafide meeting, which 
    had to be hurriedly called in view of the meeting to be held in Paris 
    on  29  May 2009, and one aberration should not  be  a reason  to 
    severely reprimand any one.  Thereafter the Board directed buyout

    and Nafan to acquire 100 per cent shareholding.  Muthu group has

    Muthu group is directed to exit, they will have no other source of 
    livelihood.  If Lesaffre and Nafan are directed to exit, they will not

    held  that  two  groups  cannot  go together and parting of ways  is 





    imminent.   The   Board   has   also   rightly   discarded   the   rival 
    contentions of regarding contributions. SAF Yeast is a joint venture. 
    It   was   created   together.     Nafan   and   Lesaffre   held   51   per   cent 





    shareholding   and   Muthu   group   49   per   cent.     Nothing   stopped 
    Muthu group from establishing the Company on its own, yet the 
    Company was started as a joint venture. Nothing stopped Muthu 
    from establishing a unit on the technology stated to be available 
    with him, yet joint venture was formulated with Lesaffre who are 
    already in the business of manufacturing of yeast.  It was a mutual

    agreement and no party was coerced or forced to set up a joint 




                                                                                     
    venture.   Obviously   therefore,   it   was   set   up   for   mutual   benefit. 
    Nafan   and   Lesaffre   had   placed   on   record   their   stand   that   they 




                                                            
    wanted to set up a unit for manufacturing of yeast in India as they 
    saw potential in the market and in view of restrictions placed by 




                                                           
    the   Indian   government   they   had   to   start   it   in   a   joint   venture. 
    Therefore,   once     joint   venture   had   been   set   up   the   aspect   of 
    contribution does not assume so much of importance as rightly held 




                                               
    by the Board.  The Board however proceeded to hold that Lesaffre 
                                   
    and Nafan had already received their money back with interest as 
    against their investment in the form of shareholding.  I do not find 
                                  
    this approach to be correct. Lesaffre and Nafan are not investors. 
    They   were   51   per   cent   majority   shareholders   of   the   Company. 
    Thus, they were owners of the Company and not investors.   They 
        


    had   equal   interest   in   continuing  the   Company   and   it   was   not   a 
     



    mere loan transaction.  These also not mere finances but experts in 
    the production of yeast.

    oppression   rendered   against   Muthu   group   is   set     aside   and   the 
    appeal   of   Nafan   and   Lesaffre   are   dismissed,   then   the   order   to 





    buyout   under   ', Section   402',    cannot   be   disturbed.     He   has   further 
    contended that the entire case of Nafan and Lesaffre is that they 
    should be permitted to buyout because they are injured party and 
    majority shareholders.   He relied on the decision of the Calcutta 
    High   Court   in  ', Bajrang   Prasad   Jalan   v.   Mahabir   Jalan',  49    to

    be for the benefit of the Company.  He submitted that in the case of 
    Probir Kumar Misra  (supra), the Madras High Court had clearly 




                                                          
    relied   upon   underlying   intention   in   an   agreement   to   order   a

    group is willing to put an end to the litigation by having the shares 
    valued   by   an   independent   expert   and   thereby   completing   the 
    buyout process.  Therefore, the primary stand of the Muthu group 




                                              
    is that since there is no oppression by them there is no question of 
                                   
    any buyout of their shares and without prejudice, they are willing 
    to buyout the shares at the valuation fixed by this Court.

    regarding   oppression   by   Muthu   group   are   correct.   Therefore, 
        


    question is regarding the validity of the direction to order buyout in 
     



    favour of Muthu group even if they committed act of oppression. In 
    earlier paragraph, I have mentioned the grounds on which Board 
    has   ordered   buyout   of   the   shares   of   Nafan   and   Lesaffre.     The 





    grounds given by the Board as to why there should be a buyout of 
    the shares of Nafan and Lesaffre are on the face of it, erroneous. 
    The Board has stated that Muthu and his family will have no source 





    of livelihood.  The manner and  the level at which the litigation is 
    fought in the Board as well as in this Court and it will be nave to 
    assume that the family will be on streets.   Furthermore, if a buyout 
    is ordered, it is not that Muthu group will be thrown out on the 
    streets without any money. The buyout will be of the value of their

    shareholding, which will be substantial, and Muthu group will be 




                                                                                        
    free to carry on their business activities elsewhere or can always 
    invest it.   Even Mr.Dwarkadas has not contended that Muthu and 




                                                                
    his   family   will   be   on   the   streets.       The   next   reason   is   that   no 
    prejudice will be caused to Nafan and Lesaffre if they are directed 




                                                               
    exit because they are running various other companies worldwide. 
    If SAF Yeast was a joint venture in the area in which Nafan and 
    Lesaffre have expertise, they cannot be ordered to be exited from 




                                                 
    SAF   Yeast   simply   because   they   have   other   companies   in   other 
                                   
    developing countries.  In fact, it would strengthen the case of Nafan 
    and Lesaffre that they should be allowed to run the Company since 
                                  
    they have expertise and experience in running various companies in 
    other   developing   countries.    Then   the   Board   has  brought   in   the 
    intention of Nafan and Lesaffre while executing the MOU to order 
        


    the   buyout,   which   aspect   I   have   already   dealt   with.     Equally 
     



    untenable is the ground that since Nafan and Lesaffre are based in 
    Europe, it is better that an Indian runs the Company.   The joint 
    ventures between Indian entities with a foreign one now common.

',     Even though Nafan and Lesaffre are based outside India, they can 
    always have local nominee directors and such other staff who are 
    based in India. If buyout is to be ordered on this ground then most 





    of the joint ventures in India will be in serious peril.

    of   SAF   Yeast.     According   to   De   Vitre,   word   'SAF'   is   linked   to 
    Nafan/Lesaffre  continuing as a shareholder and in  case  Nafan is 
    ordered to exit, the Company will lose its name, which will result in 




                                               
    substantial loss of goodwill for SAF Yeast.   I find that in spite of 
                                   
    making the submission before the Board regarding loss of good will 
    by loss of name 'SAF', at the time of ordering buyout, the Board has 
                                  
    not referred to it at all.  In the Participation Agreement of the year 
    1991, the parties have agreed that SAF Yeast will use the term 'SAF' 
    only  with  the   consent   of Lesaffre  and Nafan and if the  share of 
        


    Nafan and Lesaffre drop below a particular limit,   the word 'SAF' 
     



    will be deleted.  It is the contention of Muthu group that the phrase 
    'SAF' is not derived from Lesaffre but from a Hindi term and it is 
    not much of importance.   However, the clause in the Participation 





    Agreement   cannot   be   ignored.     The   Board   has   also   noted   that 
    Lesaffre is a world leader in manufacturing of yeast.  Phonetically 
    SAF   does  seem  to   have  been  derived from Lesaffre.    The  name, 





    which indicates that SAF Yeast is a part of one of the world leaders 
    in the yeast business, will be no doubt create substantial goodwill.

    emphasized is that since Muthu has vast experience in the field of

    should be allowed to buy out the Nafan and Lesaffre.  However, this 




                                                           
    finding is contrary to the Board's own finding earlier that it is not 
    inclined   to   accept   contentions   of   either   parties   regarding   their 
    contribution as they had entered into joint venture for commercial

    allowed to  take  over the management, it may not be  capable of 
    handling the situation.  This is a rather simplistic view of the way 
                                  
    large scale industrial operations are run.   Merely because if Nafan 
    takes over the control, does not mean that it will terminate all the 
    existing   staff.     Professionals   manage   the   business   nowadays.

    staff can manage the day-to-day basis.     Though the expertise of 
    Muthu may not longer be available but that does not mean that 
    Nafan  and  Lesaffre   cannot    carry out affairs of the  Company by 





    employing competent professionals.   To my mind all the grounds

                the resolution of earlier meetings then those minutes stand  
                confirmed   irrespective   of   the   fact   that   the   appellants   had

                that several notices were given to the major shareholders of  
                the company at their local address in India knowing fully  
                well   that   both   the   appellants   are   NRIs.   The   outstanding  





                feature is that the appellant No. 2 ,Dr. Binod Prasad Sinha  
                has been shown as an NRI but notice to him was sent at the  
                address   P.O.   Hirapur,   District.   Dhanbad,   Bihar   and   those  
                notices   have   even   been   sent   with  very   short   interval.   The  
                meeting was convened on 13.4.1996 and the notice was sent  





                on 8.4.1996. Likewise, another meeting was scheduled to be  
                held on 5.9.1996 and the notice was sent on the very same  
                day i.e. 5.9.1996, the date of meeting was 2.12.1996 and  
                the notice was sent on 28.11.1996; the date of meeting was  
                12.3.1996   and   the   notice   was   sent   on   8.3.1996.   The  
                meeting was to be held on 27.3.1996 but the notice was sent  
                on   22.3.1996.   Apart   from   this,  it   was   known   to   the  
                respondent- Sajal Dutta who is the brother of appellant No.

                 Respondent No. 2 to somehow or the other oust his brother  




                                                                
                 from the majority shareholding.  Similarly, on the basis of  
                 such resolution, Dr. Binod Prasad Sinha, the appellant No. 2  
                 was ousted from the directorship under ', Section  283(1)(g)',  of  
                 the Act on the ground that he has not attended the meeting  




                                                               
                 and he has no interest whatsoever. Similarly, the appellant  
                 No. 1  was also ousted in the meeting which was held on  
                 7.2.1996   when   another   meeting   scheduled   to   be   held   on  
                 16.2.1996 and it was within the knowledge of Sajal Dutta  




                                                 
                 that his brother was likely to attend the meeting to be held  
                 on   16.2.1996.   But   suddenly   the   meeting   was   held   on  
                                   
                 7.2.1996 and the appellant No. 1 was stripped off his chair  
                 as   the   Managing   Director   of   the   company.   Hence,   Sajal  
                                  
                 Dutta became the Managing Director in place of Dr. Kamal  
                 Kumar   Dutta   and   the   minutes   of   the   said   meeting   dated  
                 7.2.1996   were   not   brought   forward   in   the   meeting   of  
                 16.2.1996 in which Dr. K.K. Dutta was present. The IDBI  
        

                 nominee reported to have advised that the draft minutes of  
                 the meeting dated 7.2.1996 to be placed before the meeting  
     



                 dated 16.2.1996 which would correctly reflect Sajal Dutta  
                 as   the   Managing   Director   but   it   was   not   included   in   the  
                 meeting   of   16.2.1996.   However,   Mr.   Nariman   tried   to  
                 persuade us to show that there was some defect in drafting  





                 of   minutes   of   the   resolution   and   therefore,   it   was   not  
                 reflected in the meeting dated 16.2.1996. It does not appeal  
                 to us.  Be that as it may, when such an important decision  
                 was   taken   in   the   absence   of   the   main   promoter   of   the  





                 company to oust him from the Managing Directorship and  
                 to install Sajal Dutta in his place, it is the   grossest act of

                 of the shares were cornered by the subsidiary companies of

    issued and shares were transferred at the valuation, which was not 
    acceptable   and   fundamentally   wrong.   This   is   not   a   onetime 




                                                
    aberration but a clear calculated act of grossest oppression.  It may 
                                   
    be that in the past notices were not given but never before stage of 
    exit in the company had arisen.  It was the most important decision 
                                  
    to be taken in the entire existence of the company.   After having 
    successfully gone through the plan of usurping the share holding of 
    a majority group, detailed justifications advanced to cover up the 
        


    conduct, which on the face of it, lacks in fairness. Taking law in 
     



    own hands cannot be termed as a normal human behaviour, as the 
    Board   has   observed.     If   this   is   tolerated,   it   will   create   serious 
    uncertainties for joint ventures and leads to complete lawlessness, 





    as   one   group   will   simply   transfer   share   holding   of   others   to 
    themselves without notice.

                guaranteed to be repaid to the Petitioner by the respondent  
     



                company. Respondent has resolutely refused to pay it back  
                inspite of assuring to do so many times earlier. Absolutely  
                nothing is placed on record to even hint that the Respondent  
                Company   does   not   owe   the   money   to   the   Petitioner.   Any  





                other   creditor   would   be   as   a   right   entitled   to   ask   for  
                admission of the petition against such a company. If so then  
                why   the   Petitioner   be   kept   away   from   this  right,  its  only  
                fault being that it lent the monies outside India and filed a  
                suit   for   recovery   of   the   same   in   the   Court   where   the  





                transaction   took   place.   To   deprive   the   Petitioner   will  
                encourage   Indian   companies   to   be   dishonest   in   their  
                international   dealings.  With   globalization   of   trade   and  
                investments, cross border flow of capital and the dependence  
                of   the   country's   economy   on   international   commerce,   the  
                company court needs to be alive to the changing commercial

    it   is   contended   that   their   civil   suit   is   pending   and   if   buyout   is 
    ordered in favour of Nafan now, then it would become 100 percent 
    shareholder of SAF Yeast. If later the suit is decreed in favour of 




                                                 
    Muthu   Group,   then   Muthu   Group   will   become   51   percent 
                                   
    shareholder and Nafan will be come 49 percent shareholder, which 
    is impracticable.   It was also contended that by this methodology 
                                  
    the   MOU   would   be   kept   aside.     I   am   not   impressed   by   these 
    submissions on behalf of Muthu Group. If the meetings were held 
    in legal, proper, and fair manner, Nafan and Lesaffre would have 
        


    put-forth  their  stand  on MOU that  they were  not ready.   Muthu 
     



    Group would in normal circumstances would have filed a civil suit 
    to   enforce   the   MOU.   Muthu   Group   would   have   sought   an 





    injunction against Nafan not to transfer the shareholding to anyone 
    else.  When Muthu Group apprehended coercive action on the part 
    of Nafan, they could had invoked jurisdiction of the Board and the 
    Board would have issued appropriate direction if case was made 





    out. The Muthu group did not take any such steps expected of a

',     146.   There is however one more aspect. I must also keep in mind 
    the interest of SAF Yeast.  If future uncertainties are avoided it will 




                                                 
    be good for SAF yeast. If future of SAF Yeast can be made litigation 
    free, then I will explore that option first. That option I will rank 
                                   
    higher that the right of Nafan for buyout at present. However, if 
                                  
    that is not being secured then right in favour of Nafan will have to 
    given effect to. I say so because after buyout is granted in favour of 
    Nafan,  litigation  will not end as the  will suit go on.   Nafan  has 
        


    shown that it is not averse to a competitive bid, though it is their 
     



    alternate submission. Therefore, if Muthu group withdraws the civil 
    suit and undertakes not to rely on the MOU, then the litigation can 
    be   put   an   end   to   by   a   bid.   Then   if   a   competitive   bid   is   held, 





    litigation   free   future   can   be   secured   for   SAF   yeast.   However,   if 
    Muthu group is not ready and this object is not being achieved then 
    buyout in favour of Nafan will have to follow.   I am, therefore, of 





    the   opinion   that,   before   ordering   a   buy-out   in   favour   of   Nafan, 
    possibility   of   a   forward   competitive   bid   be   explored.     That   way, 
    both the parties will make a competitive bid and one who will sell 
    out, will get a fair value.   It will also put an end to the litigation 
    once for all and a single group can then manage the company.  It 
    will   be   in   benefit   of   Nafan   also   as   the   bidding   will   take   place

    Lesaffre is maintainable. The petition filed by Nafan was rightly not 
    dismissed by the Board on the ground of suppression of facts. The 




                                                 
    declaration  given by the Board that MOU is valid, effective, and 
    enforceable   document   and   its   terms   are   binding,   cannot   be 
                                   
    sustained as it is beyond the jurisdiction of the Board, and needs to 
                                  
    be   agitated   in   the   suit,   which   is   pending.  Prima   facie,  no 
    unquestionable   intention   can   be   culled   out   from   the   MOU.   The 
    Board meetings held on 29 January 2009, 23 May 2009, and 25 
        


    May 2009 and the resolutions passed therein, are invalid, illegal, 
     



    and oppressive, so also the issuance of duplicate share certificates. 
    The   Board   has   rightly   discarded   the   valuation   report   and   the 
    reliance upon the same by Muthu Group is an act of oppression. 
', 




',     The comments made by the Board on the valuation report, were 
    justified.   The   direction   of   the   Board   to   Muthu   Group   to   rectify 
    register of SAF Yeast by restoring the shareholding of Nafan and 





    Lesaffre is valid and proper. The direction given by the Board to 
    Nafan and Lesaffre to transfer their shareholding to Muthu Group is 
    not   sustainable   and   has   to   be   set   aside.   Nafan   is   entitled   to   a 
    buyout   as   prayed   for   in   its   petition.   However,   it   will   be   in   the 
    interest of SAF yeast that the litigation ends and if Muthu group

    proceedings based on the MOU then the dispute can be put an end 
    to   by   holding  a  forward  competitive   bid.  If  Muthu  Group  is not
