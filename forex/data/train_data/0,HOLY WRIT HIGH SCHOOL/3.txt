	', I didn\u2019t set out to be a comma queen. The first job I ever had, the summer I was fifteen, was checking feet at a public pool in Cleveland. I was a \u201ckey girl\u201d\u2014\u201cKey personnel\u201d was the job title on my pay stub. I never knew what that was supposed to mean. I was not in charge of any keys, and my position was by no means crucial to the operation of the pool, although I did clean the bathrooms. Swimmers had to follow an elaborate ritual before getting into the pool: tuck your hair into a hideous bathing cap (if you were a girl), shower, wade through a footbath spiked with disinfectant that tinted your feet orange, and stand in line to have your toes checked. This took place at a special wooden bench, like those things that shoe salesmen use, except that instead of a miniature sliding board and a size stick for the customer\u2019s foot it had a stick with a foot-shaped platform on top. The prospective swimmer put one foot at a time on the platform and, leaning forward, used his fingers to spread out his toes so that the foot checker could make sure he didn\u2019t have athlete\u2019s foot. Only then could he pass into the pool. I have never heard of foot checkers in any city besides Cleveland.',  ', I am not particularly nostalgic about my foot-checking days. Nor do I wish to revisit my time at the Cleveland Costume Company, where I worked after graduation. I had gone to Douglass College, the women\u2019s college of Rutgers, in New Jersey, and returned ignominiously to Cleveland because I couldn\u2019t think of anything better to do. The costume company was fun for a while. I stuck it out through the Christmas season, and then I called a local dairy and asked whether there were any openings for milkmen.',  ', I had had a fantasy for years about owning a dairy farm. I liked cows: they led a placid yet productive life. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had a lady drive a milk truck, but there\u2019s no reason not,\u201d a man at the plant said. The route they gave me was in Fairview Park, a suburb west of Cleveland. The milk truck had two sets of pedals, one with the standard three for a stick shift, for driving sitting down when you were going long distances, and the other for driving standing up, when you were hopping between houses.',  ', I had half a mind to stay in Cleveland and try to marry the boss\u2019s son (he raised beef cattle), but I gave up the milk route to get a master\u2019s in English at the University of Vermont. One summer, I worked nights in a cheese factory, packaging mozzarella. A team of women, wearing white rubber aprons, yellow rubber gloves, green rubber boots, and hairnets, pulled bricks of mozzarella out of vats of cold salt water, labelled them, bagged them, sealed the bags, boxed the cheese, and stacked the boxes. I had a secret yen to operate the forklift truck. Also, while in graduate school, I started reading ', The New Yorker', .',  ', I sometimes visited one of my brothers, who lived in New York. He had gone to the Art Students League, where he made friends with a woman in his portrait class named Jeanne Fleischmann. She was married to Peter Fleischmann, the chairman of the board of ', The New Yorker', . His father, Raoul Fleischmann, had been the co-founder of the magazine, with Harold Ross. On one visit, I picked up a copy of the magazine. It was dated February 24, 1975. Eustace Tilley was on the cover, and the contents included a piece by E. B. White: \u201cLetter from the East.\u201d It was the anniversary issue\u2014', The New Yorker', \u2019', s',  fiftieth.',  ', Eventually, I met the Fleischmanns. I was doing research for my master\u2019s thesis, on James Thurber, and while Peter was away on business he let me sit in his office and look through bound volumes of the magazine. At the Morgan Library, in an exhibit of books that had belonged to writers, I found a grammar mistake on the wall label accompanying Thurber\u2019s copy of Hemingway\u2019s \u201cGreen Hills of Africa,\u201d in which he had made pencil drawings of Papa and Memsahib on safari. I was given permission to examine the book. (I made freehand copies of the illustrations and appended them to my thesis. My examiners were not amused.) In Vermont, I kept two stacks of magazines on my lobster-crate coffee table, one of ', Hoard\u2019s Dairyman ', and one of ', The New Yorker', .',  ', I made up my mind to move to New York in the fall of 1977. I drove there in my old Plymouth, with my cat, my books pared down to the bare essentials, and two hundred dollars. The Fleischmanns, whose grown children had moved out, were still in parental mode, and they befriended me readily. I spent many a cocktail hour in their den, drinking their Heineken and listening to Peter\u2019s stories. Peter drank Scotch-and-water, chain-smoked, and swallowed Maalox by the handful. He told war stories (he was in the Battle of the Bulge) and stories about Yale and about his father, Raoul (the family came from Austria), and croquet games with Harpo Marx making an impossible shot by sawing up a tire and wrapping it around a tree trunk.',  ', That fall, I had a reverse commute from the financial district to Paterson, New Jersey, where I was washing dishes in a friend\u2019s restaurant. The friend paid my bus fare and gave me all the beer I could drink. In return, I tried not to throw away the silverware when I scraped the dishes. Often, I got off the bus on the way home and walked over the George Washington Bridge. I worked on my thesis, and sometimes despaired. Peter pointed out that even if I never finished the thesis or got the master\u2019s degree, it was no reason to despair. Peter had no influence in the editorial department\u2014like his father, he kept business and editorial strictly separate. But he offered to call Robert Bingham, the executive editor, and ask him to talk with me. We met, and Bingham was very nice, but there were no openings.',  ', I quit the dishwashing job and worked as a cashier at Korvettes during the Christmas rush. I could not figure out whether to be sad or relieved when the management did not recognize my talent and keep me on. I did temp work. I was on the verge of trying to get a hack license so that I could drive a cab when Peter, possibly sensing an ambulance in my future, suggested that I give Bingham a follow-up call.',  ', There was an opening! Two, in fact, one in the typing pool and one in the editorial library. I flunked the test for the typing pool. It was on an electric typewriter, and I was used to a manual\u2014at least, that was my excuse. If my hands trembled over the keyboard, the typewriter took off without me. The other interview went better. Once I got a whiff of the library\u2014that bookish, dusty, paste-and-paper smell so peculiar to libraries\u2014I felt that I was in my element. Helen Stark, who was only the second person ever to be in charge of the library, had a noble head\u2014you could see her profile on a coin\u2014and strong features. She and three girls sat at desks that faced each other in a cloverleaf arrangement. Helen gave me a typing test\u2014on a manual typewriter, cramming words onto an index card (I aced it)\u2014and borrowed an empty office for the interview. I remember her arranging her skirt, which was black and wide at the hem, when she crossed her legs. (My skirt was a forest-green Danskin wraparound that a friend had picked up at a thrift shop in New Jersey, and I didn\u2019t realize until the next time I wore it that one end of the hem hung some eight inches longer than the other.) I was all aglow, and Helen warned me that it was not a glamorous job. But she knew from experience that nothing she said could dim my enthusiasm or overturn my conviction that I would soon be one of the \u201cyoung friends\u201d whose \u201cletters\u201d were published in The Talk of the Town.',  ', I started work on Monday, typing summaries of the fiction in that week\u2019s issue and indexing it under key words. As Helen and I were leaving that night, an editor named Pat Crow got on the elevator at the eighteenth floor with us. I noticed his boots\u2014big mud-green rubber boots\u2014and said, \u201cThose are the kind of boots we wore in the cheese factory.\u201d He looked at Helen and said, \u201cSo this is the next stop after the cheese factory?\u201d',  ', Eventually, I became what was known as a collator\u2014a Bartleby-like occupation that computers have since done away with. In collating, you used a pencil to carefully transfer changes from various proofs from the editor, the author, the proofreaders (usually two), the lawyer, and the fact checker onto a clean proof for the printer. It was not a job I was born for: it demanded legible handwriting, and my penmanship had been deteriorating since third grade. But you learned how the place ran: collating was the nexus, it was where everything came together.',  ', The big challenge in collating was what were called Gould proofs. Eleanor Gould was ', The New Yorker', \u2019', s',  head grammarian and query proofreader. She was a certified genius\u2014a member not just of Mensa but of some übergroup within Mensa\u2014and the magazine\u2019s editor-in-chief at the time, William Shawn, had complete faith in her. She read everything in galley\u2014everything except fiction, that is, which she had been taken off of years earlier, as I understood it, because she treated everyone the same, be it Marcel Proust or Annie Proulx or Vladimir Nabokov. Clarity was Eleanor\u2019s lodestar, \u201cFowler\u2019s Modern English\u201d her bible, and by the time she was done with a proof the pencil lines on it looked like dreadlocks. Some of the fact pieces were ninety columns long, and Mr. Shawn took every query. My all-time favorite Eleanor Gould query was on Christmas Gifts for Children: the writer had repeated the old saw that every Raggedy Ann doll has \u201cI love you\u201d written on her little wooden heart, and Eleanor wrote in the margin that it did not, and she knew, because as a child she had performed open-heart surgery on her rag doll and seen with her own eyes that nothing was written on the heart.',  ', Then I was allowed to work on the copydesk. It changed the way I read prose\u2014I was paid to find mistakes, and it was a long time before I could once again read for pleasure. I spontaneously copy-edited everything I laid eyes on. I had a paperback edition of Faulkner\u2019s \u201cThe Hamlet\u201d that was so riddled with typos that it almost ruined Flem Snopes for me. But, as I relaxed on the copydesk, I was sometimes even able to enjoy myself. There were writers who weren\u2019t very good and yet were impossible to improve, like figure skaters who hit all the technical marks but have a limited artistic appeal and sport unflattering costumes. There were competent writers on interesting subjects who were just careless enough in their spelling and punctuation to keep a girl occupied. And there were writers whose prose came in so highly polished that I couldn\u2019t believe I was getting paid to read them: John Updike, Pauline Kael, Mark Singer, Ian Frazier! In a way, these were the hardest, because the prose lulled me into complacency. They transcended the office of the copy editor. It was hard to stay alert for opportunities to meddle in an immaculate manuscript, yet if you missed something you couldn\u2019t use that as an excuse. The only thing to do was style the spelling, and even that could be fraught. Oliver Sacks turned out to be attached to the spelling of \u201csulphur\u201d and \u201csulphuric\u201d that he remembered from his chemistry experiments as a boy. (', The New Yorker',  spells it less romantically: \u201csulfur,\u201d \u201csulfuric.\u201d)',  ', When Pauline Kael typed \u201cprevert\u201d instead of \u201cpervert,\u201d she meant \u201cprevert\u201d (unless she was reviewing something by Jacques Prévert). Luckily, she was kind, and if you changed it she would just change it back and stet it without upbraiding you. Kael revised up until closing, and though we lackeys resented writers who kept changing \u201cdoughnut\u201d to \u201ccoffee cake\u201d then back to \u201cdoughnut\u201d and then \u201ccoffee cake\u201d again, because it meant more work for us, Kael\u2019s changes were always improvements. She approached me once with a proof in her hand. She couldn\u2019t figure out how to fix something, and I was the only one around. She knew me from chatting in the ladies\u2019 room on the eighteenth floor. I looked at the proof and made a suggestion, and she was delighted. \u201cYou helped me!\u201d she gasped.',  ', I was on the copydesk when John McPhee\u2019s pieces on geology were set up. I tried to keep my head. There was not much to do. McPhee was like John Updike, in that he turned in immaculate copy. Really, all I had to do was read. I\u2019d heard that McPhee compared his manuscript with the galleys, so anything ', The New Yorker',  did he noticed. I just looked up words in the dictionary to check the spelling (which was invariably correct, but I had to check) and determined whether compound words were hyphenated, whether hyphenated words should be closed up or printed as two words, or whether I should stet the hyphen. It was my province to capitalize the \u201ci\u201d in Interstate 80, hyphenate I-80, and lowercase \u201cthe interstate.\u201d',  ', In Part II of \u201cIn Suspect Terrain,\u201d I came to this sentence and thought I might have spotted an error: \u201cBut rock columns are generalized; they are atremble with hiatuses; and they depend in large part on well borings, which are shallow, and on seismic studies, which are new, and far between.\u201d The itchy-fingered copy editor hovered at the threshold. I wanted to let her in. I wasn\u2019t going to touch the comma, but I was desperate to correct that \u201cnew, and far between\u201d to \u201cfew, and far between.\u201d I could save McPhee from making a horrible mistake! But many people with finer minds than mine were lined up to read the copy when I was through. They would not assume that \u201cnew\u201d was a typo for \u201cfew,\u201d and if they had any doubt they could query it, asking the author through his editor, and there would be no harm done. But I was hellbent on rectifying what might be a glitch in a cliché. It was a Friday\u2014I remember, because I knew that if I made this change I would have to live all weekend with the possibility, which could swiftly morph into a certainty, that I had made a mistake. Two mistakes: I would have gone beyond my province, and I would have introduced an error into McPhee\u2019s carefully wrought prose.',  ', So I stayed my hand, the itchy-fingered hand with the pencil in it, and spent the weekend with a clean conscience. As soon as I left the office, I felt relieved that I had let it alone. What ever made me think that McPhee would misspell, or even mistype, the word \u201cfew\u201d?',  ', That was more than thirty years ago. And it has now been more than twenty years since I became a page O.K.\u2019er\u2014a position that exists only at ', The New Yorker', , where you query-proofread pieces and manage them, with the editor, the author, a fact checker, and a second proofreader, until they go to press. An editor once called us prose goddesses; another job description might be comma queen. Except for writing, I have never seriously considered doing anything else.',  ', One of the things I like about my job is that it draws on the entire person: not just your knowledge of grammar and punctuation and usage and foreign languages and literature but also your experience of travel, gardening, shipping, singing, plumbing, Catholicism, Midwesternism, mozzarella, the A train, New Jersey. And in turn it feeds you more experience. The popular image of the copy editor is of someone who favors rigid consistency. I don\u2019t usually think of myself that way. But, when pressed, I do find I have strong views about commas.',  ', The comma as we know it was invented by Aldo Manuzio, a printer working in Venice, circa 1500. It was intended to prevent confusion by separating things. In the Greek, ', komma',  means \u201csomething cut off,\u201d a segment. (Aldo was printing Greek classics during the High Renaissance. The comma was a Renaissance invention.) As the comma proliferated, it started generating confusion. Basically, there are two schools of thought: One plays by ear, using the comma to mark a pause, like dynamics in music; if you were reading aloud, the comma would suggest when to take a breath. The other uses punctuation to clarify the meaning of a sentence by illuminating its underlying structure. Each school believes that the other gets carried away. It can be tense and kind of silly, like the argument among theologians about how many angels can fit on the head of a pin. How many commas can fit into a sentence by Herman Melville? Or, closer to home, into a sentence from ', The New Yorker', ?',  ', Even something as ostensibly simple as the serial comma can arouse strong feelings. The serial comma is the one before \u201cand\u201d in a series of three or more things. With the serial comma: My favorite cereals are Cheerios, Raisin Bran, and Shredded Wheat. Without the serial comma: I used to like Kix, Trix and Wheat Chex. Proponents of the serial comma say that it is preferable because it prevents ambiguity, and I\u2019ll go along with that. Also, I\u2019m lazy, and I find it easier to use the serial comma consistently rather than stop every time I come to a series and register whether or not the comma before the \u201cand\u201d preceding the last item is actually preventing ambiguity. But pressed to come up with an example of a series that was unambiguously ambiguous without the serial comma I couldn\u2019t think of a good one. An ambiguous series proved so elusive that I wondered whether perhaps we could do without the serial comma after all. In my office, this is heresy, but I will say it anyway and risk being shunned in the elevator: Isn\u2019t the \u201cand\u201d sufficient? After all, that\u2019s what the other commas in a series stand for: \u201cLions and tigers and bears, oh my!\u201d A comma preceding \u201cand\u201d is redundant. I was at risk of becoming a comma apostate.',  ', Fortunately, the Internet is busy with examples of series that are absurd without the serial comma:',  ', \u201cWe invited the strippers, J.F.K. and Stalin.\u201d (This has been illustrated online, and formed the basis of a poll: which stripper had the better outfit, J.F.K. or Stalin.)',  ', \u201cThis book is dedicated to my parents, Ayn Rand and God.\u201d',  ', And there was the country-and-Western singer who was joined onstage by his two ex-wives, Kris Kristofferson and Waylon Jennings.',  ', \u201cWho\u2019s God?\u201d',      ', Share',  ', Tweet',  ',  ', Buy a cartoon',  ',    ', The bottom line is to choose one and be consistent and try not to make a moral issue out of it. Or is it? Maybe it\u2019s better to judge each series on its merits, applying the serial comma where it\u2019s needed and suppressing it where it\u2019s not. Many newspapers, both American and British, do not use the serial comma, which underscores the idea that the news is meant to be read fast, in the dead-tree version or on the screen, because it\u2019s not news for long. It\u2019s ephemeral. Print\u2014or, rather, text\u2014should be streamlined and unencumbered. Maybe the day is coming when the newsfeed-style three dots (ellipsis) between items, like the eternal ribbon of news circling the building at One Times Square, will dominate, and all text will look like Céline. Certainly advertising\u2014billboards, road signs, neon\u2014repels punctuation. Leaving out the serial comma saves time and space. The editors of Webster\u2019s Third saved eighty pages by cutting down on commas.',  ', But suppose you\u2019re not in a hurry. Suppose you move your lips when you read, or pronounce every word aloud in your head, and you\u2019re reading a Victorian novel or a history of Venice. You have plenty of time to crunch commas. If I worked for a publication that did not use the serial comma, I would adjust\u2014convert from orthodox to reformed\u2014but for now I remain loyal to the serial comma, because it actually does sometimes prevent ambiguity and because I\u2019ve gotten used to the way it looks. It gives starch to the prose, and can be very effective. If a sentence were a picket fence, the serial commas would be posts at regular intervals.',  ', The term \u201cOxford comma\u201d refers to the Oxford University Press, whose house style is to use the serial comma. (The public-relations department at Oxford doesn\u2019t insist on it, however. Presumably P.R. people see it as a waste of time and space. The serial comma is a pawn in the war between town and gown.) To call it the Oxford comma gives it a bit of class, a little snob appeal. Chances are that if you use the Oxford comma you brush the crumbs off your shirtfront before going out.',  ', There is a fancy word for \u201cgoing beyond your province\u201d: \u201cultracrepidate.\u201d So much of copy editing is about not going beyond your province. Anti-ultracrepidationism. Writers might think we\u2019re applying rules and sticking it to their prose in order to make it fit some standard, but just as often we\u2019re backing off, making exceptions, or at least trying to find a balance between doing too much and doing too little. A lot of the decisions you have to make as a copy editor are subjective. For instance, an issue that comes up all the time, whether to use \u201cthat\u201d or \u201cwhich,\u201d depends on what the writer means. It\u2019s interpretive, not mechanical\u2014though the answer often boils down to an implicit understanding of commas.',  ', Think of the great Dylan Thomas line \u201cThe force that through the green fuse drives the flower.\u201d It\u2019s a bit unfair to consider this as an example, because (1) it\u2019s poetry, and we can\u2019t all write (or drink) like Dylan Thomas, and (2) nobody remembers what comes next. It goes like this: \u201cThe force that through the green fuse drives the flower / Drives my green age.\u201d A gorgeous line. Although it is verse, and quoting any more of it would confuse the issue, it nevertheless passes the test for determining whether to use \u201cthat\u201d or \u201cwhich\u201d: if the phrase or clause introduced by a relative pronoun\u2014\u201cthat\u201d or \u201cwhich\u201d\u2014is essential to the meaning of the sentence, \u201cthat\u201d is preferred, and it is not separated from its antecedent by a comma. Maybe some inferior poet would write, \u201cThe force which through the green fuse drives the flower\u201d (the audience at his reading would snort), or, worse, \u201cThe force, which through the green fuse drives the flower, / Drives my green age\u201d (this writer would never make it into print, unless he hired a good copy editor). \u201cThe force\u201d has no meaning without \u201cthat through the green fuse.\u201d Take it away and you are left with \u201cThe force . . . drives my green age,\u201d leaving you to wonder, What force? Are we watching \u201cStar Wars\u201d? \u201cMay the Force, which through the green fuse drives the flower, be with you.\u201d I can hear Bill Murray saying this, but not Dylan Thomas or Han Solo.',  ', The New Yorker',  practices a \u201cclose\u201d style of punctuation. Or, as E. B. White once put it, \u201cCommas in ', The New Yorker',  fall with the precision of knives in a circus act, outlining the victim.\u201d If the sentence has an introductory clause (like this one), we separate it with a comma. But if the introductory clause follows a conjunction we don\u2019t. We do make exceptions for \u201csince\u201d or \u201calthough.\u201d If the meaning of the introductory clause is restrictive we don\u2019t use the comma. A restrictive clause does not want to be separate from what it modifies: it wants to be one with it, to be essential to it, to identify with it totally. (She was a graduate of a school that had very high standards.) Everything else is nonrestrictive. (He graduated from another school, which would admit anyone with a pulse.)',  ', It\u2019s not always easy to decide what\u2019s restrictive. That\u2019s where judgment comes in. For instance, here is a sentence, chock-full of commas, from this magazine, that was quoted by Ben Yagoda in an online article for the ', Times:',  \u201cBefore Atwater died, of brain cancer, in 1991, he expressed regret.\u201d Yagoda wrote, \u201cNo other publication would put a comma after \u2018died\u2019 or \u2018cancer.\u2019 ', The New Yorker',  does so because otherwise (or so the thinking goes), the sentence would suggest that Atwater died multiple times and of multiple causes.\u201d He added, \u201cThat is nutty, of course.\u201d The ', Times', \u2014along with Yagoda, who teaches journalism\u2014prefers an \u201copen\u201d style of punctuation, where the words stream together and every phrase or clause is of equal moment, leaving the reader to figure it out. Some readers are especially proud of their ability to figure it out and like to write letters of complaint and, put, a, comma, after, every, word, to show us the error of our ways.',  ', Secretly, I wondered if I agreed with Yagoda. Once, when I was collating a Gould proof, I had the unsettling thought \u201cWhat if Eleanor ever loses it?\u201d What if all these commas and hyphens and subtleties of usage prove to be the products of a benign delusion? That was during the Reagan Administration, when many of us suspected that Reagan had some form of dementia, but no one could do anything about it. The country was running on automatic. What if that was the case with Eleanor and ', The New Yorker', ? She was getting old, and she went deaf in her later years, so she was tragically isolated from the sounds of speech that were represented in the words she groomed. There was not a single thing anyone would be able to do about it. No one would enter the copy department and say to Eleanor, \u201cDrop the pencil and step away from the desk.\u201d We were in her thrall, as the nation was in Reagan\u2019s thrall. I jumped up and went to a colleague\u2019s office and said, \u201cWhat if Eleanor goes crazy?\u201d From the expression on her face\u2014\u201cYou\u2019re only figuring this out now?\u201d\u2014I knew that we were all well advanced down the path.',  ', Having been teased in the ', Times',  about ', New Yorker',  commas, I took a good, hard look at the magazine\u2019s policy, and I persuaded myself that in fact these commas were not indiscriminate. They marked off segments of the sentence that were not germane to the meaning. The point of the sentence Yagoda had chosen for mild ridicule, as I pointed out in an online response, is that Atwater expressed regret before he died. What he died of and when he died of it are both extra details that the author, Jane Mayer, provides only to satisfy the reader\u2019s curiosity. They aren\u2019t essential to the meaning of the sentence. They are nonrestrictive.',  ', A while later, a reader wrote in objecting to the commas in this opening sentence of a piece by Marc Fisher: \u201cWhen I was in high school, at Horace Mann, in the Bronx, in the nineteen-seventies, everyone took pride in the brilliant eccentricity of our teachers.\u201d The gist of that sentence is that at Horace Mann students enjoyed interacting with their crazy teachers. But if all you see when you read it is the commas, you miss that. Close punctuation is not meant as a guide to stops and starts, like Dickens\u2019s and Melville\u2019s commas. ', The New Yorker',  isn\u2019t asking you to pause and gasp for breath at every comma. That\u2019s not what close punctuation is about. The commas are marking a thoughtful subordination of information. I really don\u2019t see how any of them could be done without. The writer went to only one high school, a very special, one-of-a-kind private school that happened to be in the Bronx, and the time that he went there was the nineteen-seventies. None of that is particularly interesting except in the context of a piece that promises to be about the bond between students and teachers. The punctuation is almost like Braille, providing a kind of bas-relief, accentuating the topography of the sentence. It looks choppy, but you don\u2019t have to chop it up when you read it. It is Aldo Manuzio\u2019s comma taken to its logical extreme. It\u2019s not insane\u2014it\u2019s not even nutty. It\u2019s just showing what\u2019s important in the sentence in a subtle way. Another publication would let you figure it out for yourself. And, if that\u2019s what you want, you can always read some other magazine.',  ', In the summer of 2013, in New Haven, where I had gone for the wedding of a friend, I picked up a copy of \u201cLight Years,\u201d by James Salter. I started it in an old hotel, the Duncan, feeling slightly sad that I had never gotten to go to Yale.',  ', \u201cLight Years\u201d is about a marriage, its surface\u2014an enviable round of dinner parties and indulgent Christmas projects (the daughters of the house actually have a pony) in a picture-postcard setting within commuting distance of Manhattan\u2014and its coming apart from underneath. James Salter is a pen name; the writer\u2019s name is James Horowitz. His other novels include \u201cA Sport and a Pastime\u201d and \u201cAll That Is.\u201d ', The New Yorker',  staff writer Nick Paumgarten had recently written a long piece about him, and there was so much buzz about it in the office that I read it on my own time.',  ', This was my first taste of James Salter himself, and his prose is exquisite, so well groomed that I was surprised to come to a sentence with what I considered a superfluous comma: \u201cEve was across the room in a thin, burgundy dress that showed the faint outline of her stomach.\u201d It stopped me. Usage guides say that if you can substitute \u201cand\u201d for the comma it belongs there. I gave James Salter the \u201cand\u201d test, and \u201cthin and burgundy\u201d did not pass. If this had crossed my desk, I would have taken the comma out and made it \u201ca thin burgundy dress.\u201d',  ', The logic behind this rule is that the two adjectives are not coördinate: they do not belong to the same order. One adjective (\u201cburgundy\u201d) clings more tenaciously to the noun (\u201cdress\u201d) than the other (\u201cthin\u201d). Bryan Garner, the expert in American usage, offers another test: reverse the order of the adjectives. Would you ever say \u201ca burgundy, thin dress\u201d? I wouldn\u2019t.',  ', I wondered whether this was the author\u2019s comma or whether it had slipped past the copy editor. I doubted that it was something a copy editor would add. This edition of \u201cLight Years\u201d was typographically flawless. Was it possible that the comma was retained at the author\u2019s insistence? Consider the context: \u201cEve was across the room in a thin, burgundy dress that showed the faint outline of her stomach.\u201d Was the author trying to emphasize the thinness of the fabric in order to linger over the \u201cfaint outline\u201d of her stomach? If so, I thought he was misguided, not to say lecherous. (Her name is Eve: she\u2019s obviously a temptress.) But was I going to let a superfluous comma prevent me from enjoying a good read? It didn\u2019t stop me in Dickens, and it wouldn\u2019t stop me in Salter. I persisted.',  ', I was not completely impartial. \u201cLight Years\u201d had an introduction by Richard Ford, whose work I once tried to take a comma out of. The offending comma followed the word \u201cSo\u201d at the beginning of a line of dialogue, and Ford preferred to retain it. The choice of Richard Ford for the introduction suggested to me that James Salter, like Richard Ford, might be stubborn about his punctuation. He might be one of the \u201cear\u201d guys, the ones who think they have to orchestrate each sentence.',  ', Then it happened again: \u201cShe smiled that stunning, wide smile.\u201d The phrase \u201cstunning and wide\u201d doesn\u2019t make it for me, and neither does \u201cwide and stunning\u201d (although I would have read right over \u201cwide, stunning smile\u201d). The narrator has already remarked on the wideness of the character\u2019s smile (hence the \u201cthat\u201d in \u201cthat stunning, wide smile\u201d) and is intensifying its attractiveness at the second reference. \u201cStunning\u201d qualifies the wide smile. Adjectives not coördinate. No comma.',  ', Again: \u201cIt was as if they were aboard ship: some old, island steamer.\u201d An \u201cisland steamer\u201d is a kind of boat. There is no danger of someone\u2019s misreading the phrase as a steamer from \u201csome old island.\u201d',  ', And another nautical reference: \u201cThe ship was enormous . . . the vastness of its black, stained side overwhelmed them.\u201d This comma seems to be trying to repel a hyphen hovering between \u201cblack\u201d and \u201cstained.\u201d It is not a \u201cblack-stained side\u201d but a black side, stained: a black stained side.',  ', It\u2019s not that these four extraneous (to my ear) commas diminished my enjoyment of the book, but I did stop and wonder where they came from, the author or the editor, and whether there was any discussion about them. James Salter clearly has a sharp ear and a fine eye. His pen name evokes the word \u201cpsalter\u201d while suggesting earthiness. In doing without a hyphen in the title \u201cLight Years\u201d (Webster\u2019s spells it \u201clight-year\u201d), he cubes the meaning: carefree years, seen from an astronomical distance. Just for balance, here is one of his finest commas: \u201cHe sailed on the ', France',  in the noisy, sad afternoon.\u201d Sad and noisy, noisy and sad. \u201cNoisy\u201d is especially effective because it evokes \u201cnausea,\u201d from the Greek for \u201cseasickness.\u201d Could a writer so sensitive to language have a thing for kinky punctuation?',  ', It was enough to make me doubt my comma sense. Some days, \u201cthin and burgundy\u201d sounded just fine. At work, coming to the phrase \u201ca stout, middle-aged woman,\u201d I automatically started to pluck the comma out and then became unsure. \u201cStout and middle-aged\u201d? I don\u2019t think so. \u201cMiddle-aged and stout\u201d? Definitely not. Wasn\u2019t it the same as \u201ca fat old lady\u201d? \u201cFat and old\u201d? \u201cOld and fat\u201d? An old fat lady? \u201cAn old fat lady\u201d suggests that the fat lady in the circus is being hounded out of her job by an ambitious new fat lady, at which point she will become just another fat old lady. I was driving myself mad.',  ', I decided to write to James Salter and ask him about his commas. He wrote back:',  ', \u201cI sometimes ignore the rules about commas although generally I follow convention and adhere to the advice in Strunk and White. Punctuation is for clarity and also emphasis, but I also feel that, if the writing warrants it, punctuation can contribute to the music and rhythm of the sentences. You don\u2019t get permission for this, of course; you take the liberty.\u201d',  ', When a writer who is not a poet invokes rhythm, copy editors often exchange looks. But Salter went on to describe the reasoning behind each of the commas in question. As I had suspected, with the comma in \u201cEve was across the room in a thin, burgundy dress that showed the faint outline of her stomach,\u201d he was trying to emphasize the contours of the stomach under the dress. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a thin burgundy dress,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt was a thin dress, burgundy in color. I wanted the reader to be aware of the thinness. So you are right. The copy editor probably marked out the comma, and I wrote stet.\u201d He was doing the same thing with \u201cstunning, wide smile,\u201d trying to control the impact of the \u201cstunning\u201d by smacking it with a comma as one would put English on a cue ball. Of my next example, he wrote, \u201cI suppose that there\u2019s no chance of a reader thinking it\u2019s an old island, but I felt an instant of hesitation about old and island as I read the words and wanted to eliminate that.\u201d For this reader, the comma added rather than eliminated the hesitation. As for the last, he wrote, \u201cI think black stained side is too loose. It\u2019s not, as you say, black-stained, but black and also stained. The comma fixes that.\u201d Though Manuzio invented the comma in order to separate parts of a sentence, it can tie words together as efficiently as it keeps them apart.',  ', Some would scoff at these explanations, but I am grateful for them, even if Salter does have some untoward ideas about what you can do with commas and imputes to them a power that verges on magic. The writer is not always the best judge of his own effects, but at least he\u2019s thinking about them. The comma does not fix everything. Sometimes it gets in the way. Salter ended his letter with a recommendation for further reading: \u201cThe commas are better in \u2018A Sport and a Pastime.\u2019 \u201d',  ', While in graduate school in Vermont, I decided I should learn how cars worked. I wanted to be self-reliant. I drove a \u201965 Plymouth Fury II, in dark blue-green. It had a huge expanse of windshield, which was great for scenic drives and winter sunsets, and a V-8 engine, which meant nothing to me. I knew how to pump gas and check the oil and change a flat tire, but that was about it. My father, a fireman, had discouraged me from learning anything about the workings of the internal-combustion engine. When I said I wanted to learn how cars worked, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s easy. I\u2019ll tell you everything you need to know. You put the key in the ignition and you turn it.\u201d',  ', Thanks, Dad. To his credit, he had also advised me to cultivate a mechanic at a local gas station. But out in the Vermont countryside there were no gas stations\u2014just a pump at Marble\u2019s Store, where you could leave the keys in the car and Marble would move it if it was in the way. So I registered for an adult-education class in auto mechanics one night a week at the local high school. On the first night, the auto-mechanics teacher used a word I had never understood the meaning of: \u201cgasket.\u201d I had blown one once, on a friend\u2019s car, driving too fast on hair-raising canyon roads in Utah, and I knew that it cost a lot to replace, and the car was never the same. (Sorry!) Now, at last, I was going to find out what a gasket was. So I raised my hand and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s a gasket?\u201d The teacher, who looked like a used-car salesman, defined \u201cgasket\u201d by using three other words that I didn\u2019t know the meaning of: \u201ccrankcase,\u201d \u201cpistons,\u201d \u201ccarburetor.\u201d I\u2019m still not sure what a gasket is.',  ', Grammar also has some intimidating terms, and grammarians throw them around constantly, but you don\u2019t need to know them in order to use the language. E. B. White once said that before working on \u201cThe Elements of Style\u201d he was the kind of writer who did not have \u201cany exact notion of what is taking place under the hood.\u201d You notice a gasket only when someone blows it. To understand how the language works, though\u2014to master the mechanics of it\u2014you have to roll up your sleeves and join the ink-stained wretches as we name the parts. But if that doesn\u2019t work for you, just put the key in the ignition and turn it. ', \u2666',  			',

	', I didn\u2019t set out to be a comma queen. The first job I ever had, the summer I was fifteen, was checking feet at a public pool in Cleveland. I was a \u201ckey girl\u201d\u2014\u201cKey personnel\u201d was the job title on my pay stub. I never knew what that was supposed to mean. I was not in charge of any keys, and my position was by no means crucial to the operation of the pool, although I did clean the bathrooms. Swimmers had to follow an elaborate ritual before getting into the pool: tuck your hair into a hideous bathing cap (if you were a girl), shower, wade through a footbath spiked with disinfectant that tinted your feet orange, and stand in line to have your toes checked. This took place at a special wooden bench, like those things that shoe salesmen use, except that instead of a miniature sliding board and a size stick for the customer\u2019s foot it had a stick with a foot-shaped platform on top. The prospective swimmer put one foot at a time on the platform and, leaning forward, used his fingers to spread out his toes so that the foot checker could make sure he didn\u2019t have athlete\u2019s foot. Only then could he pass into the pool. I have never heard of foot checkers in any city besides Cleveland.',  ', I am not particularly nostalgic about my foot-checking days. Nor do I wish to revisit my time at the Cleveland Costume Company, where I worked after graduation. I had gone to Douglass College, the women\u2019s college of Rutgers, in New Jersey, and returned ignominiously to Cleveland because I couldn\u2019t think of anything better to do. The costume company was fun for a while. I stuck it out through the Christmas season, and then I called a local dairy and asked whether there were any openings for milkmen.',  ', I had had a fantasy for years about owning a dairy farm. I liked cows: they led a placid yet productive life. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had a lady drive a milk truck, but there\u2019s no reason not,\u201d a man at the plant said. The route they gave me was in Fairview Park, a suburb west of Cleveland. The milk truck had two sets of pedals, one with the standard three for a stick shift, for driving sitting down when you were going long distances, and the other for driving standing up, when you were hopping between houses.',  ', I had half a mind to stay in Cleveland and try to marry the boss\u2019s son (he raised beef cattle), but I gave up the milk route to get a master\u2019s in English at the University of Vermont. One summer, I worked nights in a cheese factory, packaging mozzarella. A team of women, wearing white rubber aprons, yellow rubber gloves, green rubber boots, and hairnets, pulled bricks of mozzarella out of vats of cold salt water, labelled them, bagged them, sealed the bags, boxed the cheese, and stacked the boxes. I had a secret yen to operate the forklift truck. Also, while in graduate school, I started reading ', The New Yorker', .',  ', I sometimes visited one of my brothers, who lived in New York. He had gone to the Art Students League, where he made friends with a woman in his portrait class named Jeanne Fleischmann. She was married to Peter Fleischmann, the chairman of the board of ', The New Yorker', . His father, Raoul Fleischmann, had been the co-founder of the magazine, with Harold Ross. On one visit, I picked up a copy of the magazine. It was dated February 24, 1975. Eustace Tilley was on the cover, and the contents included a piece by E. B. White: \u201cLetter from the East.\u201d It was the anniversary issue\u2014', The New Yorker', \u2019', s',  fiftieth.',  ', Eventually, I met the Fleischmanns. I was doing research for my master\u2019s thesis, on James Thurber, and while Peter was away on business he let me sit in his office and look through bound volumes of the magazine. At the Morgan Library, in an exhibit of books that had belonged to writers, I found a grammar mistake on the wall label accompanying Thurber\u2019s copy of Hemingway\u2019s \u201cGreen Hills of Africa,\u201d in which he had made pencil drawings of Papa and Memsahib on safari. I was given permission to examine the book. (I made freehand copies of the illustrations and appended them to my thesis. My examiners were not amused.) In Vermont, I kept two stacks of magazines on my lobster-crate coffee table, one of ', Hoard\u2019s Dairyman ', and one of ', The New Yorker', .',  ', I made up my mind to move to New York in the fall of 1977. I drove there in my old Plymouth, with my cat, my books pared down to the bare essentials, and two hundred dollars. The Fleischmanns, whose grown children had moved out, were still in parental mode, and they befriended me readily. I spent many a cocktail hour in their den, drinking their Heineken and listening to Peter\u2019s stories. Peter drank Scotch-and-water, chain-smoked, and swallowed Maalox by the handful. He told war stories (he was in the Battle of the Bulge) and stories about Yale and about his father, Raoul (the family came from Austria), and croquet games with Harpo Marx making an impossible shot by sawing up a tire and wrapping it around a tree trunk.',  ', That fall, I had a reverse commute from the financial district to Paterson, New Jersey, where I was washing dishes in a friend\u2019s restaurant. The friend paid my bus fare and gave me all the beer I could drink. In return, I tried not to throw away the silverware when I scraped the dishes. Often, I got off the bus on the way home and walked over the George Washington Bridge. I worked on my thesis, and sometimes despaired. Peter pointed out that even if I never finished the thesis or got the master\u2019s degree, it was no reason to despair. Peter had no influence in the editorial department\u2014like his father, he kept business and editorial strictly separate. But he offered to call Robert Bingham, the executive editor, and ask him to talk with me. We met, and Bingham was very nice, but there were no openings.',  ', I quit the dishwashing job and worked as a cashier at Korvettes during the Christmas rush. I could not figure out whether to be sad or relieved when the management did not recognize my talent and keep me on. I did temp work. I was on the verge of trying to get a hack license so that I could drive a cab when Peter, possibly sensing an ambulance in my future, suggested that I give Bingham a follow-up call.',  ', There was an opening! Two, in fact, one in the typing pool and one in the editorial library. I flunked the test for the typing pool. It was on an electric typewriter, and I was used to a manual\u2014at least, that was my excuse. If my hands trembled over the keyboard, the typewriter took off without me. The other interview went better. Once I got a whiff of the library\u2014that bookish, dusty, paste-and-paper smell so peculiar to libraries\u2014I felt that I was in my element. Helen Stark, who was only the second person ever to be in charge of the library, had a noble head\u2014you could see her profile on a coin\u2014and strong features. She and three girls sat at desks that faced each other in a cloverleaf arrangement. Helen gave me a typing test\u2014on a manual typewriter, cramming words onto an index card (I aced it)\u2014and borrowed an empty office for the interview. I remember her arranging her skirt, which was black and wide at the hem, when she crossed her legs. (My skirt was a forest-green Danskin wraparound that a friend had picked up at a thrift shop in New Jersey, and I didn\u2019t realize until the next time I wore it that one end of the hem hung some eight inches longer than the other.) I was all aglow, and Helen warned me that it was not a glamorous job. But she knew from experience that nothing she said could dim my enthusiasm or overturn my conviction that I would soon be one of the \u201cyoung friends\u201d whose \u201cletters\u201d were published in The Talk of the Town.',  ', I started work on Monday, typing summaries of the fiction in that week\u2019s issue and indexing it under key words. As Helen and I were leaving that night, an editor named Pat Crow got on the elevator at the eighteenth floor with us. I noticed his boots\u2014big mud-green rubber boots\u2014and said, \u201cThose are the kind of boots we wore in the cheese factory.\u201d He looked at Helen and said, \u201cSo this is the next stop after the cheese factory?\u201d',  ', Eventually, I became what was known as a collator\u2014a Bartleby-like occupation that computers have since done away with. In collating, you used a pencil to carefully transfer changes from various proofs from the editor, the author, the proofreaders (usually two), the lawyer, and the fact checker onto a clean proof for the printer. It was not a job I was born for: it demanded legible handwriting, and my penmanship had been deteriorating since third grade. But you learned how the place ran: collating was the nexus, it was where everything came together.',  ', The big challenge in collating was what were called Gould proofs. Eleanor Gould was ', The New Yorker', \u2019', s',  head grammarian and query proofreader. She was a certified genius\u2014a member not just of Mensa but of some übergroup within Mensa\u2014and the magazine\u2019s editor-in-chief at the time, William Shawn, had complete faith in her. She read everything in galley\u2014everything except fiction, that is, which she had been taken off of years earlier, as I understood it, because she treated everyone the same, be it Marcel Proust or Annie Proulx or Vladimir Nabokov. Clarity was Eleanor\u2019s lodestar, \u201cFowler\u2019s Modern English\u201d her bible, and by the time she was done with a proof the pencil lines on it looked like dreadlocks. Some of the fact pieces were ninety columns long, and Mr. Shawn took every query. My all-time favorite Eleanor Gould query was on Christmas Gifts for Children: the writer had repeated the old saw that every Raggedy Ann doll has \u201cI love you\u201d written on her little wooden heart, and Eleanor wrote in the margin that it did not, and she knew, because as a child she had performed open-heart surgery on her rag doll and seen with her own eyes that nothing was written on the heart.',  ', Then I was allowed to work on the copydesk. It changed the way I read prose\u2014I was paid to find mistakes, and it was a long time before I could once again read for pleasure. I spontaneously copy-edited everything I laid eyes on. I had a paperback edition of Faulkner\u2019s \u201cThe Hamlet\u201d that was so riddled with typos that it almost ruined Flem Snopes for me. But, as I relaxed on the copydesk, I was sometimes even able to enjoy myself. There were writers who weren\u2019t very good and yet were impossible to improve, like figure skaters who hit all the technical marks but have a limited artistic appeal and sport unflattering costumes. There were competent writers on interesting subjects who were just careless enough in their spelling and punctuation to keep a girl occupied. And there were writers whose prose came in so highly polished that I couldn\u2019t believe I was getting paid to read them: John Updike, Pauline Kael, Mark Singer, Ian Frazier! In a way, these were the hardest, because the prose lulled me into complacency. They transcended the office of the copy editor. It was hard to stay alert for opportunities to meddle in an immaculate manuscript, yet if you missed something you couldn\u2019t use that as an excuse. The only thing to do was style the spelling, and even that could be fraught. Oliver Sacks turned out to be attached to the spelling of \u201csulphur\u201d and \u201csulphuric\u201d that he remembered from his chemistry experiments as a boy. (', The New Yorker',  spells it less romantically: \u201csulfur,\u201d \u201csulfuric.\u201d)',  ', When Pauline Kael typed \u201cprevert\u201d instead of \u201cpervert,\u201d she meant \u201cprevert\u201d (unless she was reviewing something by Jacques Prévert). Luckily, she was kind, and if you changed it she would just change it back and stet it without upbraiding you. Kael revised up until closing, and though we lackeys resented writers who kept changing \u201cdoughnut\u201d to \u201ccoffee cake\u201d then back to \u201cdoughnut\u201d and then \u201ccoffee cake\u201d again, because it meant more work for us, Kael\u2019s changes were always improvements. She approached me once with a proof in her hand. She couldn\u2019t figure out how to fix something, and I was the only one around. She knew me from chatting in the ladies\u2019 room on the eighteenth floor. I looked at the proof and made a suggestion, and she was delighted. \u201cYou helped me!\u201d she gasped.',  ', I was on the copydesk when John McPhee\u2019s pieces on geology were set up. I tried to keep my head. There was not much to do. McPhee was like John Updike, in that he turned in immaculate copy. Really, all I had to do was read. I\u2019d heard that McPhee compared his manuscript with the galleys, so anything ', The New Yorker',  did he noticed. I just looked up words in the dictionary to check the spelling (which was invariably correct, but I had to check) and determined whether compound words were hyphenated, whether hyphenated words should be closed up or printed as two words, or whether I should stet the hyphen. It was my province to capitalize the \u201ci\u201d in Interstate 80, hyphenate I-80, and lowercase \u201cthe interstate.\u201d',  ', In Part II of \u201cIn Suspect Terrain,\u201d I came to this sentence and thought I might have spotted an error: \u201cBut rock columns are generalized; they are atremble with hiatuses; and they depend in large part on well borings, which are shallow, and on seismic studies, which are new, and far between.\u201d The itchy-fingered copy editor hovered at the threshold. I wanted to let her in. I wasn\u2019t going to touch the comma, but I was desperate to correct that \u201cnew, and far between\u201d to \u201cfew, and far between.\u201d I could save McPhee from making a horrible mistake! But many people with finer minds than mine were lined up to read the copy when I was through. They would not assume that \u201cnew\u201d was a typo for \u201cfew,\u201d and if they had any doubt they could query it, asking the author through his editor, and there would be no harm done. But I was hellbent on rectifying what might be a glitch in a cliché. It was a Friday\u2014I remember, because I knew that if I made this change I would have to live all weekend with the possibility, which could swiftly morph into a certainty, that I had made a mistake. Two mistakes: I would have gone beyond my province, and I would have introduced an error into McPhee\u2019s carefully wrought prose.',  ', So I stayed my hand, the itchy-fingered hand with the pencil in it, and spent the weekend with a clean conscience. As soon as I left the office, I felt relieved that I had let it alone. What ever made me think that McPhee would misspell, or even mistype, the word \u201cfew\u201d?',  ', That was more than thirty years ago. And it has now been more than twenty years since I became a page O.K.\u2019er\u2014a position that exists only at ', The New Yorker', , where you query-proofread pieces and manage them, with the editor, the author, a fact checker, and a second proofreader, until they go to press. An editor once called us prose goddesses; another job description might be comma queen. Except for writing, I have never seriously considered doing anything else.',  ', One of the things I like about my job is that it draws on the entire person: not just your knowledge of grammar and punctuation and usage and foreign languages and literature but also your experience of travel, gardening, shipping, singing, plumbing, Catholicism, Midwesternism, mozzarella, the A train, New Jersey. And in turn it feeds you more experience. The popular image of the copy editor is of someone who favors rigid consistency. I don\u2019t usually think of myself that way. But, when pressed, I do find I have strong views about commas.',  ', The comma as we know it was invented by Aldo Manuzio, a printer working in Venice, circa 1500. It was intended to prevent confusion by separating things. In the Greek, ', komma',  means \u201csomething cut off,\u201d a segment. (Aldo was printing Greek classics during the High Renaissance. The comma was a Renaissance invention.) As the comma proliferated, it started generating confusion. Basically, there are two schools of thought: One plays by ear, using the comma to mark a pause, like dynamics in music; if you were reading aloud, the comma would suggest when to take a breath. The other uses punctuation to clarify the meaning of a sentence by illuminating its underlying structure. Each school believes that the other gets carried away. It can be tense and kind of silly, like the argument among theologians about how many angels can fit on the head of a pin. How many commas can fit into a sentence by Herman Melville? Or, closer to home, into a sentence from ', The New Yorker', ?',  ', Even something as ostensibly simple as the serial comma can arouse strong feelings. The serial comma is the one before \u201cand\u201d in a series of three or more things. With the serial comma: My favorite cereals are Cheerios, Raisin Bran, and Shredded Wheat. Without the serial comma: I used to like Kix, Trix and Wheat Chex. Proponents of the serial comma say that it is preferable because it prevents ambiguity, and I\u2019ll go along with that. Also, I\u2019m lazy, and I find it easier to use the serial comma consistently rather than stop every time I come to a series and register whether or not the comma before the \u201cand\u201d preceding the last item is actually preventing ambiguity. But pressed to come up with an example of a series that was unambiguously ambiguous without the serial comma I couldn\u2019t think of a good one. An ambiguous series proved so elusive that I wondered whether perhaps we could do without the serial comma after all. In my office, this is heresy, but I will say it anyway and risk being shunned in the elevator: Isn\u2019t the \u201cand\u201d sufficient? After all, that\u2019s what the other commas in a series stand for: \u201cLions and tigers and bears, oh my!\u201d A comma preceding \u201cand\u201d is redundant. I was at risk of becoming a comma apostate.',  ', Fortunately, the Internet is busy with examples of series that are absurd without the serial comma:',  ', \u201cWe invited the strippers, J.F.K. and Stalin.\u201d (This has been illustrated online, and formed the basis of a poll: which stripper had the better outfit, J.F.K. or Stalin.)',  ', \u201cThis book is dedicated to my parents, Ayn Rand and God.\u201d',  ', And there was the country-and-Western singer who was joined onstage by his two ex-wives, Kris Kristofferson and Waylon Jennings.',  ', \u201cWho\u2019s God?\u201d',      ', Share',  ', Tweet',  ',  ', Buy a cartoon',  ',    ', The bottom line is to choose one and be consistent and try not to make a moral issue out of it. Or is it? Maybe it\u2019s better to judge each series on its merits, applying the serial comma where it\u2019s needed and suppressing it where it\u2019s not. Many newspapers, both American and British, do not use the serial comma, which underscores the idea that the news is meant to be read fast, in the dead-tree version or on the screen, because it\u2019s not news for long. It\u2019s ephemeral. Print\u2014or, rather, text\u2014should be streamlined and unencumbered. Maybe the day is coming when the newsfeed-style three dots (ellipsis) between items, like the eternal ribbon of news circling the building at One Times Square, will dominate, and all text will look like Céline. Certainly advertising\u2014billboards, road signs, neon\u2014repels punctuation. Leaving out the serial comma saves time and space. The editors of Webster\u2019s Third saved eighty pages by cutting down on commas.',  ', But suppose you\u2019re not in a hurry. Suppose you move your lips when you read, or pronounce every word aloud in your head, and you\u2019re reading a Victorian novel or a history of Venice. You have plenty of time to crunch commas. If I worked for a publication that did not use the serial comma, I would adjust\u2014convert from orthodox to reformed\u2014but for now I remain loyal to the serial comma, because it actually does sometimes prevent ambiguity and because I\u2019ve gotten used to the way it looks. It gives starch to the prose, and can be very effective. If a sentence were a picket fence, the serial commas would be posts at regular intervals.',  ', The term \u201cOxford comma\u201d refers to the Oxford University Press, whose house style is to use the serial comma. (The public-relations department at Oxford doesn\u2019t insist on it, however. Presumably P.R. people see it as a waste of time and space. The serial comma is a pawn in the war between town and gown.) To call it the Oxford comma gives it a bit of class, a little snob appeal. Chances are that if you use the Oxford comma you brush the crumbs off your shirtfront before going out.',  ', There is a fancy word for \u201cgoing beyond your province\u201d: \u201cultracrepidate.\u201d So much of copy editing is about not going beyond your province. Anti-ultracrepidationism. Writers might think we\u2019re applying rules and sticking it to their prose in order to make it fit some standard, but just as often we\u2019re backing off, making exceptions, or at least trying to find a balance between doing too much and doing too little. A lot of the decisions you have to make as a copy editor are subjective. For instance, an issue that comes up all the time, whether to use \u201cthat\u201d or \u201cwhich,\u201d depends on what the writer means. It\u2019s interpretive, not mechanical\u2014though the answer often boils down to an implicit understanding of commas.',  ', Think of the great Dylan Thomas line \u201cThe force that through the green fuse drives the flower.\u201d It\u2019s a bit unfair to consider this as an example, because (1) it\u2019s poetry, and we can\u2019t all write (or drink) like Dylan Thomas, and (2) nobody remembers what comes next. It goes like this: \u201cThe force that through the green fuse drives the flower / Drives my green age.\u201d A gorgeous line. Although it is verse, and quoting any more of it would confuse the issue, it nevertheless passes the test for determining whether to use \u201cthat\u201d or \u201cwhich\u201d: if the phrase or clause introduced by a relative pronoun\u2014\u201cthat\u201d or \u201cwhich\u201d\u2014is essential to the meaning of the sentence, \u201cthat\u201d is preferred, and it is not separated from its antecedent by a comma. Maybe some inferior poet would write, \u201cThe force which through the green fuse drives the flower\u201d (the audience at his reading would snort), or, worse, \u201cThe force, which through the green fuse drives the flower, / Drives my green age\u201d (this writer would never make it into print, unless he hired a good copy editor). \u201cThe force\u201d has no meaning without \u201cthat through the green fuse.\u201d Take it away and you are left with \u201cThe force . . . drives my green age,\u201d leaving you to wonder, What force? Are we watching \u201cStar Wars\u201d? \u201cMay the Force, which through the green fuse drives the flower, be with you.\u201d I can hear Bill Murray saying this, but not Dylan Thomas or Han Solo.',  ', The New Yorker',  practices a \u201cclose\u201d style of punctuation. Or, as E. B. White once put it, \u201cCommas in ', The New Yorker',  fall with the precision of knives in a circus act, outlining the victim.\u201d If the sentence has an introductory clause (like this one), we separate it with a comma. But if the introductory clause follows a conjunction we don\u2019t. We do make exceptions for \u201csince\u201d or \u201calthough.\u201d If the meaning of the introductory clause is restrictive we don\u2019t use the comma. A restrictive clause does not want to be separate from what it modifies: it wants to be one with it, to be essential to it, to identify with it totally. (She was a graduate of a school that had very high standards.) Everything else is nonrestrictive. (He graduated from another school, which would admit anyone with a pulse.)',  ', It\u2019s not always easy to decide what\u2019s restrictive. That\u2019s where judgment comes in. For instance, here is a sentence, chock-full of commas, from this magazine, that was quoted by Ben Yagoda in an online article for the ', Times:',  \u201cBefore Atwater died, of brain cancer, in 1991, he expressed regret.\u201d Yagoda wrote, \u201cNo other publication would put a comma after \u2018died\u2019 or \u2018cancer.\u2019 ', The New Yorker',  does so because otherwise (or so the thinking goes), the sentence would suggest that Atwater died multiple times and of multiple causes.\u201d He added, \u201cThat is nutty, of course.\u201d The ', Times', \u2014along with Yagoda, who teaches journalism\u2014prefers an \u201copen\u201d style of punctuation, where the words stream together and every phrase or clause is of equal moment, leaving the reader to figure it out. Some readers are especially proud of their ability to figure it out and like to write letters of complaint and, put, a, comma, after, every, word, to show us the error of our ways.',  ', Secretly, I wondered if I agreed with Yagoda. Once, when I was collating a Gould proof, I had the unsettling thought \u201cWhat if Eleanor ever loses it?\u201d What if all these commas and hyphens and subtleties of usage prove to be the products of a benign delusion? That was during the Reagan Administration, when many of us suspected that Reagan had some form of dementia, but no one could do anything about it. The country was running on automatic. What if that was the case with Eleanor and ', The New Yorker', ? She was getting old, and she went deaf in her later years, so she was tragically isolated from the sounds of speech that were represented in the words she groomed. There was not a single thing anyone would be able to do about it. No one would enter the copy department and say to Eleanor, \u201cDrop the pencil and step away from the desk.\u201d We were in her thrall, as the nation was in Reagan\u2019s thrall. I jumped up and went to a colleague\u2019s office and said, \u201cWhat if Eleanor goes crazy?\u201d From the expression on her face\u2014\u201cYou\u2019re only figuring this out now?\u201d\u2014I knew that we were all well advanced down the path.',  ', Having been teased in the ', Times',  about ', New Yorker',  commas, I took a good, hard look at the magazine\u2019s policy, and I persuaded myself that in fact these commas were not indiscriminate. They marked off segments of the sentence that were not germane to the meaning. The point of the sentence Yagoda had chosen for mild ridicule, as I pointed out in an online response, is that Atwater expressed regret before he died. What he died of and when he died of it are both extra details that the author, Jane Mayer, provides only to satisfy the reader\u2019s curiosity. They aren\u2019t essential to the meaning of the sentence. They are nonrestrictive.',  ', A while later, a reader wrote in objecting to the commas in this opening sentence of a piece by Marc Fisher: \u201cWhen I was in high school, at Horace Mann, in the Bronx, in the nineteen-seventies, everyone took pride in the brilliant eccentricity of our teachers.\u201d The gist of that sentence is that at Horace Mann students enjoyed interacting with their crazy teachers. But if all you see when you read it is the commas, you miss that. Close punctuation is not meant as a guide to stops and starts, like Dickens\u2019s and Melville\u2019s commas. ', The New Yorker',  isn\u2019t asking you to pause and gasp for breath at every comma. That\u2019s not what close punctuation is about. The commas are marking a thoughtful subordination of information. I really don\u2019t see how any of them could be done without. The writer went to only one high school, a very special, one-of-a-kind private school that happened to be in the Bronx, and the time that he went there was the nineteen-seventies. None of that is particularly interesting except in the context of a piece that promises to be about the bond between students and teachers. The punctuation is almost like Braille, providing a kind of bas-relief, accentuating the topography of the sentence. It looks choppy, but you don\u2019t have to chop it up when you read it. It is Aldo Manuzio\u2019s comma taken to its logical extreme. It\u2019s not insane\u2014it\u2019s not even nutty. It\u2019s just showing what\u2019s important in the sentence in a subtle way. Another publication would let you figure it out for yourself. And, if that\u2019s what you want, you can always read some other magazine.',  ', In the summer of 2013, in New Haven, where I had gone for the wedding of a friend, I picked up a copy of \u201cLight Years,\u201d by James Salter. I started it in an old hotel, the Duncan, feeling slightly sad that I had never gotten to go to Yale.',  ', \u201cLight Years\u201d is about a marriage, its surface\u2014an enviable round of dinner parties and indulgent Christmas projects (the daughters of the house actually have a pony) in a picture-postcard setting within commuting distance of Manhattan\u2014and its coming apart from underneath. James Salter is a pen name; the writer\u2019s name is James Horowitz. His other novels include \u201cA Sport and a Pastime\u201d and \u201cAll That Is.\u201d ', The New Yorker',  staff writer Nick Paumgarten had recently written a long piece about him, and there was so much buzz about it in the office that I read it on my own time.',  ', This was my first taste of James Salter himself, and his prose is exquisite, so well groomed that I was surprised to come to a sentence with what I considered a superfluous comma: \u201cEve was across the room in a thin, burgundy dress that showed the faint outline of her stomach.\u201d It stopped me. Usage guides say that if you can substitute \u201cand\u201d for the comma it belongs there. I gave James Salter the \u201cand\u201d test, and \u201cthin and burgundy\u201d did not pass. If this had crossed my desk, I would have taken the comma out and made it \u201ca thin burgundy dress.\u201d',  ', The logic behind this rule is that the two adjectives are not coördinate: they do not belong to the same order. One adjective (\u201cburgundy\u201d) clings more tenaciously to the noun (\u201cdress\u201d) than the other (\u201cthin\u201d). Bryan Garner, the expert in American usage, offers another test: reverse the order of the adjectives. Would you ever say \u201ca burgundy, thin dress\u201d? I wouldn\u2019t.',  ', I wondered whether this was the author\u2019s comma or whether it had slipped past the copy editor. I doubted that it was something a copy editor would add. This edition of \u201cLight Years\u201d was typographically flawless. Was it possible that the comma was retained at the author\u2019s insistence? Consider the context: \u201cEve was across the room in a thin, burgundy dress that showed the faint outline of her stomach.\u201d Was the author trying to emphasize the thinness of the fabric in order to linger over the \u201cfaint outline\u201d of her stomach? If so, I thought he was misguided, not to say lecherous. (Her name is Eve: she\u2019s obviously a temptress.) But was I going to let a superfluous comma prevent me from enjoying a good read? It didn\u2019t stop me in Dickens, and it wouldn\u2019t stop me in Salter. I persisted.',  ', I was not completely impartial. \u201cLight Years\u201d had an introduction by Richard Ford, whose work I once tried to take a comma out of. The offending comma followed the word \u201cSo\u201d at the beginning of a line of dialogue, and Ford preferred to retain it. The choice of Richard Ford for the introduction suggested to me that James Salter, like Richard Ford, might be stubborn about his punctuation. He might be one of the \u201cear\u201d guys, the ones who think they have to orchestrate each sentence.',  ', Then it happened again: \u201cShe smiled that stunning, wide smile.\u201d The phrase \u201cstunning and wide\u201d doesn\u2019t make it for me, and neither does \u201cwide and stunning\u201d (although I would have read right over \u201cwide, stunning smile\u201d). The narrator has already remarked on the wideness of the character\u2019s smile (hence the \u201cthat\u201d in \u201cthat stunning, wide smile\u201d) and is intensifying its attractiveness at the second reference. \u201cStunning\u201d qualifies the wide smile. Adjectives not coördinate. No comma.',  ', Again: \u201cIt was as if they were aboard ship: some old, island steamer.\u201d An \u201cisland steamer\u201d is a kind of boat. There is no danger of someone\u2019s misreading the phrase as a steamer from \u201csome old island.\u201d',  ', And another nautical reference: \u201cThe ship was enormous . . . the vastness of its black, stained side overwhelmed them.\u201d This comma seems to be trying to repel a hyphen hovering between \u201cblack\u201d and \u201cstained.\u201d It is not a \u201cblack-stained side\u201d but a black side, stained: a black stained side.',  ', It\u2019s not that these four extraneous (to my ear) commas diminished my enjoyment of the book, but I did stop and wonder where they came from, the author or the editor, and whether there was any discussion about them. James Salter clearly has a sharp ear and a fine eye. His pen name evokes the word \u201cpsalter\u201d while suggesting earthiness. In doing without a hyphen in the title \u201cLight Years\u201d (Webster\u2019s spells it \u201clight-year\u201d), he cubes the meaning: carefree years, seen from an astronomical distance. Just for balance, here is one of his finest commas: \u201cHe sailed on the ', France',  in the noisy, sad afternoon.\u201d Sad and noisy, noisy and sad. \u201cNoisy\u201d is especially effective because it evokes \u201cnausea,\u201d from the Greek for \u201cseasickness.\u201d Could a writer so sensitive to language have a thing for kinky punctuation?',  ', It was enough to make me doubt my comma sense. Some days, \u201cthin and burgundy\u201d sounded just fine. At work, coming to the phrase \u201ca stout, middle-aged woman,\u201d I automatically started to pluck the comma out and then became unsure. \u201cStout and middle-aged\u201d? I don\u2019t think so. \u201cMiddle-aged and stout\u201d? Definitely not. Wasn\u2019t it the same as \u201ca fat old lady\u201d? \u201cFat and old\u201d? \u201cOld and fat\u201d? An old fat lady? \u201cAn old fat lady\u201d suggests that the fat lady in the circus is being hounded out of her job by an ambitious new fat lady, at which point she will become just another fat old lady. I was driving myself mad.',  ', I decided to write to James Salter and ask him about his commas. He wrote back:',  ', \u201cI sometimes ignore the rules about commas although generally I follow convention and adhere to the advice in Strunk and White. Punctuation is for clarity and also emphasis, but I also feel that, if the writing warrants it, punctuation can contribute to the music and rhythm of the sentences. You don\u2019t get permission for this, of course; you take the liberty.\u201d',  ', When a writer who is not a poet invokes rhythm, copy editors often exchange looks. But Salter went on to describe the reasoning behind each of the commas in question. As I had suspected, with the comma in \u201cEve was across the room in a thin, burgundy dress that showed the faint outline of her stomach,\u201d he was trying to emphasize the contours of the stomach under the dress. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a thin burgundy dress,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt was a thin dress, burgundy in color. I wanted the reader to be aware of the thinness. So you are right. The copy editor probably marked out the comma, and I wrote stet.\u201d He was doing the same thing with \u201cstunning, wide smile,\u201d trying to control the impact of the \u201cstunning\u201d by smacking it with a comma as one would put English on a cue ball. Of my next example, he wrote, \u201cI suppose that there\u2019s no chance of a reader thinking it\u2019s an old island, but I felt an instant of hesitation about old and island as I read the words and wanted to eliminate that.\u201d For this reader, the comma added rather than eliminated the hesitation. As for the last, he wrote, \u201cI think black stained side is too loose. It\u2019s not, as you say, black-stained, but black and also stained. The comma fixes that.\u201d Though Manuzio invented the comma in order to separate parts of a sentence, it can tie words together as efficiently as it keeps them apart.',  ', Some would scoff at these explanations, but I am grateful for them, even if Salter does have some untoward ideas about what you can do with commas and imputes to them a power that verges on magic. The writer is not always the best judge of his own effects, but at least he\u2019s thinking about them. The comma does not fix everything. Sometimes it gets in the way. Salter ended his letter with a recommendation for further reading: \u201cThe commas are better in \u2018A Sport and a Pastime.\u2019 \u201d',  ', While in graduate school in Vermont, I decided I should learn how cars worked. I wanted to be self-reliant. I drove a \u201965 Plymouth Fury II, in dark blue-green. It had a huge expanse of windshield, which was great for scenic drives and winter sunsets, and a V-8 engine, which meant nothing to me. I knew how to pump gas and check the oil and change a flat tire, but that was about it. My father, a fireman, had discouraged me from learning anything about the workings of the internal-combustion engine. When I said I wanted to learn how cars worked, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s easy. I\u2019ll tell you everything you need to know. You put the key in the ignition and you turn it.\u201d',  ', Thanks, Dad. To his credit, he had also advised me to cultivate a mechanic at a local gas station. But out in the Vermont countryside there were no gas stations\u2014just a pump at Marble\u2019s Store, where you could leave the keys in the car and Marble would move it if it was in the way. So I registered for an adult-education class in auto mechanics one night a week at the local high school. On the first night, the auto-mechanics teacher used a word I had never understood the meaning of: \u201cgasket.\u201d I had blown one once, on a friend\u2019s car, driving too fast on hair-raising canyon roads in Utah, and I knew that it cost a lot to replace, and the car was never the same. (Sorry!) Now, at last, I was going to find out what a gasket was. So I raised my hand and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s a gasket?\u201d The teacher, who looked like a used-car salesman, defined \u201cgasket\u201d by using three other words that I didn\u2019t know the meaning of: \u201ccrankcase,\u201d \u201cpistons,\u201d \u201ccarburetor.\u201d I\u2019m still not sure what a gasket is.',  ', Grammar also has some intimidating terms, and grammarians throw them around constantly, but you don\u2019t need to know them in order to use the language. E. B. White once said that before working on \u201cThe Elements of Style\u201d he was the kind of writer who did not have \u201cany exact notion of what is taking place under the hood.\u201d You notice a gasket only when someone blows it. To understand how the language works, though\u2014to master the mechanics of it\u2014you have to roll up your sleeves and join the ink-stained wretches as we name the parts. But if that doesn\u2019t work for you, just put the key in the ignition and turn it. ', \u2666',  			',
