				Annapurna Microfinance Pvt. Ltd (AMPL), a microfinance venture of people\u2019s Forum which is more than two decades old development organization. It is a Non Banking Financial Company regulated by Reserve Bank of India. It is promoted by Mr. Gobinda Chandra Pattanaik (Member Secretary cum CEO of People\u2019s Forum). It was previously named as Gwalior Finance & Leasing Pvt. Ltd & was involved in financing & leasing business.

People\u2019s Forum promotes self-help groups (SHGs) consisting of women members and operating in rural and urban areas. On the strategic front, they have realized that with the growing demand for microfinance activities, they would face lots of limitation with the current legal form. In November 2009 the promoters of People\u2019s Forum acquired Gwalior Finance and Leasing Company Private Limited, a NBFC registered in Varanasi (Uttar Pradesh). The name of the NBFC was changed to Annapurna Microfinance Private Limited (AMPL) in  February 2010...', read more',
