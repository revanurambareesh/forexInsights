', Comments', Jim G.', September 9, 2016 at 09:45', Yes, the exception does not prove the rule. The evidence is completely clear.', Reply', Iain Salisbury', September 10, 2016 at 10:05', Mary Dejevsky points out in "i" that, far from prompting social mobility, comprehensive schools have damaged the prospects for our most able pupils and actually made our top universities less inclusive.   She is surely correct to suggest that it's time to "bring back grammars."   While Ofsted Chief Inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw has sneered at their value to those who can't afford private education, he has also been savage in his recent criticism of the "under-achievement and unfulfilled potential" [1] of able pupils within the state system.   His Office has reported that students who attend grammar schools have a 57% chance of acquiring the highest grades at GCSE, while the figure for those with the same primary school performance sent to non-selective schools falls to 32% [2]. Part of the problem is that obliterating the grammars has not seen an influx of top graduates into the comprehensives but has simply lost them to education altogether.   Very considerable sums have been made available to recruit such people and questions have been asked in Parliament concerning the failure of these initiatives.   Once, grammar schools with sixth forms offered attractive careers to highly qualified graduates, anxious to teach well motivated pupils to the highest level.   Since this is no longer a significant option, it is increasingly the case that these people seek employment outside the school sector.    In half a century, comprehensives have done nothing positive for social mobility but have, indeed, made the country increasingly dependent on the private sector. Where else are you likely to find a linguist, these days?     It won't to appeal Mr. Johnson or to the other left-wing bigots who  have long had a stranglehold on the education establishment but it may be time to stop the ham-fisted attempts at social engineering and repurpose or schools towards education?

[2] https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/mar/04/state-secondary-schools-still-letting-down-talented-pupils-says-ofsted', Reply', John A.', September 10, 2016 at 10:58', \u201cIf she\u2019s genuine about tackling inequality...\u201d From the point of view of a mathematician it is obvious that if she is genuine in this regard then one of the things she will do is reduce, or preferably eliminate, regressive taxes. The case for progressivity is watertight. Value Added Tax, along with a rich diversity of other regressive impositions, is nothing other than a means of repression. On the one hand such taxes impede the upward mobility of those with little capital or none, while on the other they help facilitate a lower top rate of income tax and thereby an upward flow of wealth to the modern aristocracy. Such taxation is pernicious rather than economically necessary, and an enlightened administration that believed in a reasonable level of egalitarianism would have nothing to do with them. The outright abolition of regressive taxes would do more for the disadvantaged than any number of grammar schools.', Reply', Mark Kasozimusoke', September 10, 2016 at 14:42', A useful article by Alan Johnson. I fear that he is correct that the majority of children who do not jump the hurdle essentially suffer 'second class' provision even if the absurd "school uniform test" is abolished for the brightest poor children. Clearly what is required are more teachers, better teachers, more motivated teachers, better supported teachers, free thinking teachers and smaller class sizes. All of these can be found in the independent sector, good grammar schools and in 'leafy' suburban comprehensives. If you read May's speech it is astonishing in its breadth and depth. She mentions selection at 14 and 16 yrs which her critics never discuss. She mentions forcing independent schools to support state schools and challenges their rights to maintaining charitable status. She wants to pool teaching talent and would insist on wealthy schools offering classes for pupils from outside their school especially in the rarer, more esoteric subjects. She wants more capacity and does not shy away from the Cameroonian philosophy of state funding to 'free' schools. Some of this is repeat of Gove's ideas, some an extension. She even wants Catholics(even though she is Protestant) to extend their schools so that they can replicate their discipline. She is relaxed about more exclusive segregation based on religion if it means more provision of school places. This is particularly muddled thinking but at least it seems honest(if she actually wrote this part)... She talks about Universities having a commitment to assist bright, disadvantaged children. She mentions ways of trying to get around the middle class games of home tutors and the "house price catchment area". The body of the speech does not resemble the public persona of a stern, no nonsense Conservative. She talks of a pluralist utopia with choice and provision for all classes and creeds. It is all laudable but equally laughable in that her vision is unobtainable and the missing words - "government investment" are relatively conspicuous by their absence. The relentless focus on grammar schools is wrong and an unnecessary distraction but after all she is a politician; so she must 'play to the gallery' and appease some supporters as well as appearing tough on some of her own....', Reply', John A.', October 1, 2016 at 07:10', "She even wants Catholics (even though she is Protestant) to extend their schools so that they can replicate their discipline." Only an exceptional prime minister will want to do away with the inculcation of superstition into children.', Reply', Hugh B', September 10, 2016 at 11:42', One or two experiences and so me hearsay does not make a comeback nvincing case. After a question after of a century teaching, I can only report that my time and n a grammar school has afforded me experience, time after time, of young people from perfectly ordinary and quite often deeply deprived backgrounds riding to become confident, able and successful people. The "expensive grammar school uniform" is no more costly than the comprehensive or even primary school uniforms in my borough of London, either. In any case, since when is the cost of a uniform an argument about education? This kind of argument is not only intellectually dishonest, it casts the entrance test as a boundary between success in life and failure. That is arrant nonsense: if you go to the comprehensive schools in a district that has grammar schools, you will not find teacher's who treat their students as failures. On the contrary, teachers will strive to raise them to the highest level that is possible. Why not write disparagingly about Russell Group universities or Oxbridge? No; calling children failures if they don't get into a grammar school is what  is regressive. A responsible education system would work vigorously on the premise that different schools are different paths to success. And the main culprit here is the socially accepted belief that being a doctor is more 'successful ' than being a builder. Responsible media would  desist from implying that comprehensive education is inferior by calling selective education 'unfair'.', Reply', Stuart C.', September 12, 2016 at 10:55', u"Thanks for this piece Alan. As a primary state-schooled kid who passed the 11+and went to a country grammar, I've always found it difficult to look at grammar schools and see them as anything but great for those inside the gates. 

Because - and I know this isn't true for everyone but it certainly was for myself and my school friends - grammar school was a really great thing. You were part of something, something historic, and everyone about you knew how to learn - in whatever fields they were interested in. And perhaps more than that they tended to have the confidence and the necessary energy (qi) to make the day happen. Carpe diem and all that.

That said, my friends from home - who all went to secondary moderns - were all pretty pleased with themselves, and when I look at the doctors and directors from that tiny, unpromising friendship pool from Grimsby, I note that most of the letters after people's names are attached to the secondary school kids. 

And there's definitely no sense of deep-rooted failure in any of them.

When we have this big debate about bringing back grammars - a throwback - and carrying on with state secondaries - also a throwback - I can't help but feel we're missing the point and replaying that same old hackneyed upstairs/downstairs narrative.

Hasn't it been proved repeatedly that it's a poverty of ambition (or aspiration), generally resulting from ineffectual or disinterested parents, rather than the school system per se, that leads to the diversity of socio-economic outcomes we see?

And, as a development point, why isn't the debate about new forms of schooling including virtual schools, evening schools, 24/7 learning, mass online learning dissemination and the de-professionalisation of teaching towards learning facilitators? 

And how these models will deliver a school system that doesn't and shouldn't look like a throwback to schools that were conceived and built by people born in the 19th century? 

That's the really depressing thing about this debate.", Reply', Helen Gunter', September 12, 2016 at 13:54', The research evidence that underpins what Alan Johnson has to say is in Jackson and Marsden Education and Working Class from 1962. We knew then and we know now that selection of any sort (fees, faith, examinations, biology) does not work in the interests of the children or wider society. The restoration of grammar schools means that schools select children (and families) and not parents, and the evidence about this is in Chile. Here schools select children on the basis of examinations and observing them play; and on the basis of income as parents may be asked for additional funding to the taxpayer funded voucher, it is called co-payment. Now Chile is moving away from this as clearly it is exacerbating major social divisions.

', Comments', Jim G.', September 9, 2016 at 09:45', Yes, the exception does not prove the rule. The evidence is completely clear.', Reply', Iain Salisbury', September 10, 2016 at 10:05', Mary Dejevsky points out in "i" that, far from prompting social mobility, comprehensive schools have damaged the prospects for our most able pupils and actually made our top universities less inclusive.   She is surely correct to suggest that it's time to "bring back grammars."   While Ofsted Chief Inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw has sneered at their value to those who can't afford private education, he has also been savage in his recent criticism of the "under-achievement and unfulfilled potential" [1] of able pupils within the state system.   His Office has reported that students who attend grammar schools have a 57% chance of acquiring the highest grades at GCSE, while the figure for those with the same primary school performance sent to non-selective schools falls to 32% [2]. Part of the problem is that obliterating the grammars has not seen an influx of top graduates into the comprehensives but has simply lost them to education altogether.   Very considerable sums have been made available to recruit such people and questions have been asked in Parliament concerning the failure of these initiatives.   Once, grammar schools with sixth forms offered attractive careers to highly qualified graduates, anxious to teach well motivated pupils to the highest level.   Since this is no longer a significant option, it is increasingly the case that these people seek employment outside the school sector.    In half a century, comprehensives have done nothing positive for social mobility but have, indeed, made the country increasingly dependent on the private sector. Where else are you likely to find a linguist, these days?     It won't to appeal Mr. Johnson or to the other left-wing bigots who  have long had a stranglehold on the education establishment but it may be time to stop the ham-fisted attempts at social engineering and repurpose or schools towards education?

The case for progressivity is watertight. Value Added Tax, along with a rich diversity of other regressive impositions, is nothing other than a means of repression. On the one hand such taxes impede the upward mobility of those with little capital or none, while on the other they help facilitate a lower top rate of income tax and thereby an upward flow of wealth to the modern aristocracy. Such taxation is pernicious rather than economically necessary, and an enlightened administration that believed in a reasonable level of egalitarianism would have nothing to do with them. The outright abolition of regressive taxes would do more for the disadvantaged than any number of grammar schools.', Reply', Mark Kasozimusoke', September 10, 2016 at 14:42', A useful article by Alan Johnson. I fear that he is correct that the majority of children who do not jump the hurdle essentially suffer 'second class' provision even if the absurd "school uniform test" is abolished for the brightest poor children. Clearly what is required are more teachers, better teachers, more motivated teachers, better supported teachers, free thinking teachers and smaller class sizes. All of these can be found in the independent sector, good grammar schools and in 'leafy' suburban comprehensives. If you read May's speech it is astonishing in its breadth and depth. She mentions selection at 14 and 16 yrs which her critics never discuss. She mentions forcing independent schools to support state schools and challenges their rights to maintaining charitable status. She wants to pool teaching talent and would insist on wealthy schools offering classes for pupils from outside their school especially in the rarer, more esoteric subjects. She wants more capacity and does not shy away from the Cameroonian philosophy of state funding to 'free' schools. Some of this is repeat of Gove's ideas, some an extension. She even wants Catholics(even though she is Protestant) to extend their schools so that they can replicate their discipline. She is relaxed about more exclusive segregation based on religion if it means more provision of school places. This is particularly muddled thinking but at least it seems honest(if she actually wrote this part)... She talks about Universities having a commitment to assist bright, disadvantaged children. She mentions ways of trying to get around the middle class games of home tutors and the "house price catchment area". The body of the speech does not resemble the public persona of a stern, no nonsense Conservative. She talks of a pluralist utopia with choice and provision for all classes and creeds. It is all laudable but equally laughable in that her vision is unobtainable and the missing words - "government investment" are relatively conspicuous by their absence. The relentless focus on grammar schools is wrong and an unnecessary distraction but after all she is a politician; so she must 'play to the gallery' and appease some supporters as well as appearing tough on some of her own....', Reply', John A.', October 1, 2016 at 07:10', "She even wants Catholics (even though she is Protestant) to extend their schools so that they can replicate their discipline." Only an exceptional prime minister will want to do away with the inculcation of superstition into children.', Reply', Hugh B', September 10, 2016 at 11:42', One or two experiences and so me hearsay does not make a comeback nvincing case. After a question after of a century teaching, I can only report that my time and n a grammar school has afforded me experience, time after time, of young people from perfectly ordinary and quite often deeply deprived backgrounds riding to become confident, able and successful people. The "expensive grammar school uniform" is no more costly than the comprehensive or even primary school uniforms in my borough of London, either. In any case, since when is the cost of a uniform an argument about education? This kind of argument is not only intellectually dishonest, it casts the entrance test as a boundary between success in life and failure. That is arrant nonsense: if you go to the comprehensive schools in a district that has grammar schools, you will not find teacher's who treat their students as failures. On the contrary, teachers will strive to raise them to the highest level that is possible. Why not write disparagingly about Russell Group universities or Oxbridge? No; calling children failures if they don't get into a grammar school is what  is regressive. A responsible education system would work vigorously on the premise that different schools are different paths to success. And the main culprit here is the socially accepted belief that being a doctor is more 'successful ' than being a builder. Responsible media would  desist from implying that comprehensive education is inferior by calling selective education 'unfair'.', Reply', Stuart C.', September 12, 2016 at 10:55', u"Thanks for this piece Alan. As a primary state-schooled kid who passed the 11+and went to a country grammar, I've always found it difficult to look at grammar schools and see them as anything but great for those inside the gates. 

Because - and I know this isn't true for everyone but it certainly was for myself and my school friends - grammar school was a really great thing. You were part of something, something historic, and everyone about you knew how to learn - in whatever fields they were interested in. And perhaps more than that they tended to have the confidence and the necessary energy (qi) to make the day happen. Carpe diem and all that.

That said, my friends from home - who all went to secondary moderns - were all pretty pleased with themselves, and when I look at the doctors and directors from that tiny, unpromising friendship pool from Grimsby, I note that most of the letters after people's names are attached to the secondary school kids. 

And there's definitely no sense of deep-rooted failure in any of them.

When we have this big debate about bringing back grammars - a throwback - and carrying on with state secondaries - also a throwback - I can't help but feel we're missing the point and replaying that same old hackneyed upstairs/downstairs narrative.

Hasn't it been proved repeatedly that it's a poverty of ambition (or aspiration), generally resulting from ineffectual or disinterested parents, rather than the school system per se, that leads to the diversity of socio-economic outcomes we see?

And, as a development point, why isn't the debate about new forms of schooling including virtual schools, evening schools, 24/7 learning, mass online learning dissemination and the de-professionalisation of teaching towards learning facilitators? 

And how these models will deliver a school system that doesn't and shouldn't look like a throwback to schools that were conceived and built by people born in the 19th century? 

That's the really depressing thing about this debate.", Reply', Helen Gunter', September 12, 2016 at 13:54', The research evidence that underpins what Alan Johnson has to say is in Jackson and Marsden Education and Working Class from 1962. We knew then and we know now that selection of any sort (fees, faith, examinations, biology) does not work in the interests of the children or wider society. The restoration of grammar schools means that schools select children (and families) and not parents, and the evidence about this is in Chile. Here schools select children on the basis of examinations and observing them play; and on the basis of income as parents may be asked for additional funding to the taxpayer funded voucher, it is called co-payment. Now Chile is moving away from this as clearly it is exacerbating major social divisions.
