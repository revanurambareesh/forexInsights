                	', The assumptions/anchoring (delete depending on your level of cynicism) in Boris\u2019 speech is remarkable. Let\u2019s re-frame things so that they have some relationship with the real world. ', 
', \u2013 Just calling something a taboo doesn\u2019t make it so. There\u2019s nothing taboo about academic selection. Smart people realised it\u2019s just a bad idea and so we\u2019ve stopped doing it.', 
', \u2013 Grammar schools don\u2019t increase social mobility \u2013 particularly when the average intake is about 2% FSM. They give an even bigger leg up to the already privileged.    ', 
', \u2013 Eton doesn\u2019t have a monopoly on \u2018helping people succeed in the future.\u2019 It does have a monopoly on educating the richest people in the country. Some application of cause and effect is badly needed on this one.  ', 
', Now that\u2019s out of the way here is where the debate should be. ', 
', \u2013 Focussing our efforts on helping 2% of poor kids do better at the expense of the rest is lazy and morally indefensible. To quote someone smarter than me \u2018it\u2019s like giving the 2% of people hit by a famine tickets for dinner at the Ritz.\u2019', 
', If Boris is serious about devolving education powers to London he needs to educate himself pretty quickly. This speech is the probably best reason to keep the decisions as far away from City Hall as possible.',

                	', The assumptions/anchoring (delete depending on your level of cynicism) in Boris\u2019 speech is remarkable. Let\u2019s re-frame things so that they have some relationship with the real world. ', 
', \u2013 Just calling something a taboo doesn\u2019t make it so. There\u2019s nothing taboo about academic selection. Smart people realised it\u2019s just a bad idea and so we\u2019ve stopped doing it.', 
', \u2013 Grammar schools don\u2019t increase social mobility \u2013 particularly when the average intake is about 2% FSM. They give an even bigger leg up to the already privileged.    ', 
', \u2013 Eton doesn\u2019t have a monopoly on \u2018helping people succeed in the future.\u2019 It does have a monopoly on educating the richest people in the country. Some application of cause and effect is badly needed on this one.  ', 
', Now that\u2019s out of the way here is where the debate should be. ', 
', \u2013 Focussing our efforts on helping 2% of poor kids do better at the expense of the rest is lazy and morally indefensible. To quote someone smarter than me \u2018it\u2019s like giving the 2% of people hit by a famine tickets for dinner at the Ritz.\u2019', 
', If Boris is serious about devolving education powers to London he needs to educate himself pretty quickly. This speech is the probably best reason to keep the decisions as far away from City Hall as possible.',
