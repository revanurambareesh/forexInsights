This provides key competitive advantages with respect to carrying out high quality research, joint programming and securing international funding. The further expansion of the existing APC Microbiome Institute/Teagasc (Moorepark) facility to become a centralised Irish Sequencing Centre, through purchase of an Illumina NextSeq, will considerably benefit Irish research institutes and industry.',

', The Open Ocean Emulator (OOE) integrates test tank developments, state-of-the-art instrumentation and electrical infrastructure such that to create the most advanced small scale model testing capability worldwide.  It will complement existing facilities at Lir-NOTF, UCC and enhance Irelands R&D capacity, particularly at the MaREI Centre.  The OOE will accurately replicate real ocean wave conditions in a laboratory setting and in combination with the use of advanced instrumentation will improve our understanding on how marine structures, such as wave energy convertors, floating wind turbines and tidal energy devices, behave.  This advanced testing capability will accelerate the path from technology design to real-world applications and contribute to the growth and sustainability of the offshore renewable energy industry in Ireland.  ',

', The GeoRise is a special type of scanning electron microscope, which geoscientists will use to investigate real-world sized rocks at sub-microscopic scale. This cutting edge analytical instrument will have a wide array of detectors that allow the simultaneous determination of many properties, such as composition, luminescence and atomic arrangement. The GeoRise also has software that can automatically recognise groups of minerals within a rock and map their mutual relationships. Most importantly, the GeoRise can quantify the content of valuable metals in rocks in unprecedented detail. It will thus be used to develop new approaches to resource and energy efficiency.',

', Ireland has an ocean territory ten times larger than its terrestrial landmass. Geological, oceanographic and biological processes mutually interact on a daily basis in this vast territory. Continuously recording offshore sensors are required to monitor this activity. Here we establish the ', Insit,  Marine Laboratory for Geosystems Research (iMARL) comprising Ocean Bottom Seismographs (OBSs), Temperature and Acoustic Recorders. Strapped to sea-bed landers and deployed on the sea floor this equipment will allow for the detections of offshore earthquakes and offshore storms, as well as noise in the ocean and biologically generated  acoustic signals (e.g. from whales). Impacts include: natural resources quantification, natural hazard estimation, environmental and baseline climate related ', insitu ', ocean monitoring.  A pilot tsunami detection system will also be installed as part of the network.',

', The Irish Atmospheric Simulation Chamber (IASC) is a new national facility specially designed to support world-leading research activities in the key strategic areas of atmospheric and materials science. Based at University College Cork (UCC), the IASC Facility will consist of a large custom-built chamber equipped with cutting-edge instrumentation to enable innovative studies on air pollution and climate change. It will also serve as an advanced testbed for novel atmospheric monitoring techniques, emerging sensor technologies and depolluting materials. The facility will promote new research synergies, increase Irish competitiveness in the European Research Area, while also impacting strongly on environment, health and the economy in Irish society.',
