', About Us', The development of personal dignity and ability in each child \u2013 no matter how young \u2013 is one of the most valuable and permanent benefits of Montessori education. Vruksha caters to the emotional and educational needs of the child from 2 years.', 
', 
', Montessori', Montessori World School classrooms are equipped with materials designed to address particular developmental needs of children at different ages. Dr. Montessori created activities that identify and sequence the steps children go through as they work to achieve each educational outcome.', 
', 
', IGCSE', Cambridge International Examinations prepares school students for life, helping them develop an informed curiosity and a lasting passion for learning. We are part of Cambridge Assessment, a department of the University of Cambridge.', 
', 
', 
', \u201cAny child is self-sufficient, who can tie his shoes, dress or undress himself, reflects in his joy and sense of achievement the image of human dignity, which is derived from a sense of independence.\u201d', 
', 
', \u201cThe environment must be rich in motives which lend interest to activity and invite the child to conduct his own experiences.\u201d',
