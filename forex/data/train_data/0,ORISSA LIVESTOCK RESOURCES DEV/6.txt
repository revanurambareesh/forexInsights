ORISSA STATE LIVESTOCK SECTOR POLICY
October 2002
1. Current Policy Environment
The Orissa Government Policy on Agriculture Development, including Livestock
seeks to ensure the welfare of the vast majority of its people living in the rural areas and
stresses social justice and equality of opportunity as important considerations in the
development strategy. Within the confines of this basic objective, the state\u2019s policy intends in
general to build a progressively modern and dynamic agricultural livestock economy in the
state leading to improved employment potential, increased income, self-sufficiency in food
and food security for the state. During the past five decades of the planned development era
post independence, the state however, has operated pretty much without a comprehensive
policy framework in the Agriculture and Livestock sectors. The state formulated its first
comprehensive Agricultural policy framework, including a component of Animal Husbandry,
only in 1996.
Livestock sector in Orissa is highly livelihood intensive and over 80 per cent of its
rural households own livestock of one species or the other and earn supplementary incomes
from them. Livestock holding is less iniquitous than land holding and income from livestock is
more equitably distributed. The sector contributes 7.25 per cent of the state\u2019s net domestic
product and , therefore , development of the livestock sector is the critical pathway to rural
prosperity. However, livestock sector policy so far, had only a marginal presence in the
sectoral economy and the policies , in general, have failed to galvanise purposeful action.
The Government of Orissa, therefore, appointed a high-powered Steering Committee
in 1998 to make a comprehensive review of the state livestock sector and to recommend
new policy directions in order to enable the State Government to formulate a new Livestock
Sector Policy Framework. The Steering Committee felt that, in the wake of the changing
economic policies nationally and globally, the state livestock sector policy has to take a more
holistic view of the sector and find ways of catalyzing rapid economic growth and
development in the decades to come. The Steering Committee recommended that the State
should formulate a comprehensive new policy framework for its Livestock Sector in order to
help the sector to play its appointed role in the development of the state in the decades to
come. These proposals for a new policy framework are based on the recommendations of
the Steering Committee.
2. Goals of New Livestock Sector Policy
On the basis of the livestock sector review 1999, it is apparent that the over-arching
goals that Orissa\u2019s new livestock sector policy should pursue, shall be:
2.1. Use the livestock sector as an engine for the social and economic development
of the rural population enabling steady growth of rural household income,
increasing rural employment opportunities and improved quality of life, cutting
across caste, class and gender.
2.2. Enable the small producers to actively participate in the process of
development and equip them with information, skills and technologies to
transform the growing challenges of the market place, into comparative and
competitive advantages through improved livestock quality and higher
productivity.

2.3. Ensure the ecological and environmental sustainability of the livestock sector
growth and modernization; constantly monitoring the environmental impact of
the growth process and designing policies and programmes to effectively
mitigate their adverse impact.
2.4. To capacitate the marginalized sections, especially women, SCs and STs with
supplementary inputs and services, so that they are enabled to have equal
access to the opportunities offered under this new livestock development and
management policy.
For achieving the proposed policy goals, the Department of Fisheries and Animal
Resources Development (FARD), the administrative and nodal Department in the State
Government for Livestock Development, will interact and liaise with other State Departments
like Agriculture, Cooperation, Finance, Planning & Coordination, Revenue, Forest &
Environment, Rural Development and Panchayat Raj, Labour & Employment and with the
Government of India.
The Department of FARD will co-ordinate interaction between Government and
Industry, between Cooperatives, NGOs and Private Enterprises, between Research
Establishment and Industry and among a host of other actors whose actions will shape
Orissa\u2019s competitive advantage. The most decisive role for the Government is to design a
policy framework for the livestock sector for the coming decades and of orchestrating the
actions of the multitude of actors involved in the sector.
3. Proposed Policy Framework and Strategies
Orissa\u2019s New Livestock Sector Policy Framework is proposed along the following
Seven Key Thrust Areas:
3.1 Capacitate and equip the rural poor to use livestock production as the
instrument to enhance household income, supplement family nutrition and to
protect rural livelihood systems, giving special emphasis to women.
Livestock production in Orissa is predominantly the endeavour of the small holders.
Marginal and small farmers account for some 80 per cent of the total operational holdings.
Together with the landless they own 60 per cent of the milch animals, 55 per cent of the
draught animals, 75 per cent of the poultry, over 80 per cent of the goat and almost the
entire sheep and pig populations and over half of them live below the poverty line. Women
play a crucial role in the day to day management of livestock.
Income from livestock is therefore a substantial supplement to the overwhelmingly
subsistence farming systems in rural Orissa. Enabling them to maximize livestock income
can make all the difference between subsistence and progressively viable farming systems.
A critical role the Government proposes to play, therefore, is to help them maximize returns
on hitherto free resources of crop residues, grazing and family labour. For this several
specific policies are proposed.
3.1(a) Redesign and reconfigure the input delivery service under the Government to
serve as a protective armour around the small producers and their subsistence
farming systems.
Animal health care and breeding services are the two most important services that
the state now provides free to the livestock producers. Improving the quality of these
 
  ', 
  ', 
      ', 
        5.
      ', 
    5
services and their usefulness to the producers is the prime consideration under the new
policy. There is increasing evidence that farmers prefer good quality paid services to poor
quality free service.
In order to make these services improve their quality, reach out to the farmers whom
it seeks to serve and becomes accountable, the Government will progressively make
veterinary and artificial insemination services, mobile practices operating within their existing
jurisdictions and delivering the services at the farmers door-step, as paid inputs. Under the
new policy the Government will permit the Government employed Veterinarians, Livestock
Inspectors and Inseminators to practice their profession / trade and to charge for the
services delivered at the farmers\u2019 door-step at market rates. These reforms will be
implemented in a phased manner; first in well developed areas, which can absorb the
change and work it to their advantage. Extension of the policy and introduction of the new
delivery systems in other areas will follow an economic change scale.
3.1(b) Equip and empower the small producers with information and skills to
maximize returns, through appropriate technologies and self help approach to
problem solving.
There are many services and inputs needed by livestock owners in the day to day
management of their livestock enterprise and most of these do not need the services of a
qualified Veterinarian or Livestock Inspector. The magnitude of the task is so large that the
only solution is to create such skills among the users \u2013 the small holders themselves- in their
villages. The tasks are veterinary first aid, vaccination of birds and animals, ecto and endo
parasite control, innovative feed supplementing techniques, shelter innovations and candling
of desi eggs for hatching. These are all simple skills needed in villages constantly. Young
men and women from the small holder households can be trained to practise these skills,
provide service to the small holders and even earn a small income for their services,
addressing men and women equally.
3.1(c ) Promote and nurture grass root level participatory bodies all over the state, as
the organic link between the Animal Husbandry Department and the small
holders.
Just as in the case of inputs and services to the scattered small holders, training
them for various skills required for the day-to-day management of their livestock enterprise,
is also a task outside the size and scope of the State Department of Fisheries and Animal
Resources Development The Department\u2019s task is to assess and quantify the training
needs, to structure and package the training programmes and to farm them out to grass root
level bodies all over the state for implementation.
Several forms of such grass root level bodies are possible: Producers Co-operatives,
Breeders\u2019 Associations, Self Help Groups and Voluntary Organizations. These organizations
can form the organic link between the Department and the small holders as well as the
conduit for transfer of technologies, skill training, extension support and even inputs.
The Government and the Department will kick start the movement of promoting
grass roots bodies in a few chosen districts and nurture them as live models for other
districts and areas to follow on their own. The Government would encourage and support
local initiative in building up such organizations / groups, in any area in the state. A budget
for structuring and promoting the organic link would be a part of the policy implications.

3.2 Promote adoption of appropriate technologies, enhance productivity, increase
effectiveness and ensure returns proportionate to the investment of time,
energy and resources that small holders, particularly women, make for
livestock development and management.
Government policy would focus on aggressive strategies to integrate the small
producer in the larger process of sectoral growth. A critical area for experimentation and
promotion towards this is the intermediate production system, which enables the small
holder to gradually integrate the highly productive modern technology and management into
his traditional system. Introducing half bred milch animals into the traditional small holder
households is an excellent example for the intermediate production system, which not only
gives some high production features, but also preserves some of the ruggedness of the local
animals he is used to. There are many others like this involving other species of livestock
and poultry.
These intermediate production systems depend on high technologies like Artificial
Insemination (AI), the most critical tool that the science has given to animal production.
Orissa is yet to exploit the tool to the full advantage of its many milk producers, in spite of
establishing very large infrastructure and skill pool. Restructuring the management of the AI
system is the critical reform for establishing intermediate production systems. The new
livestock sector policy seeks to transfer the task of generating high quality AI inputs like
genetically evaluated AI bulls, frozen semen and liquid nitrogen and their supply to all AI
practitioners, to a new organization, incorporated as a registered society, \u201cThe Orissa
Livestock Resources Development Society\u201d. AI delivery itself will be reorganized as mobile
service delivering a vastly improved AI service at the farmers\u2019 door-step.
Graded pigs with exotic donors for higher body weights, moving in genetically
selected bucks and rams for goat and sheep breeding into small holder units for selective
breeding and custom bred desi breeding cocks for the backyard poultry are other examples
for engineering intermediate production systems in small holdings.
To promote intermediate production system, Government will mobilize credit through
commercial banks for mini dairy schemes, small animals and poultry schemes. There will
also be a subsidy package similar to the Government of India scheme \u201cSpecial Livestock
Breeding Programme\u201d (SLBP), along with concessional credit scheme for the bottom end of
the small holder spectrum.
3.3 Encourage growth and modernization of the livestock sector in a well balanced
format where all species of livestock are allowed to grow and develop in
proportion to their livelihood intensity and potential to enhance livelihoods;
not merely in proportion to their population size.
Development of the livestock sector in Orissa so far, had largely been monopolized
by the bovine. Sheep, goat, pig and poultry are far more livelihood intensive and are owned
by the bottom end of the small holder households. The new livestock sector policy will
incorporate adequate safe guards to balance the species wise outlay of the State and
Central plan, largely in proportion to the livelihood implication of these species of livestock.
These interventions actually will comprise measures for (i) skill training, subsidies for
acquiring breeding stock like genetically selected cocks for the backyard system, bucks,
rams and boars for goat, sheep and pig breeding respectively; and concessional credit for
household level enterprises, on one plane; (ii) breeding and selection programmes for all
species, on the second and (iii) aggressive promotional activities for building up an organic
link of peoples\u2019 bodies outside the Government, so essential for the sub sector, on the third
plane.

3.4 Resolute direct action by the Government in such areas as disease control and
eradication and quality control mechanisms.
Curative veterinary care generates only private good while prevention and control of
animal diseases generates enormous public good to the advantage of the state and the
nation as a whole. Control of diseases will reduce the yield gap and cut down the annuals
losses due to diseases - Rs.2.5 billion - in the case of Orissa. Under the new livestock policy,
public funds will increasingly be directed towards public good disease prevention and control
and less for curative veterinary care.
The new livestock policy will enable the launch of a state wide FMD control
programme as part of a national control programme, an active and responsive disease
reporting system and disease containment zone in the most productive areas in the state.
3.5 Devise ways to ensure that the sector grows with the active and gainful
participation of the resource poor throughout the state.
For quite some time to come, the State Government needs to devise and implement
specific policies and programmes to enable the small holders to progressively approach
viable levels of efficiency and output, through better access to credit, better quality credit and
some subsidy support.
The Government is not in favour of subsidy as an instrument of development but
under the prevailing poverty scenario it will develop a creative policy to generate positive
response which will not be antithetical to the interest of the resource poor, progress and
efficiency and by which the small holders will progressively reach viable levels of efficiency
and output with access to better quality credit and subsidy support.
The State will have two kinds of credit inflow for the livestock sector :
a) Commercial Credit for the upper end of the smallholder producers engaged in livestock
enterprises to enable them to move into intermediate production system.
b) A concessional and liberalised credit scheme for the bottom half of the small holder
spectrum, in the IRDP format, to enable them to move above the poverty line and to
achieve the efficiency levels for entering into intermediate systems.
3.6 Ensure the ecological and environmental sustainability of livestock sector
growth and modernization; mitigating their adverse impact through
appropriate policies and programmes.
The very large and growing population of bovine is a major threat to sustainability of
all animals and agriculture in Orissa. Reduction in cattle numbers is possible only if the
dependence on draught animals for farm power declines. The new livestock policy will
encourage a set of measures to reduce the dependence on draught animals for farm power
and to reduce their numbers: (i) Optimal sharing of work animals by farmers; (ii) Improved
quality of work animals through grading up of local animals with Haryana breed; (iii)
Vigorously encouraging lease markets for work animals, promoting team labour and (iv)
Encouraging establishment of agro-service centres in major villages, enabling custom hiring
of farm machinery and tractors.
Another major ecological concern is the deterioration of common property resources.
The problem of designing the interface between livestock owners and common property
resources is complex and intractable. For the new livestock policy it makes best sense to
 
  ', 
  ', 
      ', 
        8.
      ', 
    8
encourage and support a variety of experiments and approaches to: (i) generate alternatives
that reduce pressure on rural people to pursue livelihood strategies detrimental to their
habitat and (ii) promote symbiotic and synergetic relationships between local communities
and their environment, through participatory natural resource management.
3.7 Restructure and revitalize existing institutional set up in the livestock sector,
enhance institution level efficiency and promote new institutional models to
handle the emerging challenges in sector development.
Under the regime of the new policy, two major initiatives are proposed: (i) existing
institutional structure will be reoriented and geared up to play a far bigger and demanding
role, partly through restructuring and partly by redefining its mission; and (ii) there are many
tasks that need to be performed, for which the best strategy would be to promote institutions
outside the Government.
The mandate of the Department of Fisheries and Animal Resources Development
under the new policy would be: (i) Control, containment and eradication of animal diseases;
and (ii) Livestock sector development. Department will progressively move away from
delivery of veterinary care and AI services, first converting them into mobile practices;
gradually retreating towards the privatization of the services. The Department will have a
bipolar structure, reflecting the mandate - one group engaged in disease control and the
other in livestock development. Disease control will be the direct action by the Department;
but for livestock development the Department will work in a participatory format. The
Department\u2019s training capacity will be geared up to cater to the needs of intensified
participatory extension service and empowerment of Non-Governmental Organisations
active in livestock development.
The development tasks under the new policy will necessitate the promotion of a new
autonomous body \u201cthe Orissa Livestock Resource Development Society\u201d (OLRDS), a
registered society under the Societies Act, which will take over all the AI infrastructure,
except the field AI centers. It will generate all the genetic inputs for breeding of cattle and
buffalo and will establish a state-wide infrastructure for the distributed bulk movement and
bulk storage of liquid nitrogen. Frozen semen and liquid nitrogen will be delivered to all AI
practitioners at their doorstep by the OLRDS, against payment.
The Orissa State Cooperative Milk Producers Federation (OMFED) and the milk
unions affiliated to it will be re-promoted with greater autonomy, greater member control and
reduced Government interventions in order to enable it to pursue its charter and business
interest as a commercial enterprise of producer members.
The Utkal Gomangal Samiti (UGS) will take up larger responsibilities in promoting
natural breeding service and use of cross bred bullocks.
The Orissa State Poultry Products Co-operative Marketing Federation (OPOLFED)
will be re -promoted as a development co -operative to take up the responsibility of supplying
the genetic inputs and appropriate technologies for the backyard poultry system in addition
to assisting small producers to market their products.
The Orissa University of Agriculture and Technology (OUAT) through its constituent
colleges will provide necessary technical input and guidance in matters relating to overall
livestock sectoral growth.
Agricultural Promotion and Investment Corporation of Orissa Ltd. (APICOL) will
promote dairy and poultry industries on commercial scale through entrepreneurship
development programme. A food processing unit will be within the ambit of its objective.

District Rural Development Agency (DRDA) / Zilla Parishad will disseminate
developmental work under Animal Husbandry sector at grass root level under Panchayat Raj
System.
Breeders Associations, Voluntary Agencies and Non-Governmental Organisations
will be promoted to activate the grass root level bodies and for imparting training and transfer
of skills as may be defined by the State Government.
4. Perspective Plan for Livestock Development in Orissa.
The proposed policy framework will be translated into specific actions through a ten
year perspective plan for the development of livestock in the State. The plan covers all
species of livestock including poultry and spans a ten year period from 2002 to 2012
for implementation in two phases, each of five years: Phase I \u2013 2002-2007 and Phase II
\u2013 2007-2012.
The Government of India is in the process of giving final approvals for the \u201cNational
Project for Cattle and Buffalo Breeding\u201d which more or less overlaps the state development
plan discussed here and it has many commonalities with the cattle and buffalo breeding part
of this plan. The strategies and action plan for cattle and buffalo breeding in both are
therefore identical and the state plan is designed to merge with the national project and to
receive full funding for it from the national project.
The action plan under the state livestock development plan (SLDP) is designed area
and species specific, staggering the implementation process in consonance with the
development status of the area and ability of the farming community there to absorb the
changes to their advantage. All the 30 districts in the state are grouped into three categories:
Category A \u2013 most potential; B - Potential and C \u2013 least potential, based on several criteria
specifically relevant to dairy production. The typification of areas of development of other
species is on the basis of specific animal population size, households owning the different
species of livestock and production aggregates of livestock produce.
The plan will be implemented in the state by a consortium of implementing agencies,
the State Department of Fisheries and Animal Resources Development; the proposed
\u201cOrissa Livestock Resource Development Society\u201d, the Orissa State Milk Producers\u2019
Cooperative Federation, the Utkal Gomangal Samiti, the Orissa State Poultry Products Co-
operative Marketing Federation and other agencies like Non Governmental Organisations
(NGOs), Voluntary Organisations (VOs), Bilateral / Multilateral Assistance Projects, etc.,
that the Government of Orissa designates as \u201cImplementing Agencies\u201d.
Project funding will come from two major sources: State Plan and Non-plan Budgets,
Central Plan Assistance and Institutional Finance. The major investment for cattle and
buffalo breeding component will be sourced from the Central Project for Cattle and Buffalo
Breeding.
4.1 Action Plan for Cattle and Buffalo Breeding in Orissa.
The plan will progressively bring under organized breeding operations increasing
numbers of adult female populations of cattle and buffalo during the 10th
year plan period
2002-2007, 50 per cent of the indigenous cattle, 70 per cent of the cross bred cattle and 40
per cent of the buffaloes.
The development tasks under the cattle and buffalo development plan are :

(b) Convert in a phased manner all the Government AI centers to mobile AI practices and
allow the Government employed inseminators to practise doorstep delivery of AI as a
paid service.
(c) Conversion of the DCS (Dairy Co-operative Society) based AI centers in the milk
cooperative sector into cluster AI practices covering about six society villages under
each cluster practice; and start new, mobile cluster AI practices to bring all the DCSs
under AI coverage.
(d) New stationary AI centers will be opened under the Department in B and C category
districts to intensify breeding coverage.
(e) Set up mobile AI practice by trained private AI practitioners in large numbers, to expand
the coverage of breeding female cattle and buffalo; and to deliver AI at the farmers door
step as a paid service.

(f) In areas inaccessible and unsuitable for AI, selected bulls will be strategically stationed
for natural service.
(g) Expand and strengthen the existing two frozen semen production stations at Cuttack and
Bhawanipatna and establish a new Frozen Semen Production Station at Chipilima to
enhance production of frozen semen.
(h) Strengthen all existing semen banks and establish new semen banks to enhance
distributed storage of frozen semen and liquid nitrogen, and delivery of both to all AI
practitioners.
(i) Establish infrastructure for the bulk movement and distributed bulk storage of liquid
nitrogen in the state and manage the liquid nitrogen delivery system.
(j) Strengthen the training facilities in the state and initiate refresher training of all the in-
service Inseminators and start basic training of new mobile AI practitioners.
(k) Set in motion a quality assurance programme covering all aspects of the AI service in
the state: Bulls, Semen, Semen Production Stations and AI Service across the board.
(l) Establish systematic field performance recording programmes and progeny testing of AI
bulls as a regular and continuing requirement for bull selection.
Breeding policy for the cattle under the project will be:
a) In order to improve the body size and body weight of the local cattle both for producing
good work animals as well as a good foundation stock for cross breeding, Haryana
breed will be used only for upgrading Binjharpuri Cattle and nondescript animals of
relatively larger size available for any other areas. In the districts like Kalahandi,
Nuapada & Koraput, short statured cattle are generally used for draught purposes.
These cattle are used to pull bullock carts with wheels of smaller size. It will, therefore,
be desirable to use Red Sindhi to upgrade these cattle for producing dual purpose
progenies.
b) For milch animal production, it will be necessary to upgrade the local cattle with exotic
bulls. Jersey and Holstein will be used as improver breeds. However, looking to climatic
condition of the state and taking economic condition of the farmers into consideration,
Jersey has been anticipated as the breed of choice for large scale cross breeding of the
local cattle. Holstein, however, can be used as improver breed only in limited areas
where ambient temperature does not go very high, i.e. beyond 40º C and the farmers are
resourceful to provide feed and other inputs to the Holstein cross breeds.
c) The inter se mating population should be of exotic & local bulls. This will avoid
procurement of large number of exotic and Haryana bulls and also local half breds will
be more adoptive.
d) Murrah buffalo bulls can be used for upgrading the local buffaloes for producing dual
purpose animals (milch and draught). In order to maintain and conserve local breeds for
buffaloes, certain areas in the breeding tracts of Parlakhemundi, Sambalpur and Chilika
may be earmarked for selective breeding by using selected buffaloes bulls of respective
breeds.
e) In order to preserve the native breeds (germplasm) like Binjharpuri, Ghumsari, Motu etc.
in their home tracts from its extinction / dilution, efforts should be made to preserve
them.

f) Research on breeding of cows and buffaloes and performance of the progenies may be
taken up.
g) The maximum level of exotic blood be preferably maintained at 62.5%.
Project Implementation
Four implementing agencies will be involved with project implementation in addition
to any voluntary agencies and bilateral projects designated by the Government of Orissa: (i)
the Orissa Livestock Resource Development Society (OLRDS), (ii) the Department of
Fisheries and ARD, (iii) the Orissa State Co-operative Milk Producers Federation (OMFED),
and (iv) the Utkal Gomangal Samiti.
The OLRDS will be the principal implementing agency for the cattle and buffalo
breeding plan. It will generate all the genetic inputs for breeding like evaluated bulls, frozen
semen, liquid nitrogen and will deliver the semen and liquid nitrogen to all AI practitioners in
the state, on a regular, systematic and continued basis. All infrastructures for AI except the
field AI centers will be transferred to the society. The Society will establish additional
facilities needed.
The Department of Fisheries and ARD will continue to own and operate all the AI
centres, but will progressively convert them into mobile practices delivering AI at the farmers
door-step. The Department will train Inseminators and all Inseminators under all agencies
practising AI in the state will be tested and licensed by the Department.
The OMFED will convert all the existing DCS AI centers into mobile cluster AI
practices to bring all DCSs under AI coverage. The OMFED and the milk unions will carry
out the field recording programme for progeny testing on behalf of the OLRDS and will be
reimbursed all costs for the programme by OLRDS.
The Utkal Gomangal Samiti will be responsible for launching a large Natural Service
(NS) Bull programme for providing breeding facilities in villages where AI is not feasible.
They will select and raise the Haryana, cross bred and Murrah bulls required for the NS
Scheme. The UGS will also launch a promotion and rearing programme for popularizing
cross bred bullocks among the farming community.
4.2 Meat Animal Development Plan
Meat animals in Orissa are sheep, goat and pig. Cattle are used for meat only to a
very small extent and come under the cattle and buffalo development plan. Poultry are dealt
with separately under poultry development plan.
Recommended breeding policy for sheep and goat is selective breeding within the
existing distinctive Orissa breeds of sheep and goat as they have sufficient potential for
improvement in body weight and meat output through selective breeding.
Recommended breeding policy for pig is cross breeding of local pig with Large White
Yorkshire / Charmukha and use of cross bred boars for grading up. In well endowed areas
and in progressive farms, progressive grading upwith the exotic breeds is recommended.
 
  ', 
  ', 
      ', 
        13.
      ', 
    13
Large scale promotion of breeding stock production for sheep and goat through large
and medium farmers and promotion of breeders associations for input supply, training and
extension are the components of meat animal development plan. The OUAT in the
Department of Animal Breeding and Genetics will have a pragmatic and comprehensive
technical programme and selection parameters for launching of a massive breeding stock of
Duck, Doe, Ram and Ewe. Experience of Maharastra in boar breeding will also be taken into
account.
Sheep and Goat development programmes will focus on districts: Sheep: Keonjhar,
Mayurbhanj, Bolangir, Gnajam and Kalahandi; Goat: Sundargarh, Mayurbhanj, Keonjhar,
Balasore, Bolangir and Ganjam. The proposed programmes are: Promotional programmes
for development and supply of breeding rams and bucks through selected breeders, Skill
training of rural technicians and promotion of Breeders\u2019 Association, Self-help groups,
Voluntary and non-Governmental organizations. There will also be a supporting and subsidy
component in the programmes.
For pig development the focus districts will be: Sundargarh, Mayurbhanj, Koraput,
Subarnapur, Malkangiri, Rayagada and Keonjhar. The thrust programme is promotion,
development and supply of cross bred and graded breeding boars and supporting credit and
subsidy.
4.3 Poultry Development Plan
Poultry development plan focuses on the desi fowls in the backyard units which
account for over 80 per cent of all fowls in the state. The organized poultry industry in the
state is capable of meeting all their development needs through the industry itself and needs
only enabling policy support from the Government.
The recommended breeding policy for backyard poultry is selective breeding in
organized farms for large scale generation of breeding stock, particularly cocks for supply to
the backyard units. The goal is for improving the growth rate and body weight without
compromising the current levels of egg production.
The six state poultry farms will be transferred to the OPOLFED and the OPOLFED
will be responsible for starting in collaboration with the Department of Fisheries and ARD
and the OUAT a selection programme based on sire family selection. The OPOLFED will
raise a large number of breeding cocks and hens and will supply them to the backyard units
at market price, as two-week-old chicks. Emphasis will also be laid to experiment Australian
variety basing on the experience of cyclone ravaged areas where a sizeable number of such
cocks were distributed. The recommended breeding policy for backyard poultry through
selective breeding in origanised farms will be taken up.
The other inputs needed by the backyard system are vaccination and extension
support. A poultry breeders\u2019 association will be promoted to look after the extension support
and development of the desi birds. The association will also arrange skill training with the
help of the Department and self help groups in the villages.
Districts chosen for focused action for backyard poultry development programmes
are: Koraput, Mayurbhanj, Ganjam, Keonjhar, Sundargarh and Balasore. The programmes
are: promoting a poultry breeders\u2019 association, promotion of Non Governmental
Organizations and Self Help Groups for training and technology transfer, promotion of
genetic inputs, subsidies and credit for backyard system.

5. Development plan for Animal Health Care Services
Under the new livestock policy, the overall role of the Department and its mandate
will be redefined to focus on prevention and control of animal diseases; and livestock
development. Delivery of services like veterinary care and artificial insemination will be
reconfigured into mobile practices and later would give way to professional practice
delivering the input at the farmers\u2019 door-step as paid services.
5.1 Veterinary Service
This change over in veterinary service delivery however will be gradual over a 25
year period. As a first step the veterinary hospitals, dispensaries and livestock aid centres in
selected districts will be converted into mobile practices delivering the services at the
farmers door step. The veterinary and the para-veterinary officers involved in the mobile
practice will be allowed to treat door-step delivery of services as a private arrangement
between the practitioner and the farmer. The practitioners will continue to be employees of
the Government of Orissa in the Department of Fisheries and ARD and will receive all their
emoluments, allowances and perks till they superannuate.
The programmes for animal health care comprise 1) the conversion of the veterinary
hospitals, dispensaries and livestock aid centres into mobile practice veterinary and AI
services delivery, 2) the capital grants required to equip the veterinarians and the
inseminators, and 3) re-equipping these institutions to handle the changed system. Due
emphasis will be given for animal health insurance coverage.
User charges will be collected for vaccination / AI / diagnostic services and feed
analytical services etc. as prescribed by the State Govt. from time to time. User charges will
be spent in the same districts in which it is collected to improve the quality of service delivery
without any diversion to other districts. State level institutions like Orissa Biological Products
Institution (OBPI) and OLRDS etc. should get share of user charges at agreed percentages.
5.2 FMD Control Programme
The State Government in consultation with the Central Government and the
Governments of the neighbouring states will draw up a State Foot and Mouth Prevention,
Control and Containment Project as a part of a larger National Project for the Control and
Containment of FMD. The project will cover the entire state but will create a disease
containment zone covering the 9 coastal districts in category \u2018A\u2019 with the exception of
Baragarh District, as it is not a coastal district, and as it also happens to be a border district
along the boundary of Madhya Pradesh.
Containment of FMD along the coast will be comparatively easy as the sea prevents
the ingress of the disease all along the coast and border vaccinations along the open
boundaries will effectively keep the most productive coastal districts under category \u2018A\u2019
disease free. The strategy for control will be the tested methodology of the erstwhile FMD
Control project in Southern Peninsula, suitably modified to confirm to the geographical
formation of Orissa.

5.3 Control of other diseases
Vaccinations and control programme for other disease like HS and BQ will continue
on \u201cneed basis\u201d, preventive vaccinations in the endemic areas annually based on the state
endemic chart and ring vaccinations and stamping out procedures during outbreaks.
Vaccines against diseases of sheep, goat and poultry will be stocked in distributed storage
points in the districts and delivered to Breeders\u2019 Associations and Self Help Groups for
timely vaccinations by the village technicians.
The disease control programme comprises the FMD control programme, control,
measures for other bovine diseases, control programmes for sheep and goat diseases and
control of poultry diseases. It will require enormous efforts to produce and procure quality
vaccines. Hence the Orissa Biological Products Institute of Bhubaneswar and the satellite
units will be strengthened, re-equipped and modernized with necessary infrastructure and
skill to produce high quality vaccines.
5.4 Diagnostic Laboratories
The existing diagnostic laboratories will be suitably strengthened to take up
challenges of emerging diseases with bio-technological methods. Each district will have a
district diagnostic laboratory and related laboratories of the Orissa Veterinary College and
the Animal Disease Research Institute will act as referral laboratories. Institute of Life
Science will also be involved in the exercise.
Bio-security measures will be adopted against hazards likely to emanate at all levels
of production of biological and livestock. An excellent but simple disease reporting and
monitoring system with NIC network link at district and state level including OUAT, a credible
cold chain, systematic vaccination and well orchestrated coordination with border states and
center will be the key components.
5.5. Fodder Development Plan
Fodder production by the farmers is possible only if they can spare land for that
purpose if they have access to extra irrigation and if the animals they want to feed can viably
support cultivation of fodder. In a predominantly subsistence farming system, supporting
very low producing non-descript animals, the question of large scale promotion activities for
fodder development does not arise.
The new livestock policy initiatives will therefore focus on selected areas for
promotional activities. However such activities will not include production of fodder seeds by
the Department, but will comprise exclusively promotional activities like supply of fodder mini
kits, supply of tropical grass cutting (tussocks) and promotion of fodder seed production by
farmers. During phase I, these activities will be introduced only in category \u201cA\u201d districts.
In \u201cA\u201d category districts, by creating access to Institutional Finance, the farmers need
to be encouraged to take up fodder production and seed production commercially by
exploring market support. Government should provide all technical support for the purpose.
Due emphasis will be given on natural fodder resources management.

6. Credit and Subsidy for Livestock Sector Development
Livestock sector development will necessitate a judicious mix of credit and subsidy,
as small holders, many among them living below the poverty line, dominate the sector. The
attempt under the new livestock sector policy will be to enable them to achieve viable levels
of efficiency and move up to viable mix of livelihood options. The policy will also enable the
small holders to maximize resource utilization through better quality credit and better access
to credit. The programmes through which the development plan enables the small holders to
improve quality of life are: (i) special livestock breeding programme like subsidy package for
raising the first cross bred calf in small holder households below the poverty line, (ii) access
to concessional credit for acquiring livestock and poultry on SGSY terms, (iii) commercial
credit for acquisition of livestock and poultry, (iv) credit for acquisition of draught animals,
and (v) credit for fodder development / production.
7. Human and Institutional Development: Extension and Training
Animal Husbandry extension is virtually non-existent in the State and, if at all, is
limited to giving advice to farmers in a fashion not conducive to secular livestock growth.
However, for an operation, in the scale presently envisaged, according to the new plan
policy an effective interface between the participating community and various actors likely to
be involved in delivery of services has become imperative. In view of the new livestock
sector policy and its requirement, the Animal Husbandry Extension will be reoriented and
redesigned to help the small producers/farmers and solve their problems.
The central concern of the livestock development and management policy is the
overall well-being of the livestock keepers and in particular of the weaker sections and of
women. Further, people are primarily responsible for the development and management of
livestock. The Director, AH & VS can only facilitate and support. Therefore, improved
productivity of livestock and improved quality of the livestock keepers are possible only if
policies focus directly on people and policy instruments are directed towards building their
capacities for vibrant, competitive, informed and responsible participation in very aspect of
the livestock sector.
The approach towards livestock development will change from delivery of pre-
packaged services to participatory process of planning, implementation and monitoring of
development, based on people\u2019s knowledge, access and control over resources, their
development aspirations and their perceptions regarding what risks they are willing and able
to take as livestock entrepreneurs.
Since women are key stakeholders in livestock management, they will become much
more visible in livestock development. They will have much greater access to and control
over resources, technology, credit and decision making. Further, the benefits that flow out of
livestock development will serve much better the needs and aspirations of women. Women
will be supported to enter the public domain of livestock development and management such
as co-operatives, breeders associations through training and exposure programmes.
The various organizations and institutions responsible for promotion and facilitation of
livestock development will have more equal representation of women at all levels. The
culture and environment within these organizations and institutions will be made responsive
and sensitive to the needs of women. They will pro-actively build systems and procedures
that are gender friendly and enable women to perform.

      ', 
        17.
      ',

Since the policy is also concerned with questions of equity, the organizations and
institutions involved in livestock development will develop greater sensitivity to the
development aspirations of the marginalized communities such as SCs and STs. They will
develop special programmes to capacitate them for equal participation in the overall
livestock development process.
To translate these concerns into realities the following areas will receive focused
attention:
a. Extension
Improved productivity and returns to people will be crucially dependant on the quality
of extension services. The focus of extension will be on improved capacity of people. This
capacitating calls for access to information, innovative and appropriate technologies, skill
and knowledge building to access and control technologies, exposure to success stories,
building leadership, on farm experimentation, building effective people\u2019s organizations,
supporting these organizations with access to technical and financial institutions, markets,
etc. Such capacitating requires integrated, need-based and timely delivery of services as
close to the people as possible. Quality extension will be ensured by strengthening and
streamlining the extension structure of the Director, AH & VS and by equipping personnel of
the Department with proper attitude, knowledge and skills regarding extension, gender and
equity. Such training interventions must be dovetailed with human resources and institutional
development policies that value human resources as the most crucial. Extension will be
restructured to promote convergent approach involving various technical training , the
financial service organization, delivery of quality services at the doorstep moving from free
services to payment for quality and timely services. Subsidies will be used as policy
instruments to promote livestock development and management along more productive and
equitable directions.
Rather than imposing technical innovations from above and outside, an incremental
approach will be adopted based on people\u2019s knowledge, capacities and resources.
Extension services will not only include livestock productive related activities; it will spread
into areas related to the quality of life of the producers.
b. Training
Training will specifically address attitude, knowledge and skill development of
personnel of support organizations, leader of community based organizations and livestock
keepers. In addition, training will aim at orienting community leaders and influential persons
such as teachers so that they can promote livestock development along these policy
directions. Training curricula and programmes will be developed basing on appraisal of
performance and training needs assessment at all levels. Training programmes will include
induction training, refresher courses, training of trainers, exposure programmes, thematic
workshops and seminars, exchange programmes and specialized training programmes.
Specialised training will be given to persons who have to perform critical function in areas
such as policy making, MIS system development and management, convergent approach,
promoting and managing community based organizations, gender, etc. Training programmes
will also include areas such as personality development, interpersonal relationships, problem
solving, organizational management, participatory planning and review. Adequate resources
for human capacity development will be mobilized both from Departmental budgets and from
external sources such as Central Government, bilateral and multilateral aid etc. Wherever
feasible, collaboration will be sought with other Departments and institutions so that
maximum use will be made of scarce resources.

The planning, co-ordination, implementation, monitoring and impact assessment of
training will be entrusted to the HID -cell of the Director, AH & VS. Its personnel and
personnel of training institutes such as Veterinary Officers Training Institute (VOTI),
Livestock Inspectors Training Centres (LITCs) and Frozen Semen Bank (FSB) will be
specially equipped and supported with adequate resources to carry out training functions
efficiently and effectively. Basic professional training of veterinarians will remain as the
responsibility of the Veterinary College of OUAT.
c. Human Resources (HR) and Institutional Development (ID) Policies.
Training alone and in isolation may not guarantee enhanced performance and
improved participation. Therefore, HR policies and programmes will be developed and linked
to ID in areas such as recruitment policy, basic and refresher training, gender policies in
recruitment and placement, more effective use of women resources, transparent
performance appraisal systems and systems for rewards and recognition. The HID cell of the
DAH & VS will facilitate the translation of these policy concerns into plans and programmes.
8. Processing and Marketing
The marketing of livestock products like milk, meat and eggs including live animals,
chicks and birds, by and large, is in the hands of private traders who are basically
unorganized. The Orissa State Co-operative Milk Producers\u2019 Federation and its affiliated
bodies have about four per cent marketing share of milk and milk products. The Orissa State
Poultry Products Co-operative Marketing Federation has only a marginal presence in the
market place. With the current level of production and demand, there is little scope for export
of livestock products to other states except certain items under the poultry segment.
However, with three to four fold increase in production, envisioned by 2012, the
farmers / small producers will be wholly at the mercy of the private traders. As it always
happens with fluctuating market dynamics and unscrupulous trade practices in unorganized
markets, the small producers are at a disadvantage. While the Government has no intension
to control market dynamics, yet to safeguard the production and marketing interest of small
producers, it will promote increased numbers of producers co-operatives besides
strengthening the existing societies throughout the state.
In response to increased milk production, initiated and monitored through the DCS, it
will be necessary to reorganize, renovate and increase processing and chilling capacity in
the state. This can be accomplished by expanding the existing major dairy processing plants
at Bhubaneswar and Rourkela. Additionally, a new dairy plant of 1,00,000 LPD capacity will
be constructed at Cuttack. The processing plants catering to the proximate market at
Calcutta, Cuttack, Sambalpur, Keonjhar, Balasore, Ganajm, Dhenkanal and Koraput will be
renovated and their capacity be increased.
There will be a new a reorientation of the milk collection and in the new approach,
chilling centers will be the basis for the organized rural milk collection. Under this approach,
bulk coolers of appropriate size will be installed to cover 3 to 5 DCSs each, from where
chilled milk will be transported to the dairies through bulk transport.
Modern slaughter houses for meat animals with adequate hygienic facilitation and
sanitation will be established in the major cities. This will be accomplished in a joint
approach between Government and private sector, whereby the management will be
entrusted to the later. Simple slaughter facilities will be created in other district headquarters
and NAC areas.

One large and three medium capacity poultry processing plants all in the private or
cooperative sector are envisaged to be installed with a joint capacity of processing over 10
million surplus bird per year. A medium capacity pork processing plant will also be
established.
9. Monitoring and Review
Monitoring, control and feedback systems are critically important to ensure that
livestock development and management are in fact moving in the directions set by the
policy. An effective management information system will be developed and put in place
securing professional support for its designing and implementation. This MIS will include
both physical and financial plans and achievements as well as the more qualitative aspects
such as participation, gender, equity, success stories, etc. Apart from monitoring
performance, the MIS will serve as an analytical tool for identifying constraints and
bottlenecks, organizational and institutional blocks and in deciding on strategies to overcome
these. Monitoring and review systems will be made participatory. Personnel of the HID-cell
will be equipped to maintain and update the MIS system and senior officers will be trained to
use MIS as a management tool.

DEVELOPMENT OF THE ORISSA STATE LIVESTOCK
SECTOR POLICY
The Government of Orissa appointed a high powered steering committee in 1998,
chaired by the Commissioner\u2013cum\u2013Principal Secretary, FARD, to undertake a
comprehensive review and analysis of the status of the Livestock Sector in Orissa. The
study was organized and financed by the Indo-Swiss NRM Programme Orissa. It was a
comprehensive exercise, executed by a group of 20 local consultants, comprising of high
level professional in livestock development, led by Dr. M. P. G. Kurup, a senior consultant
and Ex-Director NDDB, Anand. The study was done with close consultation of the various
stakeholders related to livestock production. Apart from a comprehensive status report, the
study resulted in the compilation of a draft Livestock Sector Policy, which was submitted in
November\u2019 1999 for consideration of the State Government.
During the next two years, the Fisheries & Animal Resources Development
Department, Government of Orissa, subjected the draft policy to a series of scrutiny and
consultation with scientists, professionals, farmers and agro-entrepreneurs, group wise or as
individuals. The policy was also examined by various related Government Departments.
As backstopping support, the Indo-Swiss NRM Programme Orissa conducted a study
on the possible implications of implementation of the Livestock Sector Policy, the outcome of
which was presented to the high-level officers of FARD and the Agricultural Production
Commissioner, it was also discussed in a workshop attended by Veterinary professionals of
the AHD, OMFED, various NGOs, Milk co-operatives and services associations of Veterinary
& Para-Veterinary professionals.
After the various rounds of revisions and adaptations, the Orissa State Livestock
Sector Policy, in the form as presented here, was sanctioned by the Chief Minister and the
Cabinet of Orissa on the 26th
of October 2002. It was indicated that the policy should be
dynamic and subject to a permanent process of objective scrutiny, testing it to the actual
developments in the sector, so as to revise it from time to time and update it to address the
prevailing situation.

ORISSA STATE LIVESTOCK SECTOR POLICY
October 2002
1. Current Policy Environment
The Orissa Government Policy on Agriculture Development, including Livestock
seeks to ensure the welfare of the vast majority of its people living in the rural areas and
stresses social justice and equality of opportunity as important considerations in the
development strategy. Within the confines of this basic objective, the state\u2019s policy intends in
general to build a progressively modern and dynamic agricultural livestock economy in the
state leading to improved employment potential, increased income, self-sufficiency in food
and food security for the state. During the past five decades of the planned development era
post independence, the state however, has operated pretty much without a comprehensive
policy framework in the Agriculture and Livestock sectors. The state formulated its first
comprehensive Agricultural policy framework, including a component of Animal Husbandry,
only in 1996.
Livestock sector in Orissa is highly livelihood intensive and over 80 per cent of its
rural households own livestock of one species or the other and earn supplementary incomes
from them. Livestock holding is less iniquitous than land holding and income from livestock is
more equitably distributed. The sector contributes 7.25 per cent of the state\u2019s net domestic
product and , therefore , development of the livestock sector is the critical pathway to rural
prosperity. However, livestock sector policy so far, had only a marginal presence in the
sectoral economy and the policies , in general, have failed to galvanise purposeful action.
The Government of Orissa, therefore, appointed a high-powered Steering Committee
in 1998 to make a comprehensive review of the state livestock sector and to recommend
new policy directions in order to enable the State Government to formulate a new Livestock
Sector Policy Framework. The Steering Committee felt that, in the wake of the changing
economic policies nationally and globally, the state livestock sector policy has to take a more
holistic view of the sector and find ways of catalyzing rapid economic growth and
development in the decades to come. The Steering Committee recommended that the State
should formulate a comprehensive new policy framework for its Livestock Sector in order to
help the sector to play its appointed role in the development of the state in the decades to
come. These proposals for a new policy framework are based on the recommendations of
the Steering Committee.
2. Goals of New Livestock Sector Policy
On the basis of the livestock sector review 1999, it is apparent that the over-arching
goals that Orissa\u2019s new livestock sector policy should pursue, shall be:
2.1. Use the livestock sector as an engine for the social and economic development
of the rural population enabling steady growth of rural household income,
increasing rural employment opportunities and improved quality of life, cutting
across caste, class and gender.
2.2. Enable the small producers to actively participate in the process of
development and equip them with information, skills and technologies to
transform the growing challenges of the market place, into comparative and
competitive advantages through improved livestock quality and higher
productivity.

      ', 
        4.
      ', 
    4
2.3. Ensure the ecological and environmental sustainability of the livestock sector
growth and modernization; constantly monitoring the environmental impact of
the growth process and designing policies and programmes to effectively
mitigate their adverse impact.
2.4. To capacitate the marginalized sections, especially women, SCs and STs with
supplementary inputs and services, so that they are enabled to have equal
access to the opportunities offered under this new livestock development and
management policy.
For achieving the proposed policy goals, the Department of Fisheries and Animal
Resources Development (FARD), the administrative and nodal Department in the State
Government for Livestock Development, will interact and liaise with other State Departments
like Agriculture, Cooperation, Finance, Planning & Coordination, Revenue, Forest &
Environment, Rural Development and Panchayat Raj, Labour & Employment and with the
Government of India.
The Department of FARD will co-ordinate interaction between Government and
Industry, between Cooperatives, NGOs and Private Enterprises, between Research
Establishment and Industry and among a host of other actors whose actions will shape
Orissa\u2019s competitive advantage. The most decisive role for the Government is to design a
policy framework for the livestock sector for the coming decades and of orchestrating the
actions of the multitude of actors involved in the sector.
3. Proposed Policy Framework and Strategies
Orissa\u2019s New Livestock Sector Policy Framework is proposed along the following
Seven Key Thrust Areas:
3.1 Capacitate and equip the rural poor to use livestock production as the
instrument to enhance household income, supplement family nutrition and to
protect rural livelihood systems, giving special emphasis to women.
Livestock production in Orissa is predominantly the endeavour of the small holders.
Marginal and small farmers account for some 80 per cent of the total operational holdings.
Together with the landless they own 60 per cent of the milch animals, 55 per cent of the
draught animals, 75 per cent of the poultry, over 80 per cent of the goat and almost the
entire sheep and pig populations and over half of them live below the poverty line. Women
play a crucial role in the day to day management of livestock.
Income from livestock is therefore a substantial supplement to the overwhelmingly
subsistence farming systems in rural Orissa. Enabling them to maximize livestock income
can make all the difference between subsistence and progressively viable farming systems.
A critical role the Government proposes to play, therefore, is to help them maximize returns
on hitherto free resources of crop residues, grazing and family labour. For this several
specific policies are proposed.
3.1(a) Redesign and reconfigure the input delivery service under the Government to
serve as a protective armour around the small producers and their subsistence
farming systems.
Animal health care and breeding services are the two most important services that
the state now provides free to the livestock producers. Improving the quality of these
 
  ', 
  ', 
      ', 
        5.
      ', 
    5
services and their usefulness to the producers is the prime consideration under the new
policy. There is increasing evidence that farmers prefer good quality paid services to poor
quality free service.
In order to make these services improve their quality, reach out to the farmers whom
it seeks to serve and becomes accountable, the Government will progressively make
veterinary and artificial insemination services, mobile practices operating within their existing
jurisdictions and delivering the services at the farmers door-step, as paid inputs. Under the
new policy the Government will permit the Government employed Veterinarians, Livestock
Inspectors and Inseminators to practice their profession / trade and to charge for the
services delivered at the farmers\u2019 door-step at market rates. These reforms will be
implemented in a phased manner; first in well developed areas, which can absorb the
change and work it to their advantage. Extension of the policy and introduction of the new
delivery systems in other areas will follow an economic change scale.
3.1(b) Equip and empower the small producers with information and skills to
maximize returns, through appropriate technologies and self help approach to
problem solving.
There are many services and inputs needed by livestock owners in the day to day
management of their livestock enterprise and most of these do not need the services of a
qualified Veterinarian or Livestock Inspector. The magnitude of the task is so large that the
only solution is to create such skills among the users \u2013 the small holders themselves- in their
villages. The tasks are veterinary first aid, vaccination of birds and animals, ecto and endo
parasite control, innovative feed supplementing techniques, shelter innovations and candling
of desi eggs for hatching. These are all simple skills needed in villages constantly. Young
men and women from the small holder households can be trained to practise these skills,
provide service to the small holders and even earn a small income for their services,
addressing men and women equally.
3.1(c ) Promote and nurture grass root level participatory bodies all over the state, as
the organic link between the Animal Husbandry Department and the small
holders.
Just as in the case of inputs and services to the scattered small holders, training
them for various skills required for the day-to-day management of their livestock enterprise,
is also a task outside the size and scope of the State Department of Fisheries and Animal
Resources Development The Department\u2019s task is to assess and quantify the training
needs, to structure and package the training programmes and to farm them out to grass root
level bodies all over the state for implementation.
Several forms of such grass root level bodies are possible: Producers Co-operatives,
Breeders\u2019 Associations, Self Help Groups and Voluntary Organizations. These organizations
can form the organic link between the Department and the small holders as well as the
conduit for transfer of technologies, skill training, extension support and even inputs.
The Government and the Department will kick start the movement of promoting
grass roots bodies in a few chosen districts and nurture them as live models for other
districts and areas to follow on their own. The Government would encourage and support
local initiative in building up such organizations / groups, in any area in the state. A budget
for structuring and promoting the organic link would be a part of the policy implications.

3.2 Promote adoption of appropriate technologies, enhance productivity, increase
effectiveness and ensure returns proportionate to the investment of time,
energy and resources that small holders, particularly women, make for
livestock development and management.
Government policy would focus on aggressive strategies to integrate the small
producer in the larger process of sectoral growth. A critical area for experimentation and
promotion towards this is the intermediate production system, which enables the small
holder to gradually integrate the highly productive modern technology and management into
his traditional system. Introducing half bred milch animals into the traditional small holder
households is an excellent example for the intermediate production system, which not only
gives some high production features, but also preserves some of the ruggedness of the local
animals he is used to. There are many others like this involving other species of livestock
and poultry.
These intermediate production systems depend on high technologies like Artificial
Insemination (AI), the most critical tool that the science has given to animal production.
Orissa is yet to exploit the tool to the full advantage of its many milk producers, in spite of
establishing very large infrastructure and skill pool. Restructuring the management of the AI
system is the critical reform for establishing intermediate production systems. The new
livestock sector policy seeks to transfer the task of generating high quality AI inputs like
genetically evaluated AI bulls, frozen semen and liquid nitrogen and their supply to all AI
practitioners, to a new organization, incorporated as a registered society, \u201cThe Orissa
Livestock Resources Development Society\u201d. AI delivery itself will be reorganized as mobile
service delivering a vastly improved AI service at the farmers\u2019 door-step.
Graded pigs with exotic donors for higher body weights, moving in genetically
selected bucks and rams for goat and sheep breeding into small holder units for selective
breeding and custom bred desi breeding cocks for the backyard poultry are other examples
for engineering intermediate production systems in small holdings.
To promote intermediate production system, Government will mobilize credit through
commercial banks for mini dairy schemes, small animals and poultry schemes. There will
also be a subsidy package similar to the Government of India scheme \u201cSpecial Livestock
Breeding Programme\u201d (SLBP), along with concessional credit scheme for the bottom end of
the small holder spectrum.
3.3 Encourage growth and modernization of the livestock sector in a well balanced
format where all species of livestock are allowed to grow and develop in
proportion to their livelihood intensity and potential to enhance livelihoods;
not merely in proportion to their population size.
Development of the livestock sector in Orissa so far, had largely been monopolized
by the bovine. Sheep, goat, pig and poultry are far more livelihood intensive and are owned
by the bottom end of the small holder households. The new livestock sector policy will
incorporate adequate safe guards to balance the species wise outlay of the State and
Central plan, largely in proportion to the livelihood implication of these species of livestock.
These interventions actually will comprise measures for (i) skill training, subsidies for
acquiring breeding stock like genetically selected cocks for the backyard system, bucks,
rams and boars for goat, sheep and pig breeding respectively; and concessional credit for
household level enterprises, on one plane; (ii) breeding and selection programmes for all
species, on the second and (iii) aggressive promotional activities for building up an organic
link of peoples\u2019 bodies outside the Government, so essential for the sub sector, on the third
plane.

3.4 Resolute direct action by the Government in such areas as disease control and
eradication and quality control mechanisms.
Curative veterinary care generates only private good while prevention and control of
animal diseases generates enormous public good to the advantage of the state and the
nation as a whole. Control of diseases will reduce the yield gap and cut down the annuals
losses due to diseases - Rs.2.5 billion - in the case of Orissa. Under the new livestock policy,
public funds will increasingly be directed towards public good disease prevention and control
and less for curative veterinary care.
The new livestock policy will enable the launch of a state wide FMD control
programme as part of a national control programme, an active and responsive disease
reporting system and disease containment zone in the most productive areas in the state.
3.5 Devise ways to ensure that the sector grows with the active and gainful
participation of the resource poor throughout the state.
For quite some time to come, the State Government needs to devise and implement
specific policies and programmes to enable the small holders to progressively approach
viable levels of efficiency and output, through better access to credit, better quality credit and
some subsidy support.
The Government is not in favour of subsidy as an instrument of development but
under the prevailing poverty scenario it will develop a creative policy to generate positive
response which will not be antithetical to the interest of the resource poor, progress and
efficiency and by which the small holders will progressively reach viable levels of efficiency
and output with access to better quality credit and subsidy support.
The State will have two kinds of credit inflow for the livestock sector :
a) Commercial Credit for the upper end of the smallholder producers engaged in livestock
enterprises to enable them to move into intermediate production system.
b) A concessional and liberalised credit scheme for the bottom half of the small holder
spectrum, in the IRDP format, to enable them to move above the poverty line and to
achieve the efficiency levels for entering into intermediate systems.
3.6 Ensure the ecological and environmental sustainability of livestock sector
growth and modernization; mitigating their adverse impact through
appropriate policies and programmes.
The very large and growing population of bovine is a major threat to sustainability of
all animals and agriculture in Orissa. Reduction in cattle numbers is possible only if the
dependence on draught animals for farm power declines. The new livestock policy will
encourage a set of measures to reduce the dependence on draught animals for farm power
and to reduce their numbers: (i) Optimal sharing of work animals by farmers; (ii) Improved
quality of work animals through grading up of local animals with Haryana breed; (iii)
Vigorously encouraging lease markets for work animals, promoting team labour and (iv)
Encouraging establishment of agro-service centres in major villages, enabling custom hiring
of farm machinery and tractors.
Another major ecological concern is the deterioration of common property resources.
The problem of designing the interface between livestock owners and common property
resources is complex and intractable. For the new livestock policy it makes best sense to
 
  ', 
  ', 
      ', 
        8.
      ', 
    8
encourage and support a variety of experiments and approaches to: (i) generate alternatives
that reduce pressure on rural people to pursue livelihood strategies detrimental to their
habitat and (ii) promote symbiotic and synergetic relationships between local communities
and their environment, through participatory natural resource management.
3.7 Restructure and revitalize existing institutional set up in the livestock sector,
enhance institution level efficiency and promote new institutional models to
handle the emerging challenges in sector development.
Under the regime of the new policy, two major initiatives are proposed: (i) existing
institutional structure will be reoriented and geared up to play a far bigger and demanding
role, partly through restructuring and partly by redefining its mission; and (ii) there are many
tasks that need to be performed, for which the best strategy would be to promote institutions
outside the Government.
The mandate of the Department of Fisheries and Animal Resources Development
under the new policy would be: (i) Control, containment and eradication of animal diseases;
and (ii) Livestock sector development. Department will progressively move away from
delivery of veterinary care and AI services, first converting them into mobile practices;
gradually retreating towards the privatization of the services. The Department will have a
bipolar structure, reflecting the mandate - one group engaged in disease control and the
other in livestock development. Disease control will be the direct action by the Department;
but for livestock development the Department will work in a participatory format. The
Department\u2019s training capacity will be geared up to cater to the needs of intensified
participatory extension service and empowerment of Non-Governmental Organisations
active in livestock development.
The development tasks under the new policy will necessitate the promotion of a new
autonomous body \u201cthe Orissa Livestock Resource Development Society\u201d (OLRDS), a
registered society under the Societies Act, which will take over all the AI infrastructure,
except the field AI centers. It will generate all the genetic inputs for breeding of cattle and
buffalo and will establish a state-wide infrastructure for the distributed bulk movement and
bulk storage of liquid nitrogen. Frozen semen and liquid nitrogen will be delivered to all AI
practitioners at their doorstep by the OLRDS, against payment.
The Orissa State Cooperative Milk Producers Federation (OMFED) and the milk
unions affiliated to it will be re-promoted with greater autonomy, greater member control and
reduced Government interventions in order to enable it to pursue its charter and business
interest as a commercial enterprise of producer members.
The Utkal Gomangal Samiti (UGS) will take up larger responsibilities in promoting
natural breeding service and use of cross bred bullocks.
The Orissa State Poultry Products Co-operative Marketing Federation (OPOLFED)
will be re -promoted as a development co -operative to take up the responsibility of supplying
the genetic inputs and appropriate technologies for the backyard poultry system in addition
to assisting small producers to market their products.
The Orissa University of Agriculture and Technology (OUAT) through its constituent
colleges will provide necessary technical input and guidance in matters relating to overall
livestock sectoral growth.
Agricultural Promotion and Investment Corporation of Orissa Ltd. (APICOL) will
promote dairy and poultry industries on commercial scale through entrepreneurship
development programme. A food processing unit will be within the ambit of its objective.

District Rural Development Agency (DRDA) / Zilla Parishad will disseminate
developmental work under Animal Husbandry sector at grass root level under Panchayat Raj
System.
Breeders Associations, Voluntary Agencies and Non-Governmental Organisations
will be promoted to activate the grass root level bodies and for imparting training and transfer
of skills as may be defined by the State Government.
4. Perspective Plan for Livestock Development in Orissa.
The proposed policy framework will be translated into specific actions through a ten
year perspective plan for the development of livestock in the State. The plan covers all
species of livestock including poultry and spans a ten year period from 2002 to 2012
for implementation in two phases, each of five years: Phase I \u2013 2002-2007 and Phase II
\u2013 2007-2012.
The Government of India is in the process of giving final approvals for the \u201cNational
Project for Cattle and Buffalo Breeding\u201d which more or less overlaps the state development
plan discussed here and it has many commonalities with the cattle and buffalo breeding part
of this plan. The strategies and action plan for cattle and buffalo breeding in both are
therefore identical and the state plan is designed to merge with the national project and to
receive full funding for it from the national project.
The action plan under the state livestock development plan (SLDP) is designed area
and species specific, staggering the implementation process in consonance with the
development status of the area and ability of the farming community there to absorb the
changes to their advantage. All the 30 districts in the state are grouped into three categories:
Category A \u2013 most potential; B - Potential and C \u2013 least potential, based on several criteria
specifically relevant to dairy production. The typification of areas of development of other
species is on the basis of specific animal population size, households owning the different
species of livestock and production aggregates of livestock produce.
The plan will be implemented in the state by a consortium of implementing agencies,
the State Department of Fisheries and Animal Resources Development; the proposed
\u201cOrissa Livestock Resource Development Society\u201d, the Orissa State Milk Producers\u2019
Cooperative Federation, the Utkal Gomangal Samiti, the Orissa State Poultry Products Co-
operative Marketing Federation and other agencies like Non Governmental Organisations
(NGOs), Voluntary Organisations (VOs), Bilateral / Multilateral Assistance Projects, etc.,
that the Government of Orissa designates as \u201cImplementing Agencies\u201d.
Project funding will come from two major sources: State Plan and Non-plan Budgets,
Central Plan Assistance and Institutional Finance. The major investment for cattle and
buffalo breeding component will be sourced from the Central Project for Cattle and Buffalo
Breeding.
4.1 Action Plan for Cattle and Buffalo Breeding in Orissa.
The plan will progressively bring under organized breeding operations increasing
numbers of adult female populations of cattle and buffalo during the 10th
year plan period
2002-2007, 50 per cent of the indigenous cattle, 70 per cent of the cross bred cattle and 40
per cent of the buffaloes.
The development tasks under the cattle and buffalo development plan are :

(b) Convert in a phased manner all the Government AI centers to mobile AI practices and
allow the Government employed inseminators to practise doorstep delivery of AI as a
paid service.
(c) Conversion of the DCS (Dairy Co-operative Society) based AI centers in the milk
cooperative sector into cluster AI practices covering about six society villages under
each cluster practice; and start new, mobile cluster AI practices to bring all the DCSs
under AI coverage.
(d) New stationary AI centers will be opened under the Department in B and C category
districts to intensify breeding coverage.
(e) Set up mobile AI practice by trained private AI practitioners in large numbers, to expand
the coverage of breeding female cattle and buffalo; and to deliver AI at the farmers door
step as a paid service.

(f) In areas inaccessible and unsuitable for AI, selected bulls will be strategically stationed
for natural service.
(g) Expand and strengthen the existing two frozen semen production stations at Cuttack and
Bhawanipatna and establish a new Frozen Semen Production Station at Chipilima to
enhance production of frozen semen.
(h) Strengthen all existing semen banks and establish new semen banks to enhance
distributed storage of frozen semen and liquid nitrogen, and delivery of both to all AI
practitioners.
(i) Establish infrastructure for the bulk movement and distributed bulk storage of liquid
nitrogen in the state and manage the liquid nitrogen delivery system.
(j) Strengthen the training facilities in the state and initiate refresher training of all the in-
service Inseminators and start basic training of new mobile AI practitioners.
(k) Set in motion a quality assurance programme covering all aspects of the AI service in
the state: Bulls, Semen, Semen Production Stations and AI Service across the board.
(l) Establish systematic field performance recording programmes and progeny testing of AI
bulls as a regular and continuing requirement for bull selection.
Breeding policy for the cattle under the project will be:
a) In order to improve the body size and body weight of the local cattle both for producing
good work animals as well as a good foundation stock for cross breeding, Haryana
breed will be used only for upgrading Binjharpuri Cattle and nondescript animals of
relatively larger size available for any other areas. In the districts like Kalahandi,
Nuapada & Koraput, short statured cattle are generally used for draught purposes.
These cattle are used to pull bullock carts with wheels of smaller size. It will, therefore,
be desirable to use Red Sindhi to upgrade these cattle for producing dual purpose
progenies.
b) For milch animal production, it will be necessary to upgrade the local cattle with exotic
bulls. Jersey and Holstein will be used as improver breeds. However, looking to climatic
condition of the state and taking economic condition of the farmers into consideration,
Jersey has been anticipated as the breed of choice for large scale cross breeding of the
local cattle. Holstein, however, can be used as improver breed only in limited areas
where ambient temperature does not go very high, i.e. beyond 40º C and the farmers are
resourceful to provide feed and other inputs to the Holstein cross breeds.
c) The inter se mating population should be of exotic & local bulls. This will avoid
procurement of large number of exotic and Haryana bulls and also local half breds will
be more adoptive.
d) Murrah buffalo bulls can be used for upgrading the local buffaloes for producing dual
purpose animals (milch and draught). In order to maintain and conserve local breeds for
buffaloes, certain areas in the breeding tracts of Parlakhemundi, Sambalpur and Chilika
may be earmarked for selective breeding by using selected buffaloes bulls of respective
breeds.
e) In order to preserve the native breeds (germplasm) like Binjharpuri, Ghumsari, Motu etc.
in their home tracts from its extinction / dilution, efforts should be made to preserve
them.

f) Research on breeding of cows and buffaloes and performance of the progenies may be
taken up.
g) The maximum level of exotic blood be preferably maintained at 62.5%.
Project Implementation
Four implementing agencies will be involved with project implementation in addition
to any voluntary agencies and bilateral projects designated by the Government of Orissa: (i)
the Orissa Livestock Resource Development Society (OLRDS), (ii) the Department of
Fisheries and ARD, (iii) the Orissa State Co-operative Milk Producers Federation (OMFED),
and (iv) the Utkal Gomangal Samiti.
The OLRDS will be the principal implementing agency for the cattle and buffalo
breeding plan. It will generate all the genetic inputs for breeding like evaluated bulls, frozen
semen, liquid nitrogen and will deliver the semen and liquid nitrogen to all AI practitioners in
the state, on a regular, systematic and continued basis. All infrastructures for AI except the
field AI centers will be transferred to the society. The Society will establish additional
facilities needed.
The Department of Fisheries and ARD will continue to own and operate all the AI
centres, but will progressively convert them into mobile practices delivering AI at the farmers
door-step. The Department will train Inseminators and all Inseminators under all agencies
practising AI in the state will be tested and licensed by the Department.
The OMFED will convert all the existing DCS AI centers into mobile cluster AI
practices to bring all DCSs under AI coverage. The OMFED and the milk unions will carry
out the field recording programme for progeny testing on behalf of the OLRDS and will be
reimbursed all costs for the programme by OLRDS.
The Utkal Gomangal Samiti will be responsible for launching a large Natural Service
(NS) Bull programme for providing breeding facilities in villages where AI is not feasible.
They will select and raise the Haryana, cross bred and Murrah bulls required for the NS
Scheme. The UGS will also launch a promotion and rearing programme for popularizing
cross bred bullocks among the farming community.
4.2 Meat Animal Development Plan
Meat animals in Orissa are sheep, goat and pig. Cattle are used for meat only to a
very small extent and come under the cattle and buffalo development plan. Poultry are dealt
with separately under poultry development plan.
Recommended breeding policy for sheep and goat is selective breeding within the
existing distinctive Orissa breeds of sheep and goat as they have sufficient potential for
improvement in body weight and meat output through selective breeding.
Recommended breeding policy for pig is cross breeding of local pig with Large White
Yorkshire / Charmukha and use of cross bred boars for grading up. In well endowed areas
and in progressive farms, progressive grading upwith the exotic breeds is recommended.
 
  ', 
  ', 
      ', 
        13.
      ', 
    13
Large scale promotion of breeding stock production for sheep and goat through large
and medium farmers and promotion of breeders associations for input supply, training and
extension are the components of meat animal development plan. The OUAT in the
Department of Animal Breeding and Genetics will have a pragmatic and comprehensive
technical programme and selection parameters for launching of a massive breeding stock of
Duck, Doe, Ram and Ewe. Experience of Maharastra in boar breeding will also be taken into
account.
Sheep and Goat development programmes will focus on districts: Sheep: Keonjhar,
Mayurbhanj, Bolangir, Gnajam and Kalahandi; Goat: Sundargarh, Mayurbhanj, Keonjhar,
Balasore, Bolangir and Ganjam. The proposed programmes are: Promotional programmes
for development and supply of breeding rams and bucks through selected breeders, Skill
training of rural technicians and promotion of Breeders\u2019 Association, Self-help groups,
Voluntary and non-Governmental organizations. There will also be a supporting and subsidy
component in the programmes.
For pig development the focus districts will be: Sundargarh, Mayurbhanj, Koraput,
Subarnapur, Malkangiri, Rayagada and Keonjhar. The thrust programme is promotion,
development and supply of cross bred and graded breeding boars and supporting credit and
subsidy.
4.3 Poultry Development Plan
Poultry development plan focuses on the desi fowls in the backyard units which
account for over 80 per cent of all fowls in the state. The organized poultry industry in the
state is capable of meeting all their development needs through the industry itself and needs
only enabling policy support from the Government.
The recommended breeding policy for backyard poultry is selective breeding in
organized farms for large scale generation of breeding stock, particularly cocks for supply to
the backyard units. The goal is for improving the growth rate and body weight without
compromising the current levels of egg production.
The six state poultry farms will be transferred to the OPOLFED and the OPOLFED
will be responsible for starting in collaboration with the Department of Fisheries and ARD
and the OUAT a selection programme based on sire family selection. The OPOLFED will
raise a large number of breeding cocks and hens and will supply them to the backyard units
at market price, as two-week-old chicks. Emphasis will also be laid to experiment Australian
variety basing on the experience of cyclone ravaged areas where a sizeable number of such
cocks were distributed. The recommended breeding policy for backyard poultry through
selective breeding in origanised farms will be taken up.
The other inputs needed by the backyard system are vaccination and extension
support. A poultry breeders\u2019 association will be promoted to look after the extension support
and development of the desi birds. The association will also arrange skill training with the
help of the Department and self help groups in the villages.
Districts chosen for focused action for backyard poultry development programmes
are: Koraput, Mayurbhanj, Ganjam, Keonjhar, Sundargarh and Balasore. The programmes
are: promoting a poultry breeders\u2019 association, promotion of Non Governmental
Organizations and Self Help Groups for training and technology transfer, promotion of
genetic inputs, subsidies and credit for backyard system.

5. Development plan for Animal Health Care Services
Under the new livestock policy, the overall role of the Department and its mandate
will be redefined to focus on prevention and control of animal diseases; and livestock
development. Delivery of services like veterinary care and artificial insemination will be
reconfigured into mobile practices and later would give way to professional practice
delivering the input at the farmers\u2019 door-step as paid services.
5.1 Veterinary Service
This change over in veterinary service delivery however will be gradual over a 25
year period. As a first step the veterinary hospitals, dispensaries and livestock aid centres in
selected districts will be converted into mobile practices delivering the services at the
farmers door step. The veterinary and the para-veterinary officers involved in the mobile
practice will be allowed to treat door-step delivery of services as a private arrangement
between the practitioner and the farmer. The practitioners will continue to be employees of
the Government of Orissa in the Department of Fisheries and ARD and will receive all their
emoluments, allowances and perks till they superannuate.
The programmes for animal health care comprise 1) the conversion of the veterinary
hospitals, dispensaries and livestock aid centres into mobile practice veterinary and AI
services delivery, 2) the capital grants required to equip the veterinarians and the
inseminators, and 3) re-equipping these institutions to handle the changed system. Due
emphasis will be given for animal health insurance coverage.
User charges will be collected for vaccination / AI / diagnostic services and feed
analytical services etc. as prescribed by the State Govt. from time to time. User charges will
be spent in the same districts in which it is collected to improve the quality of service delivery
without any diversion to other districts. State level institutions like Orissa Biological Products
Institution (OBPI) and OLRDS etc. should get share of user charges at agreed percentages.
5.2 FMD Control Programme
The State Government in consultation with the Central Government and the
Governments of the neighbouring states will draw up a State Foot and Mouth Prevention,
Control and Containment Project as a part of a larger National Project for the Control and
Containment of FMD. The project will cover the entire state but will create a disease
containment zone covering the 9 coastal districts in category \u2018A\u2019 with the exception of
Baragarh District, as it is not a coastal district, and as it also happens to be a border district
along the boundary of Madhya Pradesh.
Containment of FMD along the coast will be comparatively easy as the sea prevents
the ingress of the disease all along the coast and border vaccinations along the open
boundaries will effectively keep the most productive coastal districts under category \u2018A\u2019
disease free. The strategy for control will be the tested methodology of the erstwhile FMD
Control project in Southern Peninsula, suitably modified to confirm to the geographical
formation of Orissa.

5.3 Control of other diseases
Vaccinations and control programme for other disease like HS and BQ will continue
on \u201cneed basis\u201d, preventive vaccinations in the endemic areas annually based on the state
endemic chart and ring vaccinations and stamping out procedures during outbreaks.
Vaccines against diseases of sheep, goat and poultry will be stocked in distributed storage
points in the districts and delivered to Breeders\u2019 Associations and Self Help Groups for
timely vaccinations by the village technicians.
The disease control programme comprises the FMD control programme, control,
measures for other bovine diseases, control programmes for sheep and goat diseases and
control of poultry diseases. It will require enormous efforts to produce and procure quality
vaccines. Hence the Orissa Biological Products Institute of Bhubaneswar and the satellite
units will be strengthened, re-equipped and modernized with necessary infrastructure and
skill to produce high quality vaccines.
5.4 Diagnostic Laboratories
The existing diagnostic laboratories will be suitably strengthened to take up
challenges of emerging diseases with bio-technological methods. Each district will have a
district diagnostic laboratory and related laboratories of the Orissa Veterinary College and
the Animal Disease Research Institute will act as referral laboratories. Institute of Life
Science will also be involved in the exercise.
Bio-security measures will be adopted against hazards likely to emanate at all levels
of production of biological and livestock. An excellent but simple disease reporting and
monitoring system with NIC network link at district and state level including OUAT, a credible
cold chain, systematic vaccination and well orchestrated coordination with border states and
center will be the key components.
5.5. Fodder Development Plan
Fodder production by the farmers is possible only if they can spare land for that
purpose if they have access to extra irrigation and if the animals they want to feed can viably
support cultivation of fodder. In a predominantly subsistence farming system, supporting
very low producing non-descript animals, the question of large scale promotion activities for
fodder development does not arise.
The new livestock policy initiatives will therefore focus on selected areas for
promotional activities. However such activities will not include production of fodder seeds by
the Department, but will comprise exclusively promotional activities like supply of fodder mini
kits, supply of tropical grass cutting (tussocks) and promotion of fodder seed production by
farmers. During phase I, these activities will be introduced only in category \u201cA\u201d districts.
In \u201cA\u201d category districts, by creating access to Institutional Finance, the farmers need
to be encouraged to take up fodder production and seed production commercially by
exploring market support. Government should provide all technical support for the purpose.
Due emphasis will be given on natural fodder resources management.

6. Credit and Subsidy for Livestock Sector Development
Livestock sector development will necessitate a judicious mix of credit and subsidy,
as small holders, many among them living below the poverty line, dominate the sector. The
attempt under the new livestock sector policy will be to enable them to achieve viable levels
of efficiency and move up to viable mix of livelihood options. The policy will also enable the
small holders to maximize resource utilization through better quality credit and better access
to credit. The programmes through which the development plan enables the small holders to
improve quality of life are: (i) special livestock breeding programme like subsidy package for
raising the first cross bred calf in small holder households below the poverty line, (ii) access
to concessional credit for acquiring livestock and poultry on SGSY terms, (iii) commercial
credit for acquisition of livestock and poultry, (iv) credit for acquisition of draught animals,
and (v) credit for fodder development / production.
7. Human and Institutional Development: Extension and Training
Animal Husbandry extension is virtually non-existent in the State and, if at all, is
limited to giving advice to farmers in a fashion not conducive to secular livestock growth.
However, for an operation, in the scale presently envisaged, according to the new plan
policy an effective interface between the participating community and various actors likely to
be involved in delivery of services has become imperative. In view of the new livestock
sector policy and its requirement, the Animal Husbandry Extension will be reoriented and
redesigned to help the small producers/farmers and solve their problems.
The central concern of the livestock development and management policy is the
overall well-being of the livestock keepers and in particular of the weaker sections and of
women. Further, people are primarily responsible for the development and management of
livestock. The Director, AH & VS can only facilitate and support. Therefore, improved
productivity of livestock and improved quality of the livestock keepers are possible only if
policies focus directly on people and policy instruments are directed towards building their
capacities for vibrant, competitive, informed and responsible participation in very aspect of
the livestock sector.
The approach towards livestock development will change from delivery of pre-
packaged services to participatory process of planning, implementation and monitoring of
development, based on people\u2019s knowledge, access and control over resources, their
development aspirations and their perceptions regarding what risks they are willing and able
to take as livestock entrepreneurs.
Since women are key stakeholders in livestock management, they will become much
more visible in livestock development. They will have much greater access to and control
over resources, technology, credit and decision making. Further, the benefits that flow out of
livestock development will serve much better the needs and aspirations of women. Women
will be supported to enter the public domain of livestock development and management such
as co-operatives, breeders associations through training and exposure programmes.
The various organizations and institutions responsible for promotion and facilitation of
livestock development will have more equal representation of women at all levels. The
culture and environment within these organizations and institutions will be made responsive
and sensitive to the needs of women. They will pro-actively build systems and procedures
that are gender friendly and enable women to perform.
 
  ', 
  ', 
      ', 
        17.
      ', 
    17
Since the policy is also concerned with questions of equity, the organizations and
institutions involved in livestock development will develop greater sensitivity to the
development aspirations of the marginalized communities such as SCs and STs. They will
develop special programmes to capacitate them for equal participation in the overall
livestock development process.
To translate these concerns into realities the following areas will receive focused
attention:
a. Extension
Improved productivity and returns to people will be crucially dependant on the quality
of extension services. The focus of extension will be on improved capacity of people. This
capacitating calls for access to information, innovative and appropriate technologies, skill
and knowledge building to access and control technologies, exposure to success stories,
building leadership, on farm experimentation, building effective people\u2019s organizations,
supporting these organizations with access to technical and financial institutions, markets,
etc. Such capacitating requires integrated, need-based and timely delivery of services as
close to the people as possible. Quality extension will be ensured by strengthening and
streamlining the extension structure of the Director, AH & VS and by equipping personnel of
the Department with proper attitude, knowledge and skills regarding extension, gender and
equity. Such training interventions must be dovetailed with human resources and institutional
development policies that value human resources as the most crucial. Extension will be
restructured to promote convergent approach involving various technical training , the
financial service organization, delivery of quality services at the doorstep moving from free
services to payment for quality and timely services. Subsidies will be used as policy
instruments to promote livestock development and management along more productive and
equitable directions.
Rather than imposing technical innovations from above and outside, an incremental
approach will be adopted based on people\u2019s knowledge, capacities and resources.
Extension services will not only include livestock productive related activities; it will spread
into areas related to the quality of life of the producers.
b. Training
Training will specifically address attitude, knowledge and skill development of
personnel of support organizations, leader of community based organizations and livestock
keepers. In addition, training will aim at orienting community leaders and influential persons
such as teachers so that they can promote livestock development along these policy
directions. Training curricula and programmes will be developed basing on appraisal of
performance and training needs assessment at all levels. Training programmes will include
induction training, refresher courses, training of trainers, exposure programmes, thematic
workshops and seminars, exchange programmes and specialized training programmes.
Specialised training will be given to persons who have to perform critical function in areas
such as policy making, MIS system development and management, convergent approach,
promoting and managing community based organizations, gender, etc. Training programmes
will also include areas such as personality development, interpersonal relationships, problem
solving, organizational management, participatory planning and review. Adequate resources
for human capacity development will be mobilized both from Departmental budgets and from
external sources such as Central Government, bilateral and multilateral aid etc. Wherever
feasible, collaboration will be sought with other Departments and institutions so that
maximum use will be made of scarce resources.

  ', 
      ', 
        18.
      ', 
    18
The planning, co-ordination, implementation, monitoring and impact assessment of
training will be entrusted to the HID -cell of the Director, AH & VS. Its personnel and
personnel of training institutes such as Veterinary Officers Training Institute (VOTI),
Livestock Inspectors Training Centres (LITCs) and Frozen Semen Bank (FSB) will be
specially equipped and supported with adequate resources to carry out training functions
efficiently and effectively. Basic professional training of veterinarians will remain as the
responsibility of the Veterinary College of OUAT.
c. Human Resources (HR) and Institutional Development (ID) Policies.
Training alone and in isolation may not guarantee enhanced performance and
improved participation. Therefore, HR policies and programmes will be developed and linked
to ID in areas such as recruitment policy, basic and refresher training, gender policies in
recruitment and placement, more effective use of women resources, transparent
performance appraisal systems and systems for rewards and recognition. The HID cell of the
DAH & VS will facilitate the translation of these policy concerns into plans and programmes.
8. Processing and Marketing
The marketing of livestock products like milk, meat and eggs including live animals,
chicks and birds, by and large, is in the hands of private traders who are basically
unorganized. The Orissa State Co-operative Milk Producers\u2019 Federation and its affiliated
bodies have about four per cent marketing share of milk and milk products. The Orissa State
Poultry Products Co-operative Marketing Federation has only a marginal presence in the
market place. With the current level of production and demand, there is little scope for export
of livestock products to other states except certain items under the poultry segment.
However, with three to four fold increase in production, envisioned by 2012, the
farmers / small producers will be wholly at the mercy of the private traders. As it always
happens with fluctuating market dynamics and unscrupulous trade practices in unorganized
markets, the small producers are at a disadvantage. While the Government has no intension
to control market dynamics, yet to safeguard the production and marketing interest of small
producers, it will promote increased numbers of producers co-operatives besides
strengthening the existing societies throughout the state.
In response to increased milk production, initiated and monitored through the DCS, it
will be necessary to reorganize, renovate and increase processing and chilling capacity in
the state. This can be accomplished by expanding the existing major dairy processing plants
at Bhubaneswar and Rourkela. Additionally, a new dairy plant of 1,00,000 LPD capacity will
be constructed at Cuttack. The processing plants catering to the proximate market at
Calcutta, Cuttack, Sambalpur, Keonjhar, Balasore, Ganajm, Dhenkanal and Koraput will be
renovated and their capacity be increased.
There will be a new a reorientation of the milk collection and in the new approach,
chilling centers will be the basis for the organized rural milk collection. Under this approach,
bulk coolers of appropriate size will be installed to cover 3 to 5 DCSs each, from where
chilled milk will be transported to the dairies through bulk transport.
Modern slaughter houses for meat animals with adequate hygienic facilitation and
sanitation will be established in the major cities. This will be accomplished in a joint
approach between Government and private sector, whereby the management will be
entrusted to the later. Simple slaughter facilities will be created in other district headquarters
and NAC areas.

    19
One large and three medium capacity poultry processing plants all in the private or
cooperative sector are envisaged to be installed with a joint capacity of processing over 10
million surplus bird per year. A medium capacity pork processing plant will also be
established.
9. Monitoring and Review
Monitoring, control and feedback systems are critically important to ensure that
livestock development and management are in fact moving in the directions set by the
policy. An effective management information system will be developed and put in place
securing professional support for its designing and implementation. This MIS will include
both physical and financial plans and achievements as well as the more qualitative aspects
such as participation, gender, equity, success stories, etc. Apart from monitoring
performance, the MIS will serve as an analytical tool for identifying constraints and
bottlenecks, organizational and institutional blocks and in deciding on strategies to overcome
these. Monitoring and review systems will be made participatory. Personnel of the HID-cell
will be equipped to maintain and update the MIS system and senior officers will be trained to
use MIS as a management tool.

DEVELOPMENT OF THE ORISSA STATE LIVESTOCK
SECTOR POLICY
The Government of Orissa appointed a high powered steering committee in 1998,
chaired by the Commissioner\u2013cum\u2013Principal Secretary, FARD, to undertake a
comprehensive review and analysis of the status of the Livestock Sector in Orissa. The
study was organized and financed by the Indo-Swiss NRM Programme Orissa. It was a
comprehensive exercise, executed by a group of 20 local consultants, comprising of high
level professional in livestock development, led by Dr. M. P. G. Kurup, a senior consultant
and Ex-Director NDDB, Anand. The study was done with close consultation of the various
stakeholders related to livestock production. Apart from a comprehensive status report, the
study resulted in the compilation of a draft Livestock Sector Policy, which was submitted in
November\u2019 1999 for consideration of the State Government.
During the next two years, the Fisheries & Animal Resources Development
Department, Government of Orissa, subjected the draft policy to a series of scrutiny and
consultation with scientists, professionals, farmers and agro-entrepreneurs, group wise or as
individuals. The policy was also examined by various related Government Departments.
As backstopping support, the Indo-Swiss NRM Programme Orissa conducted a study
on the possible implications of implementation of the Livestock Sector Policy, the outcome of
which was presented to the high-level officers of FARD and the Agricultural Production
Commissioner, it was also discussed in a workshop attended by Veterinary professionals of
the AHD, OMFED, various NGOs, Milk co-operatives and services associations of Veterinary
& Para-Veterinary professionals.
After the various rounds of revisions and adaptations, the Orissa State Livestock
Sector Policy, in the form as presented here, was sanctioned by the Chief Minister and the
Cabinet of Orissa on the 26th
of October 2002. It was indicated that the policy should be
dynamic and subject to a permanent process of objective scrutiny, testing it to the actual
developments in the sector, so as to revise it from time to time and update it to address the
prevailing situation.
