', History', [', edit', ]', 
', Origins', [', edit', ]', 
', Modern School was founded by Lala Raghubir Singh, an established and well to do resident of Delhi. He belonged to a Rajput family that had converted to Jainism and settled in Delhi. His father, Sultan Singh, was an accountant and banker (', khazanchi', ) with the Imperial Bank of India, and was well-regarded by both the British rulers and the Indian princes. In fact, Sultan Singh bequeathed his sprawling mansion with extensive grounds in Daryaganj for the purpose of establishing Modern School.', 
', Modern School was started in 1920 in a building located in ', Daryaganj', , New Delhi. It was a mansion that belonged to ', Rai Bahadur Lala Sultan Singh', u". He donated it to the school to fulfill his son's dream of establishing a school which would combine the traditions of Indian education with modern educational techniques. Sultan Singh was a prominent businessman in British India in the early 1880s. His son, ", Lala Raghubir Singh', , was the brain behind founding of the school.', 
', Founding Ethos', [', edit', ]', 
', Lala Raghubir Singh was the spirit and the soul of the school. The primary founder, he worked for the improvement of the school and in this endeavour he teamed up with Sardar ', Sobha Singh', . Sardar Sobha Singh was the co-founder of the school. A builder during the height of the ', Raj', , he was involved in the construction of buildings in Delhi like ', Connaught Place', , ', National Museum', , Modern School, ', South Block',  and ', India Gate', . His own two sons, Bhagwant Singh and ', Khushwant Singh',  (the noted writer) were amongst the first students of Modern School.', 
', Principals', [', edit', ]', 
', The first principal of Modern School was Mrs. Kamala Bose, a Bengali Christian, who travelled from Calcutta to accept the position.', 
', u"Modern School's most respected principal and mentor to a generation of students was Mr. M.N. Kapur.",

', The school is headed by a Board of Trustees, who appoint the Principal (Barakhamba Road and Vasant Vihar) and the Head Master (Humayun Road). It has 15 houses in the Barakhamba branch and eight houses in the Vasant Vihar branch, each headed by a housemaster.', 
', It has a 27-acre (110,000 m', 2', ) campus on ', Barakhamba Road', , near ', Connaught Place', .', 
', In 1932 there were about 125 students.', 
', In 1932, the school moved to a building in New Delhi built by ', Sir Sobha Singh', .', 
', [17]', 
', The words of ', Rabindranath Tagore',  are embodied in the philosophy of the founding fathers of Modern School. The Modern School was started in 1920 in ', Daryaganj', .', 
', The school motto is "Nyaymatma Balheenien Labhya" (in Sanskrit) meaning "Perfection Cannot be Achieved by the Weak"', 
', The Crest', [', edit', ]', 
', Designed by Sarada Ukil, an artist of great repute, and a teacher at Modern School in the 1920s,', [18]',  the school crest signifies the circle of eternity crossed by the three elements in human development: body, mind and spirit, as the sun shines between the triangle and the circle. Inside the triangle, there is a banyan tree to represent stability and firmness of character, the swan and the lotus represent refinement, culture and the arts which are fundamental elements of progress in life. The school slogan is Naimatma Balheenien Labhya, a Sanskrit quotation which when translated into English means "Self-realisation cannot be achieved by the weak."', [19]', [20]',  Besides the school motto, there are four words: truthfulness, unselfishness, frankness and self-control, which guide each child in their daily life.', 
', Campus', [', edit', ]', 
', The school occupies a single campus covering approximately twenty-five acres and is flanked by Maharaja Ranjit Singh Marg and Barakhamba Road in the heart of New Delhi. To house the school at its present location, Lala Raghubir Singh made an application with the government for a suitable site on 28 April 1921. In response to the application, the government allocated fifty acres of land in the ', Delhi Cantonment',  for the purposes of the school. Due to its location in ', Old Delhi', , the Cantonment was deemed far from the centre of the new city (at the time being constructed by ', Edwin Lutyens',  and ', Herbert Baker', ). Thus, after a second round of negotiations a twenty-five acre site was allotted in 1930 (the lease being finalized the same year on August 4) to provide accommodation for 200 resident boys with staff quarters and ample play-fields.', 
', The Main Building was designed by C.G. and F.B. Blomfield, architects on the team designing the ', imperial capital of New Delhi', . The white and red aesthetic of the Edwardian Classical building at Modern School resembles many Delhi structures of the period, such as ', Convent of Jesus and Mary', , ', u"St. Columba's School", , ', Sacred Heart Cathedral',  (designed by ', Henry Medd', ), Flagstaff House (now ', Teen Murti Bhavan', ), and ', Lady Irwin School', . It is now classified as a heritage structure and is an excellent example of British colonial architecture in New Delhi.', 
', Apart from the Main Building the campus includes the following: Sir Sobha Singh Block (informally ', S.S. Block', ), named after one of the co-founders of the school and accommodating classes nine and ten; the Platinum Jubilee Block (informally ', P.J.B.', u"), built to commemorate the school's seventy-fifth anniversary and home to classes eleven and twelve; the Baradari and Main Garden, which houses a fighter jet donated by an ex-Modernite; the Sir Shankar Lal Auditorium; the M.N. Kapur Hall (named after the second principal of the school) ; the Technology Block, which houses the Art Room, Sculpture, Pottery, and Wood Working Studios, the Drama Room, the Aero-modelling and Electronics Room, and the Home Economics Laboratory; the Principal's Bungalow; the Boys' Boarding House & Mess; Staff & Warden's Apartments; the Sanitarium; and the locus of all student activity, the Banyan Tree (informally ", B.T.', ). Entry and exit to the campus is strictly regulated through four gates, two of which are reserved for school buses, one for students, and the last one for staff.', 
', School Boarding: Golden Jubilee Hostel', [', edit', ]', 
', Modern School has a boarding house capable of housing 90 pupils. The boarding is single-gendered, and hence, boys only. The current In-charge of Pastoral Care is Lt. Col. (Retd.) Rajesh Menon. The boarding house is equipped with study rooms, a library, a gymnasium, a TV room, and a sanatorium.', [21]', 
', Houses', [', edit', ]', 
', Modern follows the house system. The school has fifteen houses, these are: Akbar, Ashoka, Azad, Gandhi, Lajpat, Laxmibai, Nehru, Patel, Pratap, Ranjit, Shastri, Shivaji, Subhash, Tagore, and Tilak. In keeping with founding ethos of the school and its nationalist leanings the houses honour significant figures in the history of India. Each house is assigned a Senior (classes nine to twelve) and Junior (classes six to eight) Housemaster.', 
', School Activities', [', edit', ]', 
', Sports', [', edit', ]', 
', Sports are an integral part of the school curriculum. The school has two large playing grounds, the Main Ground and the Cricket Field.

The football team is sponsored by ', Nike',  and the swimming and table tennis team by ', Reebok', . There is a golf academy by ', Taylor Made', [22]',  and also a tennis academy.', 
', Clubs and Societies', [', edit', ]', 
', Extracurricular activities are a compulsory element of school life at Modern. The school magazine, ', Sandesh', , is published each school term in English and Hindi (its sister publications include the ', Vasant Prayag',  at Modern School, Vasant Vihar, and ', Prayas',  at Modern School, Kundli). There are around twenty clubs and societies, including aero-modelling, drama, painting, sculpture, community service, carpentry, music, senior and junior English debating societies, economics, astronomy,', [23]',  computer science, physics,', [24]', u" and robotics. In many societies pupils come together to discuss a particular topic, presided over by a faculty member and often including a guest speaker. The school has often invited prominent figures to give speeches and talks to the students; these have included heads of state, politicians, ornithologists, naturalists, artists, writers, economists, diplomats, and industrialists. The Modern School Leadership lecture series invites prominent alumni to address the school assembly twice every school year. Major clubs include Bits 'N' Bytes (computer science), Debating Society, ", Interact Club', , ', SPIC MACAY', , and the SAPTAK.', [25]',

Its activities include donations to orphanages, recycling drives, ant-piracy drives, and an annual blood donation camp. The club has been awarded a certificate in recognition of its services to the community by ', Chief Minister of Delhi', , ', Shiela Dixit', .', [28]',  Interact Club occasionally nominates some of its students to be selected by Rotary International for its international program to represent India as Ambassador of Goodwill to neighboring countries such as Pakistan and Sri Lanka.The selected students stay as guests with families who participate in this international youth exchange program. SPIC MACAY, a national society for the promotion of Indian classical music and culture amongst youth, organizes a SPIC MACAY week every school term.', [29]',  Past performers include ', Pandit Shiv Kumar Sharma', , ', Ustad Bismillah Khan', , ', Sonal Mansingh', , ', Sitara Devi', , ', Ustad Amjad Ali Khan', , ', Hari Prasad Chaurasia', , and ', Birju Maharaj', .', [30]', [31]',  Other event organized include ', Cyclotron',  (the annual inter-school physics symposium) and ', Unquestionably Modern',  (a annual Quiz competition).

', School Magazine', [', edit', ]', 
', u"The Sandesh was compiled and edited by students of classes 11 & 12 under the expert guidance of Mrs. Malini Khatri. However, since the hostile takeover of Modern School on 7 July 2014 by Captain Haddock, things have changed. With arbitrary censorship undercutting creative and intellectual liberty, the magazine today functions as 'freely' as any publication did during the Emergency.", 
', Theatre and Music', [', edit', ]', 
', The school houses large venues for indoor productions, these are Sri Shankar Lal Auditorium, HLL (Hindustan Lever Limited) Auditorium, M.N. Kanpur Hall (formerly the gymnasium). Amphitheatre near prestigious Banyan tree is used for common musical evenings, etc.', 
', Traditions and Lore', [', edit', ]', 
', Like any established institution, Modern School has its fair share of traditions. For instance, during his tenure, Principal M.N. Kapur insisted all students sit cross legged on ', darris',  during morning assembly, a tradition that continues to this day. Drawing upon the longstanding relationship between Modern School and ', u"St. Stephen's College", , the Rudra Prize, established in 1928, honours ', S.K. Rudra', , the first Indian principal of ', u"St. Stephen's College",  and one of the founding members of the school.', 
', Affiliations', [', edit', ]', 
', Ties with other schools', [', edit', ]', 
', u"From its foundation in 1920, Modern School housed classes from Montessori to grade twelfth. This ended in 1961 when Raghubir Singh Junior Modern School was established on Humanyu Road, New Delhi, as the school's primary wing. In 1975, Modern School, Vasant Vihar was founded as the first sister school under the leadership of Mr. Ved Vyas, a well regarded", [34]', [35]',  Hindi teacher at Modern School, Barakhamba Road. Similarly, in 2014, another sister school was established in Kundli under the directorship of Mrs. Neelam Puri,', [36]', u" a former junior headmistress at Modern School, Barakhamba Road. In its foundational years the school also shared a close relationship with St. Stephen's College, New Delhi, but changing demographics, differing class structures, and quotas and reservations have distilled this association.", [37]',

The ', Model United nations',  conference organized by Modern is commonly known as ModMUN.', 
', Schools with similar names', [', edit', ]', 
', As private schools become more widespread in India, several other schools use "Modern" as part of their names, causing some confusion.

', History', [', edit', ]', 
', Origins', [', edit', ]', 
', Modern School was founded by Lala Raghubir Singh, an established and well to do resident of Delhi. He belonged to a Rajput family that had converted to Jainism and settled in Delhi. His father, Sultan Singh, was an accountant and banker (', khazanchi', ) with the Imperial Bank of India, and was well-regarded by both the British rulers and the Indian princes. In fact, Sultan Singh bequeathed his sprawling mansion with extensive grounds in Daryaganj for the purpose of establishing Modern School.', 
', Modern School was started in 1920 in a building located in ', Daryaganj', , New Delhi. It was a mansion that belonged to ', Rai Bahadur Lala Sultan Singh', u". He donated it to the school to fulfill his son's dream of establishing a school which would combine the traditions of Indian education with modern educational techniques. Sultan Singh was a prominent businessman in British India in the early 1880s. His son, ", Lala Raghubir Singh', , was the brain behind founding of the school.', 
', Founding Ethos', [', edit', ]', 
', Lala Raghubir Singh was the spirit and the soul of the school. The primary founder, he worked for the improvement of the school and in this endeavour he teamed up with Sardar ', Sobha Singh', . Sardar Sobha Singh was the co-founder of the school. A builder during the height of the ', Raj', , he was involved in the construction of buildings in Delhi like ', Connaught Place', , ', National Museum', , Modern School, ', South Block',  and ', India Gate', . His own two sons, Bhagwant Singh and ', Khushwant Singh',  (the noted writer) were amongst the first students of Modern School.', 
', Principals', [', edit', ]', 
', The first principal of Modern School was Mrs. Kamala Bose, a Bengali Christian, who travelled from Calcutta to accept the position.', 
', u"Modern School's most respected principal and mentor to a generation of students was Mr. M.N. Kapur.",

', The school is headed by a Board of Trustees, who appoint the Principal (Barakhamba Road and Vasant Vihar) and the Head Master (Humayun Road). It has 15 houses in the Barakhamba branch and eight houses in the Vasant Vihar branch, each headed by a housemaster.', 
', It has a 27-acre (110,000 m', 2', ) campus on ', Barakhamba Road', , near ', Connaught Place', .', 
', In 1932 there were about 125 students.', 
', In 1932, the school moved to a building in New Delhi built by ', Sir Sobha Singh', .', 
', [17]', 
', The words of ', Rabindranath Tagore',  are embodied in the philosophy of the founding fathers of Modern School. The Modern School was started in 1920 in ', Daryaganj', .', 
', The school motto is "Nyaymatma Balheenien Labhya" (in Sanskrit) meaning "Perfection Cannot be Achieved by the Weak"', 
', The Crest', [', edit', ]', 
', Designed by Sarada Ukil, an artist of great repute, and a teacher at Modern School in the 1920s,', [18]',  the school crest signifies the circle of eternity crossed by the three elements in human development: body, mind and spirit, as the sun shines between the triangle and the circle. Inside the triangle, there is a banyan tree to represent stability and firmness of character, the swan and the lotus represent refinement, culture and the arts which are fundamental elements of progress in life. The school slogan is Naimatma Balheenien Labhya, a Sanskrit quotation which when translated into English means "Self-realisation cannot be achieved by the weak."', [19]', [20]',  Besides the school motto, there are four words: truthfulness, unselfishness, frankness and self-control, which guide each child in their daily life.', 
', Campus', [', edit', ]', 
', The school occupies a single campus covering approximately twenty-five acres and is flanked by Maharaja Ranjit Singh Marg and Barakhamba Road in the heart of New Delhi. To house the school at its present location, Lala Raghubir Singh made an application with the government for a suitable site on 28 April 1921. In response to the application, the government allocated fifty acres of land in the ', Delhi Cantonment',  for the purposes of the school. Due to its location in ', Old Delhi', , the Cantonment was deemed far from the centre of the new city (at the time being constructed by ', Edwin Lutyens',  and ', Herbert Baker', ). Thus, after a second round of negotiations a twenty-five acre site was allotted in 1930 (the lease being finalized the same year on August 4) to provide accommodation for 200 resident boys with staff quarters and ample play-fields.', 
', The Main Building was designed by C.G. and F.B. Blomfield, architects on the team designing the ', imperial capital of New Delhi', . The white and red aesthetic of the Edwardian Classical building at Modern School resembles many Delhi structures of the period, such as ', Convent of Jesus and Mary', , ', u"St. Columba's School", , ', Sacred Heart Cathedral',  (designed by ', Henry Medd', ), Flagstaff House (now ', Teen Murti Bhavan', ), and ', Lady Irwin School', . It is now classified as a heritage structure and is an excellent example of British colonial architecture in New Delhi.', 
', Apart from the Main Building the campus includes the following: Sir Sobha Singh Block (informally ', S.S. Block', ), named after one of the co-founders of the school and accommodating classes nine and ten; the Platinum Jubilee Block (informally ', P.J.B.', u"), built to commemorate the school's seventy-fifth anniversary and home to classes eleven and twelve; the Baradari and Main Garden, which houses a fighter jet donated by an ex-Modernite; the Sir Shankar Lal Auditorium; the M.N. Kapur Hall (named after the second principal of the school) ; the Technology Block, which houses the Art Room, Sculpture, Pottery, and Wood Working Studios, the Drama Room, the Aero-modelling and Electronics Room, and the Home Economics Laboratory; the Principal's Bungalow; the Boys' Boarding House & Mess; Staff & Warden's Apartments; the Sanitarium; and the locus of all student activity, the Banyan Tree (informally ", B.T.', ). Entry and exit to the campus is strictly regulated through four gates, two of which are reserved for school buses, one for students, and the last one for staff.', 
', School Boarding: Golden Jubilee Hostel', [', edit', ]', 
', Modern School has a boarding house capable of housing 90 pupils. The boarding is single-gendered, and hence, boys only. The current In-charge of Pastoral Care is Lt. Col. (Retd.) Rajesh Menon. The boarding house is equipped with study rooms, a library, a gymnasium, a TV room, and a sanatorium.', [21]', 
', Houses', [', edit', ]', 
', Modern follows the house system. The school has fifteen houses, these are: Akbar, Ashoka, Azad, Gandhi, Lajpat, Laxmibai, Nehru, Patel, Pratap, Ranjit, Shastri, Shivaji, Subhash, Tagore, and Tilak. In keeping with founding ethos of the school and its nationalist leanings the houses honour significant figures in the history of India. Each house is assigned a Senior (classes nine to twelve) and Junior (classes six to eight) Housemaster.', 
', School Activities', [', edit', ]', 
', Sports', [', edit', ]', 
', Sports are an integral part of the school curriculum. The school has two large playing grounds, the Main Ground and the Cricket Field. Hockey, cricket, athletics, basketball, and association football are played throughout the school year. Tennis, table tennis, badminton, squash, and swimming are also available. Sport is dominated by basketball, hockey, cricket, and association football, in which the schools competes nationally, at the state-level, and in inter-school and inter-house competitions. Sports facilities include an Olympic-size swimming pool, six ', clay',  tennis courts, three squash courts, two outdoor basketball courts +one indoor, facilities for indoor badminton and table tennis, two cricket pitches, two fields for hockey and football (which can be converted to cricket pitches to accommodate seasonal sports), and an athletic track. The football team is sponsored by ', Nike',  and the swimming and table tennis team by ', Reebok', . There is a golf academy by ', Taylor Made', [22]',  and also a tennis academy.', 
', Clubs and Societies', [', edit', ]', 
', Extracurricular activities are a compulsory element of school life at Modern. The school magazine, ', Sandesh', , is published each school term in English and Hindi (its sister publications include the ', Vasant Prayag',  at Modern School, Vasant Vihar, and ', Prayas',  at Modern School, Kundli). There are around twenty clubs and societies, including aero-modelling, drama, painting, sculpture, community service, carpentry, music, senior and junior English debating societies, economics, astronomy,', [23]',  computer science, physics,', [24]', u" and robotics. In many societies pupils come together to discuss a particular topic, presided over by a faculty member and often including a guest speaker. The school has often invited prominent figures to give speeches and talks to the students; these have included heads of state, politicians, ornithologists, naturalists, artists, writers, economists, diplomats, and industrialists. The Modern School Leadership lecture series invites prominent alumni to address the school assembly twice every school year. Major clubs include Bits 'N' Bytes (computer science), Debating Society, ", Interact Club', , ', SPIC MACAY', , and the SAPTAK.', [25]', 
', u"Bits 'N' Bytes is one of the oldest school societies dating back to 1988. It organizes ACCESS, an annual tech symposium, in the month of December. In 2013, the society won the ", TCS IT Wiz',  and simultaneously celebrated its Silver Jubilee.', [26]',  The Debating Society is very active during the school year, as it hosts the Raghubir Singh Inter-school Debate, the Pratap Singh Inter-school Debate, and usually helps organize the Annual MSOSA Inter-school Debate.', [27]', u" Interact Club ( affiliate club of Rotary International's service club for students between the age of 12-18 ) was inaugurated in 1983 by the then Vice-President of India, ", Muhammad Hidayat Ullah', , and has since grown into a prominent school society.
