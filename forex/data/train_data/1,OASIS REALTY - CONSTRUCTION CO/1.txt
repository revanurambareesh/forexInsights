        ', Six Simple Things You Can Do to Ensure a Smooth Home Purchase', 
        ', Close', 
      ', 
      ', 
        ', 
          Buying a
            home can be an emotional, time-consuming, and complex process. There
            are a few things that you can do to help make the process go as
            smooth as possible: ', 
            ', 
            ', 1. Check your credit.', u"
            Before you apply for a home loan, regardless of your credit, it's a
            smart idea to obtain a copy of your credit report from the three
            major credit bureaus and review the information. If there are errors
            or things that need to be addressed, it's easier to address them
            before you have found a house, than after you have found a house and
            are trying to close your loan.", 
            ', 
            If you know that there are a few blemishes on your credit, let your
            lender know what they are, why they are there, and why you are a
            still good credit risk. Lenders look at your credit to determine how
            likely you will pay back the loan. If you had extenuating
            circumstances - like a loss of a job or medical bills - let them
            know so that they understand that it is not likely to happen again
            in the future.', 
            ', 
            ', 2. Get approved before you buy.', 
            An approval means that a lender has reviewed your credit history,
            verified your assets and employment, and has approved your loan
            before you have found a home to purchase. As long as the home
            appraises for at least the purchase price, the loan should close.', 
            ', 
            Getting approved also gives you an advantage over other buyers. Your
            firm approval makes it easier for you to negotiate on the price of a
            home, than a person who is not approved or is pre-qualified.', 
            ', 
            While getting pre-qualified may sound official, it is really just
            getting an idea of what you can afford. Its having a person plug in
            a few numbers that you give them - your monthly income and your
            monthly debt - and getting an approximate payment calculated. From
            the payment, the calculator can approximate the house price range
            that you can afford. No information is verified. Because your
            assets, income or credit is not verified, a pre-qualification has
            little value when purchasing a home.', 
            ', 
            ', u"3. Find a great buyer's agent.", u"
            Traditionally real estate agents represent the sellers in a
            transaction. When you are not working with a buyer's agent, they are
            less likely to negotiate the best price or contingencies for you.", 
            ', u"
            A buyer's agent's job and fiduciary responsibility (meaning legal
            duty) is to you, the buyer. Before working with an agent, establish
            if they are a buyer's agent or a seller's agent. After spending a
            lot of time with a Realtor, it's natural to feel like yore a team.
            But if they are not negotiating for you, then they are not on your
            team.", 
            ', 
            ', 4. Learn about the neighborhood.', u"
            Often times the house you find may be in a neighborhood that yore
            not familiar with, which is ok. It just means that yoll have to do
            a little more research. If you find a house that you like, ask for a
            list of the neighborhood properties that sold in the last year. How
            does your home rank? Is it at the top of the price range? If so, it
            might be hard to resell. Is it average or on the low end? If so,
            great - as the other home prices go up in value, they will pull your
            home's value up as well.", 
            ', 
            Check out the schools - are they sought after? A good school
            district means your neighborhood will always be valued by families
            which is a great reassurance to purchase, not to mention the
            value-add if you have school-age children.', 
            ', u"
            Next, contact the police station and obtain crime statistics? Are
            they acceptable to you? Sometimes, if they won't give them to you,
            it could be a cause for alarm.", 
            ', 
            Talk to the neighbors. The more people you talk to, the better sense
            you will get of who makes up the neighborhood and how they will
            effect your time spent in it.', 
            ', 
            Check out the location of the shopping, police and fire stations,
            schools, and air traffic overhead. These are all things that might
            affect your property value or quality of your life.', 
            ', 
            ', 5. Protect Yourself.', u"
            Ask your Realtor for a copy of the documents you will be asked to
            sign if you decide to buy the house. Read them ahead of time so that
            yoll understand the questions that you will be asked, the things
            you need to know, and the decisions you will need to make.", 
            ', 
            ', 6.) Have reasonable expectations.', 
            There is a lot of money at stake. No house is perfect. Understanding
            and remembering these two statements will help diffuse the
            negotiation stage, the inspection stage and the closing stage.', 
            ', u"
            Emotions are high for both buyers and sellers. - The seller may have
            loving memories and years of sweat equity in the house. Maybe they
            are being relocated and don't want to go. Understanding their
            motivations for selling will help you appreciate their situation and
            predicament during these emotional times.", 
            ', 
            There is a lot of money at stake for all the parties involved (and
            that includes the realtors) - Just remember that market value (the
            value of a home) is the price that a willing buyer and a willing
            seller can agree to. If you can not agree on a price, ask yourself:
            Is there something you missed? Are there comparables that support
            the price that they want? Are there motivations that might factor
            into the price they are demanding? In the end, does it matter? What
            is the house worth to you today and what do you think you can
            reasonably sell it for based on the amount of time you plan to spend
            in it? Think about the answers to those questions before you make
            your move.', 
            ', u"
            No house is perfect - Always get an inspection. It might be a few
            hundred dollars, but it's worth it. It's the inspector's job to find
            any problems with the house that could cost you thousands to repair
            down the road. Some inspectors have a tendency to over play the
            importance of their role and the items that they find. Get objective
            opinions that you trust before making a decision on an inspection
            report. Likewise, if an inspector says a foundation is cracked but
            its nothing to worry about - get a second opinion. Ask a handyman
            for an idea of how much repairs will cost and how complicated they
            are. The home buying process is an emotional, complex and

              to move after only a short time, you may end up paying
              money in order to sell it. The value of your home may
              not have appreciated enough to cover the costs that you
              paid to buy the home and the costs that it would take

              the home. Most parts of the country have an average of
              5% appreciation per year. In this case, you should plan
              to stay in your home at least 3-4 years to cover buying
              and selling costs. If the area you buy your home in
              experiences an economic up turn, the length of the time
              to cover these costs could be shortened, and the

              lend you money, solid lenders are more skeptical if your

              less of a payment tomorrow. This is a decision only you
              can make. Are you in a position where you expect to make
              more money soon? Would you rather be conservative and

              what you may qualify for. Then call a lender. While some
              may say that the "28/36" rule applies, in today's home
              mortgage market, lenders are making loans customized to
              a particular person's situation. The "28/36" rule means
              that your monthly housing costs can't exceed 28 percent
              of your income and your total debt load can't exceed 36
              percent of your total monthly income. Depending on your
              assets, credit history, job potential and other factors,
              lenders can push the ratios up to 40-60% or higher.
              While we're not advocating you purchase a home utilizing
              the higher ratios, its important for you to know your

              down payment is not always necessary - if you can prove

              credit isn't stellar but you have managed to save 10-20%

                  Every seller obviously wants to get the most money for his or
                  her product. Ironically, the best way to do this is NOT to
                  list your product at an excessively high price! A high listing
                  price will cause some prospective buyers to lose interest
                  before even seeing your property. Also, it may lead other
                  buyers to expect more than what you have to offer. As a
                  result, overpriced properties tend to take an unusually long
                  time to sell, and they end up being sold at a lower price.

                  Unfortunately, a re-finance appraisal may have been stated at
                  an untruthfully high price. Often, lenders estimate the value
                  of your property to be higher than it actually is in order to
                  encourage re-financing. The market value of your home could
                  actually be lower. Your best bet is to ask your realtor for
                  the most recent information regarding property sales in your
                  community. This will give you an up-to-date and factually

                  uses: open houses and classified ads. Unfortunately, these two
                  tools are rather ineffective. Less than 1% of homes are sold
                  at open houses, and less than 3% are sold because of
                  classified ads. In fact, realtors often use open houses to

                  involved. From choosing the right mortgage, to finding a home
                  inspector, to viewing available properties, there are many steps
                  involved for even the hardiest person. With a professional
                  realtor on your side, you\u2019ll have access to these services,
                  already in place, and highly recommended. A good agent has the
                  knowledge and experience developed from many years of helping
                  both buyers and sellers. During this time they have developed a
                  network of people, from lenders, lawyers, home inspectors and
                  movers, to assist both home buyers and sellers.

                  Spending time with your Realtor will reap huge dividends. When
                  you have a clear picture of the type of home you\u2019re looking for,
                  your Realtor can come closer to finding the home you want. You

                  sound like a broken record. That\u2019s because it\u2019s true! A home is
                  not a stand alone item. Rather the value of a home is greatly
                  affected by the surrounding homes. Don\u2019t let your emotions
                  determine your purchase. Think resale. The desirability and
                  resale value of your home depends largely on location more than
                  any other factor. People want a desirable community that
                  includes character, quality of schools, access to work, major
                  transportation arteries, recreational facilities, etc.
                  ', 
                  On your viewing trips, take a careful look and ask the following
                  questions: How does this home compare to others in the
                  neighborhood? Are yards fenced? Are there many children playing
                  in the streets? Are front and backyards and the exterior of the
                  homes properly maintained?
                  ', 
                  Walk around the neighborhood and get a feel for the people living in
                  the area. You may want to speak with a few neighbors to get
                  their comments. If you like the community, carefully examine the
                  home you like. Generally speaking, extremely large homes
                  surrounded by smaller homes tend to appreciate less than a large
                  home among other large homes. Alternatively, the smallest home
                  in the neighborhood tends to stand out by the other homes on the
                  block. Sometimes, it could take a bit longer to sell a smaller
                  home, as some people are reluctant to pay extra for the
                  neighborhood.
                  ', 
                  Additional factors that affect the property value of a home
                  include traffic, sounds, smells, zoning bylaws. Be objective.
                  Don\u2019t rely too heavily on your emotions. Be sure you are
                  completely satisfied with the neighborhood. If you choose a
                  neighborhood with problems, you likely won\u2019t get as much as you
                  hoped with it comes time to sell.

                  including understanding supply and demand, economics and the
                  neighborhoods of the city in which they practice. As they
                  regularly view homes as they are placed on the market, they are
                  at the heartbeat of knowledge and information about housing
                  trends and prices. They can save you time and money, by
                  narrowing your prospects to only those that meet your
                  requirements. It is a very time consuming process to view every
                  home available that meets your needs. A professional Realtor can
                  do much of the work for you, by reviewing your needs, reviewing
                  the properties and then hopefully, advising you of a potential
                  match. A comprehensive knowledge of the available homes in your
                  neighborhood is one of your Realtor\u2019s strongest assets. With the
                  aid of computerized systems, a Realtor is notified within hours
                  when a home becomes available.

                  home is an emotional process. It could be costly. Using your

                  Some people may be inclined towards purchasing a home that needs
                  some work. This could be a challenge and an opportunity to make
                  money. Sometimes, a fixer-upper can be purchased below market
                  value, and sufficient repairs made to bring it to a good sale
                  condition with a profit realized. However not all fixer uppers
                  will bring in the profits you might expect. It depends upon the
                  price of the home, the amount of repairs needed and the market
                  conditions at the time of sale. If the home is not priced low
                  enough, you may not recover your investment of time, trouble and
                  money. Before you purchase what looks like a quick way to
                  profit, carefully consider the condition of the home and ALL the
                  repairs that need to be made. Get several estimates. Complete a
                  comprehensive budget. Also consult with your Realtor. He or she
                  can give you an idea of what you can reasonably, expect to
                  recover when the home is put back on the market.

                  moving back home? Perhaps it may be easier and less expensive if
                  you purchase a home that can meet these needs now, rather than
                  moving up to a larger home a few years later.

                  been transferred to another city, may be more motivated to sell

                  make a list of what needs to be done. Consider what your
                  property looks like to people driving by or walking through
                  your door. What will they like or dislike? What needs fixing,
                  painting, cleaning? What can you improve? Whether you paint
                  your house or fix up the yard, your efforts don\u2019t need to be
                  costly; even inexpensive improvements and minor repairs go far
                  toward attracting serious buyers. But remember, those
                  seemingly insignificant problems you\u2019ve learned to live with
                  can actually discourage potential buyers. Here are ideas for
                  increasing your home\u2019s appeal in order to sell it quickly at
                  the best price.',

                  Buyers expect a spotless house, inside and out. So clean
                  everything, especially your windows and window sills. Scrub
                  walls and floors, tile and ceilings, cupboards and drawers,
                  kitchen and bathrooms. Wash scuff marks from doors and
                  entryways, clean light fixtures and the fireplace. Don\u2019t
                  forget the laundry room. And put away your clothes.

                  People are turned off by rooms that look and feel cluttered.
                  Remember, potential buyers are buying your house, not your
                  furniture, so help them picture themselves and their
                  possessions in your home by making your rooms feel large,
                  light, and airy. As you clean, pack away your personal items,
                  such as pictures, valuables, and collectibles, and store or
                  get rid of surplus books, magazines, videotapes, extra
                  furniture, rugs, blankets, etc. Consider renting a storage
                  unit to eliminate clutter in your garage and attic.

                  It\u2019s hard to get rid of possessions, but cleaning and clearing
                  out the clutter can really pay off in the end. Packing away
                  your clutter also gets you started packing for your next move.
                  Make your garage and basement as tidy as the rest of your
                  house. Simple little tasks such as storing your tools and
                  neatly rolling up your garden hose suggest that you take good
                  care of your house. Don\u2019t let anything detract from making

                  A new coat of paint cleans up your living space and makes it
                  look bright and new. To make rooms look larger, choose light,
                  neutral colors that appeal to the most people, such as beige

                  Again, light, neutral colors, such as beige, are best. If you
                  don\u2019t replace it, you can suggest to potential buyers that
                  they could select new carpet and you\u2019ll reduce your price;

                  selling price. Make minor repairs to items such as leaky
                  faucets, slow drains, torn screens, gutters, loose doorknobs,
                  and broken windows. Make sure repairs are well done; buyers

                  The "Wow" factor ?that first visual, high-impact impression

                  buyer. To determine your property\u2019s curb appeal, drive through
                  your neighborhood and note other properties; then approach
                  your own house as if you were a potential buyer. How does it
                  look? Does it "wow" you? Will its curb appeal attract buyers?
                  Note what needs improving, such as trimming trees, planting
                  shrubs, or painting gutters. Little things convey that you\u2019ve
                  cared for your home, and this is your opportunity to sell that

        ', Close', 
      ', 
      ', 
        ', 
          Buying a
            home can be an emotional, time-consuming, and complex process. There
            are a few things that you can do to help make the process go as
            smooth as possible: ', 
            ', 
            ', 1. Check your credit.', u"
            Before you apply for a home loan, regardless of your credit, it's a
            smart idea to obtain a copy of your credit report from the three
            major credit bureaus and review the information. If there are errors
            or things that need to be addressed, it's easier to address them
            before you have found a house, than after you have found a house and
            are trying to close your loan.", 
            ', 
            If you know that there are a few blemishes on your credit, let your
            lender know what they are, why they are there, and why you are a
            still good credit risk. Lenders look at your credit to determine how
            likely you will pay back the loan. If you had extenuating
            circumstances - like a loss of a job or medical bills - let them
            know so that they understand that it is not likely to happen again
            in the future.', 
            ', 
            ', 2. Get approved before you buy.', 
            An approval means that a lender has reviewed your credit history,
            verified your assets and employment, and has approved your loan
            before you have found a home to purchase. As long as the home
            appraises for at least the purchase price, the loan should close.', 
            ', 
            Getting approved also gives you an advantage over other buyers. Your
            firm approval makes it easier for you to negotiate on the price of a
            home, than a person who is not approved or is pre-qualified.', 
            ', 
            While getting pre-qualified may sound official, it is really just
            getting an idea of what you can afford. Its having a person plug in
            a few numbers that you give them - your monthly income and your
            monthly debt - and getting an approximate payment calculated. From
            the payment, the calculator can approximate the house price range
            that you can afford. No information is verified. Because your
            assets, income or credit is not verified, a pre-qualification has
            little value when purchasing a home.', 
            ', 
            ', u"3. Find a great buyer's agent.", u"
            Traditionally real estate agents represent the sellers in a
            transaction. When you are not working with a buyer's agent, they are
            less likely to negotiate the best price or contingencies for you.", 
            ', u"
            A buyer's agent's job and fiduciary responsibility (meaning legal
            duty) is to you, the buyer. Before working with an agent, establish
            if they are a buyer's agent or a seller's agent. After spending a
            lot of time with a Realtor, it's natural to feel like yore a team.
            But if they are not negotiating for you, then they are not on your
            team.", 
            ', 
            ', 4. Learn about the neighborhood.', u"
            Often times the house you find may be in a neighborhood that yore
            not familiar with, which is ok. It just means that yoll have to do
            a little more research. If you find a house that you like, ask for a
            list of the neighborhood properties that sold in the last year. How
            does your home rank? Is it at the top of the price range? If so, it
            might be hard to resell. Is it average or on the low end? If so,
            great - as the other home prices go up in value, they will pull your
            home's value up as well.", 
            ', 
            Check out the schools - are they sought after? A good school
            district means your neighborhood will always be valued by families
            which is a great reassurance to purchase, not to mention the
            value-add if you have school-age children.', 
            ', u"
            Next, contact the police station and obtain crime statistics? Are
            they acceptable to you? Sometimes, if they won't give them to you,
            it could be a cause for alarm.",

            importance of their role and the items that they find. Get objective
            opinions that you trust before making a decision on an inspection

            its nothing to worry about - get a second opinion. Ask a handyman
            for an idea of how much repairs will cost and how complicated they
            are. The home buying process is an emotional, complex and
            time-consuming process, but it is worth it. Nothing compares to
            owning your own home in a neighborhood that you chose.

              may say that the "28/36" rule applies, in today's home
              mortgage market, lenders are making loans customized to
              a particular person's situation. The "28/36" rule means
              that your monthly housing costs can't exceed 28 percent
              of your income and your total debt load can't exceed 36
              percent of your total monthly income. Depending on your
              assets, credit history, job potential and other factors,
              lenders can push the ratios up to 40-60% or higher.
              While we're not advocating you purchase a home utilizing

                  her product. Ironically, the best way to do this is NOT to
                  list your product at an excessively high price! A high listing
                  price will cause some prospective buyers to lose interest
                  before even seeing your property. Also, it may lead other
                  buyers to expect more than what you have to offer. As a
                  result, overpriced properties tend to take an unusually long
                  time to sell, and they end up being sold at a lower price.

                  an untruthfully high price. Often, lenders estimate the value
                  of your property to be higher than it actually is in order to
                  encourage re-financing. The market value of your home could
                  actually be lower. Your best bet is to ask your realtor for
                  the most recent information regarding property sales in your
                  community. This will give you an up-to-date and factually

                  resale value of your home depends largely on location more than

                  includes character, quality of schools, access to work, major

                  in the streets? Are front and backyards and the exterior of the

                  their comments. If you like the community, carefully examine the
                  home you like. Generally speaking, extremely large homes
                  surrounded by smaller homes tend to appreciate less than a large
                  home among other large homes. Alternatively, the smallest home
                  in the neighborhood tends to stand out by the other homes on the
                  block. Sometimes, it could take a bit longer to sell a smaller
                  home, as some people are reluctant to pay extra for the
                  neighborhood.

                  completely satisfied with the neighborhood. If you choose a

                  condition with a profit realized. However not all fixer uppers
                  will bring in the profits you might expect. It depends upon the

                  conditions at the time of sale. If the home is not priced low
                  enough, you may not recover your investment of time, trouble and
                  money. Before you purchase what looks like a quick way to
                  profit, carefully consider the condition of the home and ALL the
                  repairs that need to be made. Get several estimates. Complete a
                  comprehensive budget. Also consult with your Realtor. He or she

                  appraisal fees, legal fees, inspection fees, transfer taxes,
                  title insurance, inspections, etc. Your Realtor can give you a
                  good idea of the costs associated with buying a home that are
                  beyond the final negotiated price of your home.

                  A spruced up house makes a great first impression on potential
                  buyers. An attractive property grabs their attention and makes
                  them excited about finding a house that looks and feels
                  well-cared for. Because buyers know they\u2019ll encounter fewer
                  problems if they buy it, your house becomes more appealing and
                  stands out from the competition. So if you prepare your home
                  correctly, you\u2019ll save time selling it when it\u2019s on the
                  market.',

                  A good first impression makes an impact on a number of levels.

                  Create a plan to enhance your property. Keep a notebook for
                  your selling project, and as you stroll through your yard,
                  make a list of what needs to be done. Consider what your
                  property looks like to people driving by or walking through
                  your door. What will they like or dislike? What needs fixing,
                  painting, cleaning? What can you improve? Whether you paint
                  your house or fix up the yard, your efforts don\u2019t need to be
                  costly; even inexpensive improvements and minor repairs go far
                  toward attracting serious buyers. But remember, those
                  seemingly insignificant problems you\u2019ve learned to live with
                  can actually discourage potential buyers. Here are ideas for
                  increasing your home\u2019s appeal in order to sell it quickly at
                  the best price.',

                  Buyers expect a spotless house, inside and out. So clean
                  everything, especially your windows and window sills. Scrub
                  walls and floors, tile and ceilings, cupboards and drawers,
                  kitchen and bathrooms. Wash scuff marks from doors and
                  entryways, clean light fixtures and the fireplace. Don\u2019t
                  forget the laundry room. And put away your clothes.

                  People are turned off by rooms that look and feel cluttered.
                  Remember, potential buyers are buying your house, not your
                  furniture, so help them picture themselves and their
                  possessions in your home by making your rooms feel large,
                  light, and airy. As you clean, pack away your personal items,
                  such as pictures, valuables, and collectibles, and store or
                  get rid of surplus books, magazines, videotapes, extra
                  furniture, rugs, blankets, etc. Consider renting a storage
                  unit to eliminate clutter in your garage and attic.

                  It\u2019s hard to get rid of possessions, but cleaning and clearing
                  out the clutter can really pay off in the end. Packing away
                  your clutter also gets you started packing for your next move.
                  Make your garage and basement as tidy as the rest of your
                  house. Simple little tasks such as storing your tools and
                  neatly rolling up your garden hose suggest that you take good
                  care of your house. Don\u2019t let anything detract from making

                  A new coat of paint cleans up your living space and makes it
                  look bright and new. To make rooms look larger, choose light,
                  neutral colors that appeal to the most people, such as beige

                  Again, light, neutral colors, such as beige, are best. If you
                  don\u2019t replace it, you can suggest to potential buyers that
                  they could select new carpet and you\u2019ll reduce your price;

                  selling price. Make minor repairs to items such as leaky
                  faucets, slow drains, torn screens, gutters, loose doorknobs,
                  and broken windows. Make sure repairs are well done; buyers

                  your own house as if you were a potential buyer. How does it

                  shrubs, or painting gutters. Little things convey that you\u2019ve
