HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE R.V. EASWAR

SANJIV KHANNA, J.
", 
',       Joshi Technologies International Inc., a company incorporated in

the United States of America seeks mandamus that they are entitled to

benefit under ', Section 42',  of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (Act, for short) in

respect of the two Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs, in short) both

dated 20th February, 1995 for Oil Fields in Dholka and Wavell, Gujarat.

', 2.    The factual background in brief is that the petitioner along with

Larsen & Toubro Ltd., (who subsequently assigned and transferred their

rights in favour of the petitioner), were successful bidders in the Notice

Inviting Tender, dated 31st December, 1992 ("1992 NIT").               The

"petroleum profit" was/is to be shared as per the terms of the PSC
', WPC 5716/2008                                           Page 1 of 21', 
 between the Government of India, Ministry of Petroleum and Natural

Gas and the petitioner.   The two PSCs have duration of 18 years from

their effective date and have extension provisions.

', 3.    The petitioner in the returns for the Assessment Years 2001-02,

2003-04 and 2004-05, claimed and was allowed deductions under

', Section 42',  of the Act. However, in respect of the assessment year 2005-

06, the Assessing Officer denied benefit under ', Section 42',  vide order

dated 31st December, 2007. Several other additions were made. This

had resulted in an additional demand of Rs.1,24,45,509/-. The petitioner

has filed an appeal against the assessment order before the appellate

authority. It appears that the appeal is pending.
', 
', 4.    The Assessing Officer has also issued notices for re-assessment in

respect of Assessment years 2001-02, 2002-03, 2003-04 and 2004-05, on

the ground that the petitioner was wrongly given benefit of deduction

under ', Section 42',  of the Act in the said years.
', 
', 5.    ', Section 42',  of the Act reads as under:-
', 
',           "42. Special provision for deductions in the case
          of business for prospecting, etc., for mineral oil.--
          [1]For the purpose of computing the profits or
          gains of any business consisting of the prospecting
          for or extraction or production of mineral oils in
          relation to which the Central Government has
          entered into an agreement with any person for the
          association or participation of the Central
          Government or any person authorised by it in such
          business (which agreement has been laid on the
          table of each House of Parliament), there shall be
', WPC 5716/2008                                           Page 2 of 21', 
           made in lieu of, or in addition to, the allowances
          admissible under this Act, such allowances as are
          specified in the agreement in relation--
', 
',           (a) to expenditure by way of infructuous or
          abortive exploration expenses in respect of any
          area surrendered prior to the beginning of
          commercial production by the assessee;
', 
',           (b) after the beginning of commercial production,
          to expenditure incurred by the assessee, whether
          before or after such commercial production, in
          respect of drilling or exploration activities or
          services or in respect of physical assets used in that
          connection, except assets on which allowance for
          depreciation is admissible under ', Section 32', :
', 
',           Provided that in relation to any agreement entered
          into after the 31st day of March, 1981, this clause
          shall have effect subject to the modification that the
          words and figures "except assets on which
          allowance for depreciation is admissible under
          ', Section 32', " had been omitted; and

',           (c) to the depletion of mineral oil in the mining
          area in respect of the assessment year relevant to
          the previous year in which commercial production
          is begun and for such succeeding year or years as
          may be specified in the agreement, and such
          allowances shall be computed and made in the
          manner specified in the agreement, the other
          provisions of this Act being deemed for this
          purpose to have been modified to the extent
          necessary to give effect to the terms of the
          agreement.
',           Explanation.--For the purposes of this section,
          "mineral oil" includes petroleum and natural gas.
          [(2) Where the business of the assessee consisting
          of the prospecting for or extraction or production
          of petroleum and natural gas is transferred wholly
          or partly or any interest in such business is
          transferred in accordance with the agreement
          referred to in sub-section (1), subject to the
', WPC 5716/2008                                             Page 3 of 21', 
           provisions of the said agreement and where the
          proceeds of the transfer (so far as they consist of
          capital sums)--
', 
',           (a) are less than the expenditure incurred
          remaining unallowed, a deduction equal to such
          expenditure remaining unallowed, as reduced by
          the proceeds of transfer, shall be allowed in respect
          of the previous year in which such business or
          interest, as the case may be, is transferred;
', 
',           (b) exceed the amount of the expenditure incurred
          remaining unallowed, so much of the excess as
          does not exceed the difference between the
          expenditure incurred in connection with the
          business or to obtain interest therein and the
          amount of such expenditure remaining unallowed,
          shall be chargeable to income tax as profits and
          gains of the business in the previous year in which
          the business or interest therein, whether wholly or
          partly, had been transferred:
', 
',           Provided that in a case where the provisions of this
          clause do not apply, the deduction to be allowed
          for expenditure incurred remaining unallowed
          shall be arrived at by subtracting the proceeds of
          transfer (so far as they consist of capital sums)
          from the expenditure remaining unallowed.
', 
',           Explanation.--Where the business or interest in
          such business is transferred in a previous year in
          which such business carried on by the assessee is
          no longer in existence, the provisions of this clause
          shall apply as if the business is in existence in that
          previous year;
', 
',           (c) are not less than the amount of the expenditure
          incurred remaining unallowed, no deduction for
          such expenditure shall be allowed in respect of the
          previous year in which the business or interest in
          such business is transferred or in respect of any
          subsequent year or years:
', 
', WPC 5716/2008                                             Page 4 of 21', 
',            Provided that where in a scheme of amalgamation
          or demerger, the amalgamating or the demerged
          company sells or otherwise transfers the business
          to the amalgamated or the resulting company
          (being an Indian Company), the provisions of this
          sub-section--
',           (i) shall not apply in the case of the amalgamating
          or the demerged company; and
',           (ii) shall, as far as may be, apply to the
          amalgamated or the resulting company as they
          would have applied to the amalgamating or the
          demerged company if the latter had not transferred
          the business or interest in the business."
', 
', 6.    The contention of the petitioner is that by mistake, due to

inadvertent oversight and error on the part of the Ministry of Petroleum

and Natural Gas, the petitioner has been denied benefit under ', Section 42', 

of the Act. On account of their mistake, ', Section 42',  was not incorporated

and mentioned in the two PSCs and the contracts were not tabled/laid

before the Parliament.         It is submitted that the petitioner is not

responsible for the said lapse and, therefore, should not be punished and

penalized by being denied benefit under the said Section. The aforesaid

contention      of   the   petitioner   is   pressed   on    the    following

averments/allegations:-
', 
', (a)   Terms and conditions of the Model Production Share Contract

(MPSC, for short), were a part of 1992 NIT. The terms and conditions

of MPSC served as a basis for bid evaluation process. ', Article 16',  of

MPSC dealt with taxes, royalties, rental etc and ', Article 16.2',  provided for

the benefits under ', Section 42',  of the Act. Thus, the MPSC was a part of
', WPC 5716/2008                                               Page 5 of 21', 
 notice of 1992 NIT and was a part of the contracts in questions i.e. the

two PSCs.
', 
', (b)   On 22nd June, 1992, Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, had

sought opinion of the Ministry of Law, Justice and Company Affairs,

whether benefit under ', Section 42',  could be availed of and granted under

contracts involving public-private participation.     Ministry of Law,

Justice and Company Affairs, vide their written opinion dated 21st July,

1992, affirmed and stated that the language of ', Section 42',  was pari

materia with the language of ', Section 293A',  and that vide the PSCs,

which involved participation of the Government in the form of share in

production, concessions as to tax could be granted under ', Sections 293A', 

and ', 42',  of the Act.
', 
', (c)   Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas had written the letter dated

23rd February, 1998, for submission of Hindi translations of the contracts

in view of the requirement that English and Hindi versions of the PSCs

must be placed before the Parliament. In this letter, it was specifically

stated that in order to give effect to provisions in the contract as per

', Section 42',  of the Act, 50 copies each, of both Hindi and English

versions, of the PSCs were required. The case of the petitioner assessee

is that the necessary translation was made and the documents as required

were furnished.
', 
', 
', WPC 5716/2008                                           Page 6 of 21', 
',  (d)   Reconciliation of financial statements between petitioner and the

Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas shows that Government of

India\u201fs "petroleum profit" has been calculated with the benefit under

', Section 42',  of the Act. The Comptroller of Audits & Accounts has also

verified and accepted the said computation.
', 
', (e)   Benefit under ', Section 42',  of the Act has been granted to 216 PSCs

of various oil fields before initiation of New Exploration Licence Policy

(NELP) w.e.f. 1st January, 1999. Reference to benefit under the said

Section was inadvertently missed out in 13 PSCs, which relate to six

different parties including the petitioner and M/s NIKO Resources

Limited, who have also been denied benefit under ', Section 42',  of the Act.

', (f)   Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, in office memorandum

dated 17th June, 2005, had stated and accepted the position that it was

inequitable and unfair not to grant benefit under ', Section 42',  to the 13

PSCs in question. The Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas, in their

letter dated 11th April, 2007, had again justified the grant of benefit

under ', Section 42',  of the Act to the petitioner and the fact that the

Assessing Officer/authorities had questioned the claim/deduction raising

the doubt. Petroleum operations were a high risk business and it would

not be fair if benefits under ', Section 42',  were not given to the 13 PSCs. It

was further stated that due to an oversight, the said PSCs did not contain

a specific provision for allowance and deduction under Section 42
', WPC 5716/2008                                            Page 7 of 21', 
 though this condition or benefit was mentioned in two other contracts,

details of which were mentioned. The Ministry of Finance was requested

to issue necessary clarification.
', 
', (g)   Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas in their letter dated 28 th

April, 2008, had again reiterated that non-failure to refer to ', Section 42',  in

the 13 PSCs was an oversight in isolated cases, as in all other PSCs

signed till then under pre-NELP, included stipulation for benefit under

', Section 42',  of the Act. It was further stated that in the case of 7 PSCs, 2

operated by the petitioner and 5 operated by NIKO Resources Ltd.

located in the State of Gujarat, the Assessing Officer/tax authorities had

disallowed the claim/benefit under ', Section 42',  of the Act and levied tax.

Ministry    of    Finance    was    requested    to   concur     with    the

suggestion/recommendation of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural

Gas with regard to applicability of the benefit under ', Section 42',  to these

13 PSCs.
', 
', (h)   The requirement under ', Section 42',  of the Act is that the contract

should be laid before the Parliament, as a condition subsequent and is

not a prior condition and, therefore, even now the PSCs can be placed

before the Parliament. Reliance was placed on ', Atlas Cycle Industries

Limited vs. State of Haryana', , (1979) 2 SCC 196, wherein it has been

held as under:-
', 
', 
', WPC 5716/2008                                             Page 8 of 21', 
',            22. Now at p. 317 of the aforesaid Edition of Craies on
          Statute Law, the questions whether the direction to lay
          the rules before Parliament is mandatory or merely
          directory and whether laying is a condition precedent to
          their operation or may be neglected without prejudice to
          the effect of the rules are answered by saying that "each
          case must depend on its own circumstances or the
          wording of the statute under which the rules are made".
          In the instant case, it would be noticed that sub- section
          (6) of ', Section 3',  of the Act merely provides that every
          order made under ', Section 3',  by the Central Government
          or by any officer or authority of the Central Government
          shall be laid before both Houses of Parliament, as soon
          as may be, after it is made. It does not provide that it
          shall be subject to the negative or the affirmative
          resolution by either House of Parliament. It also does
          not provide that it shall be open to the Parliament to
          approve or disapprove the order made under ', Section 3', 
          of the Act. It does not even say that it shall be subject to
          any modification which either House of Parliament may
          in its wisdom think it necessary to provide. It does not
          even specify the period for which the order is to be laid
          before both Houses of Parliament nor does it provide
          any penalty for non-observance of or non-compliance
          with the direction as to the laying of the order before
          both Houses of Parliament. It would also be noticed that
          the requirement as to the laying of the order before both
          Houses of Parliament is not a condition precedent but
          subsequent to the making of the order. In other words,
          there is no prohibition to the making of the orders
          without the approval of both Houses of Parliament. In
          these circumstances, we are clearly of the view that the
          requirement as to laying contained in sub-section (6) of
          ', Section 3',  of the Act falls within the first category i.e.
          "simple laying" and is directory not mandatory. We are
          fortified in this view by a catena of decisions, both
          English       and     Indian.    In Bailey v. Williamson [
          1873LRVIII QB 118] where by Section 9 of the Parks
          Regulations Act, 1872 passed on June 27, 1872 "to
          protect the royal parks from injury, and to protect the
          public in the enjoyment of those royal parks and other
          royal possessions for the purpose of innocent recreation
          and exercise" it was provided that any rules made in
', WPC 5716/2008                                             Page 9 of 21', 
           pursuance of the first schedule to the Act shall be
          forthwith laid before both Houses of Parliament, if
          Parliament be sitting, or if not, then within three weeks
          after the beginning of the then next ensuing session of
          Parliament; and if any such rules shall be disapproved
          by either House of Parliament within one month of the
          laying, such rules, or such parts thereof as shall be
          disapproved shall not be enforced and rules for Hyde
          Park were made and published on September 30, 1872
          when Parliament was not sitting and in November 18,
          1872, the appellant was convicted under ', Section 4',  of the
          Act for that he did unlawfully act in contravention of
          Regulation 8 contained in the first Schedule annexed
          thereto by delivering a public address not in accordance
          with the rules of the said Park but contrary to the
          Statute, and it was inter alia contended on his behalf
          that in the absence of distinct words in the statute
          stating that the rules would be operative in the interval
          from the time they were made to the time when
          Parliament should meet next or if Parliament was sitting
          then during the month during which Parliament had an
          opportunity of expressing its opinion upon them, no rule
          made as supplementing the schedule could be operative
          so as to render a person liable to be convicted for
          infraction thereof unless the same had been laid before
          the Parliament, it was held overruling the contention
          that the rules became effective from the time they were
          made and it could not be the intention of the Legislature
          that the laying of the rules before Parliament should be
          made a condition precedent to their acquiring validity
          and that they should not take effect until they are laid
          before and approved by Parliament. If the Legislature
          had intended the same thing as in ', Section 4', , that the
          rules should not take effect until they had the sanction of
          the Parliament, it would have expressly said so by
          employing negative language.
', 
', 7.    Separate counter affidavits/affidavits have been filed by the

Ministry of Finance and by the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas.

In the counter affidavit/ affidavit filed by the Ministry of Finance, they

', WPC 5716/2008                                            Page 10 of 21', 
 have raised preliminary objections regarding territorial jurisdiction, as

well as alternative remedy as the assessment order is appealable.         The

territorial jurisdiction has been challenged on the ground that the

assessment order, in case of the petitioner, was passed in Ahmedabad in

the State of Gujarat and this writ petition has been filed in the Delhi

High Court. We may at the outset note that the Additional Solicitor

General did not press the said objections and rightly, in our opinion.

The petitioner is not challenging/questioning the assessment order,

which is already a subject matter of the appellate proceedings.           The

issue in present writ petition is whether the failure to incorporate a

clause for grant of benefit u/s 42 of the Act was a result of an error or

oversight or the grant of the said benefit was never intended and agreed.

This question cannot be decided by the Assessing Officer or by the

authorities under the Act or in the appellate proceedings pursuant to the

assessment order. The two PSCs in question were executed and signed

in Delhi by the respondent No. 1 i.e. Ministry of Petroleum and Natural

Gas and, therefore, this court has jurisdiction to examine the contention

as the cause of action or subject/issue raised in the writ petition has

arisen or arises in Delhi. Even if a part of the cause of action arises

within the jurisdiction of this Court, the writ petition is maintainable and

can be entertained by this Court. The question of forum convenience, in

the present case, does not arise, as the issue raised, is limited and
', WPC 5716/2008                                             Page 11 of 21', 
 substantially arises in Delhi, as the PSCs were executed in Delhi.

Further the two Ministries, the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of

Petroleum & Natural Gas, have been made parties and their files/relevant

records are in Delhi.
', 
', 8.    Similarly, preliminary objection that the writ petition should not

be entertained, as it relates to a contractual dispute, has to be rejected.

The dispute or the cause of action raised pertains to what was allegedly

agreed and accepted between the petitioner and the Ministry of

Petroleum and Natural Gas.        The dispute does not pertain to the

interpretation of the two PSCs. The writ courts have jurisdiction to

entertain contractual issues when justified and necessary, as per the ratio

expounded and explained by the Supreme Court in Kumari Shrilekha

Vidyarthi and Ors. Vs. State of U.P. and Ors., (1991) 1 SCC 212 and

ABL International Limited & Anr. Vs. Export Credit Guarantee

Corporation of India & Ors., (2004) 3 SCC 553. We note that the writ

petition has remained pending before this Court since August, 2008 and

it may not be proper and appropriate to dismiss the same and ask the

petitioner to file a Civil Suit at this stage. The dispute, though factual,

can be decided on the facts and material on record and on the basis of

official records.
', 
', 9.    This brings us to the core or the main issue: Whether benefit under

', Section 42',  of the Act was envisaged in the 1992 NIT and in the PSCs,
', WPC 5716/2008                                            Page 12 of 21', 
 but due oversight or mistake, the same was not included and mentioned

in the written contract, and if so, the effect thereof?   If the question is

decided in favour of the petitioner, the second aspect is whether a

direction can be issued for grant of benefit under ', Section 42',  of the Act to

the petitioner, with a further direction that the contract should be laid

before the Parliament after incorporating the said clause?

', 10.   The petitioner, in the writ petition, has stated that the 1992 NIT

included and referred to the MPSC. This is not correct. The 1992 NIT

did not refer to the MPSC and did not stipulate that MPSC shall form

part of the tender documents. In 1992 NIT, there was no reference to

MPSC or that the terms and conditions of the MPSC shall be included

in, or be a part of, the PSCs. We do not also find any document or

clause in the bid given by the petitioner under the 1992 NIT to the effect

that the MPSC or clause 16.2 of the same would be applicable and

should a part of the PSCs. The tender given by the petitioner did not

specifically stipulate or include any clause with regard to benefit under

', Section 42',  of the Act.
', 
', 11.   Written PSCs were signed and executed between the petitioner

and the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas in the name of the

President on 20.2.1995. ', Article 15',  of the said two PSCs had specific

stipulations and clauses under the head "Taxes, Royalties, Rentals,

Customs duties, etc." In clause 15.1, it was stated as under:-
', WPC 5716/2008                                             Page 13 of 21', 
',            "15.1 All the Companies and operations under this
          Contract shall be subject to all fiscal legislation in
          India except where, pursuant to any authority granted
          under any applicable law, they are exempted wholly
          or partly from the application of the provisions of a
          particular law or as otherwise provided herein."
', 
', Clauses 15.3 and 15.4 read as under:-
', 
',           "15.3            If any change in or to any Indian Law,
          rule or regulation by any authority dealing with
          income tax or other corporate tax, export/import tax,
          custom duty or tax imposed on Petroleum or
          dependent upon the value of Petroleum results in a
          material change to the economic benefits accruing to
          the parties after the Effective Date of the Contract,
          the parties to this contract shall consult promptly to
          make necessary revisions and adjustment to the
          contract in order to maintain such expected economic
          benefits to the Parties."
', 
',           15.4      (a) No custom duties or other import duties
          are applicable on equipment and materials imported
          solely for use in Petroleum Operations in the
          Contract Area.
',               (b) The Contractor shall not be liable for payment
          of sales tax on sale of Crude oil to the Government/
          its nominee, which shall be payable by the buyer."
', 
', There is no reference to ', Section 42',  of the Act.
', 
', 13.   There is no letter or correspondence written by the petitioner from

1995 onwards stipulating that, by mistake or due to oversight, ', Section 42', 

benefit was not mentioned in the written PSCs. Letter dated 23rd

February, 1998, written by the Desk Officer, Ministry of Petroleum and

Natural Gas refers to the ', Section 42',  and the requirement to table the

contract in both Houses of Parliament and therefore, 50 copies of Hindi

', WPC 5716/2008                                           Page 14 of 21', 
 and English version were required.         However, this letter can be

explained as having been written in routine as in several PSCs benefit

under ', Section 42',  was granted and thus contracts were required to be

placed before the Parliament. This letter by itself or even with other

letters, etc. does not justify the claim of the petitioner. Learned counsel

for the petitioner is justified in relying upon the three letters written by

Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas to the Ministry of Finance being

letters dated 17th June, 2005, 11th April, 2007 and 28th April, 2008.

However, these letters are internal inter- ministerial correspondence and

were written, as it is apparent, on the request of the petitioner or NIKO

Resources Limited.     These are not contemporaneous letters written at

the time when the PSCs were signed.          These letters use the word

\u201eoversight\u201f, but the question is whether or not there was an oversight at

the time of execution and signing of the PSCs in 1992-1995.               The

question is whether or not, at that stage, the parties had envisaged and

were ad idem that the petitioner would be entitled to benefit under

', Section 42',  under the PSCs.     The categorical and emphatic stand taken

by the respondent, Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, in the counter

affidavit, is that no such benefit was envisaged, considered or granted at

the time when the PSCs were negotiated and awarded. Their stand is as

under:-
', 
', 
', WPC 5716/2008                                             Page 15 of 21', 
',              "4.       That the contents of Para 4 are matter of
            record. However, it is submitted that Notice
            Inviting Offer (referred as NIT in the Petition)
            issued by the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural
            Gas, in 1992, did not contain any Model
            Production Sharing Contract (MPSC). The NIT
            was issued for inviting bids for offering of small
            size discovered fields. The MPSC places at
            Annexure P-1 in the petition is for the exploratory
            blocks offered during the same period and not for
            the discovered fields as that of the petitioner. It is
            also submitted that if the position taken by the
            petitioner is accepted as correct that the MPSC
            used for purposes of bid evaluation and execution
            of contract included ', Article 16',  and ', Section 42', , the
            Petitioner, at the time of negotiating the PSC,
            should have prevailed upon the Government for
            including the relevant Section in the executed
            contract, which was not done by the petitioner. It
            is therefore submitted that the petitioner cannot
            put the onus on the respondent for not including
            the relevant section of ', Income Tax Act',  in the PSC.
            It is pertinent to state that the signed PSC did not
            specifically provide for applicability of ', Section 42', 
            of the Income Tax Act.

',             9.     That it is submitted that as against the 1992
            NIT, only 13 PSCs for small sized fields were
            signed, out of which the two PSCs signed with
            Petitioner are part of these PSCs. The other PSCs
            mentioned by the petitioner were signed under
            different NITs.

',             11. That the referred position was observed
            from the scrutiny of records by Ministry of
            Petroleum & Natural Gas, after another
            contractor of similarly placed Hazira PSC i.e. M/s
            NIKO Resources brought to the notice of this
            ministry in May 2005 that the revenue authorities
', WPC 5716/2008                                            Page 16 of 21', 
              had started disallowing the benefit of ', Section 42',  of
             the Income Tax Act, 1961 to the said PSC. It may
             be stated here that no contractor out of these 13
             small size fields as referred in Para 9 above,
             including the Petitioner, made any representation
             to the respondent ministry earlier about
             incorporating the clause pertaining to ', Section 42', 
             of Income Tax Act in respective PSC. It is also
             submitted that as already stated in Para 4, if the
             position taken by Petitioner is taken to be correct
             that the MPSC used for purposes of bid evaluation
             & execution of contract included ', Article 16',  and
             ', Section 42', , the Petitioner, at the time of
             negotiating the PSC, should have prevailed upon
             the respondent for incorporating the relevant
             Section in the executed contract, which was not
             done by the Petitioner. In this view of the matter it
             is stated that the Petitioner cannot put the onus on
             the respondents for not including the relevant
             section of ', Income Tax Act',  in the PSC."
', 
', 14.   In order to verify and examine the correct factual position, we had

asked the respondent Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas to produce

the original files relating to preparation and finalization of tender

documents. They were produced before us on 21 st February, 2012. We

examined the original records and found that under the terms and

conditions, as well as in the notes, no benefit under ', Section 42',  of the Act

was envisaged or was required to be granted. We also recorded the

statement of the learned Additional Solicitor General that the three

letters mentioned above were factually incorrect and, therefore, no legal

right on the basis of the letters accrues/arises. Thus, no statement or




', WPC 5716/2008                                            Page 17 of 21', 
 promise, that advantage under ', Section 42',  would be available to the

successful bidder, was promised or made.
', 
', 15.   On the question of discrimination between 13 PSCs who are not

being given benefit under ', Section 42',  of the Act and other PSCs where

benefit has been given, the respondents have stated that the 13 PSCs

were in respect of small oil fields which had already been discovered

and, therefore, the risk factor was less. The other PSCs were in respect

of undiscovered oil fields, and therefore, the respondents had agreed and

accepted that the benefit under ', Section 42',  should be granted. In view of

the explanation given by the respondents, it cannot be said that the

respondent Ministry of Petroleum or Natural Gas, in the present case,

had deliberately withdrawn the benefit, which was initially envisaged

but due to an oversight was not recorded or mentioned in the written

contract. The respondents have stated that the benefit under ', Section 42', 

was granted in respect of undiscovered oil fields and not in respect of

discovered small oil fields.
', 
', 16.   The petitioner in their affidavit dated 3rd August, 2009, have tried

to controvert the said statement/ averments and stated that in 1994-95,

PSCs were signed for Rawa Oil Field and Panna Mukta oil fields. The

respondents have contested and pointed out that these fields were not

small scale discovered fields. The petitioner has stated that in 2000,

Assam Company Limited was granted benefit of ', Section 42',  in respect of
', WPC 5716/2008                                           Page 18 of 21', 
 Amguri oil field, which was a discovered field. However, in the present

case we are concerned with the year 1993-94 and not with the year 2000

and in 1999 NELP was adopted. We may note here that the petitioner

along with the said affidavit has filed on record an extract from their

tender/bid. In the tender/bid, the petitioner had stated as under: -

',              "In the absence of formal terms & conditions, the
             following     clarifications/qualifications   are
             necessary based on a reading of the "Model
             Contract" :-
', 
',              1)     The model covers all aspects of petroleum
                    operations, including exploration, discovery
                    and development of oilfields, and it will have
                    to be radically pruned to suit the present
                    purpose, viz. development of a discovered
                    oilfield.
', 
',              2)     The various provisions of the model are so
                    interlinked that it will be difficult to delink
                    exploration/discovery from development. In
                    the event Government/ONGC require us to
                    adopt a contract as per the model, deletions
                    and additions have to be made by mutual
                    agreement to cover/address only the
                    development acitivities.

',                                     xxxxxxxxxxxxx

',              l)     ', Article 16',  requires contractor to be liable
             for payment to Government Central & State and
             local bodies of taxes, royalties, cess etc.    We
             assume that in the event of any change in laws and
             regulations, either through amendment or
             interpretation, resulting in additional cost
             implications which the Contractor could not have
             foreseen or allowed for, then all such additional
             costs shall be reimbursed to Contractor, either by

', WPC 5716/2008                                             Page 19 of 21', 
              direct payment from Government or through
             suitable amendment of contract terms."
', 
', 16.   The petitioner was, therefore, aware of clause 16.2 of MPSC,

which specifically makes reference to benefit under ', Section 42',  of the

Act, but did not advert to and refer to the same in their tender bid. They

did not ask for the said benefit.
', 
', 17.   In these circumstances, it is not possible to accept the contention

of the petitioner that benefit under ', Section 42',  of the Act was

inadvertently missed out, or due to an oversight, not included in the

written contract.   In these circumstances, we need not examine the

second question/issue referred to above.
', 
', 18.   We must, however, express our displeasure and anguish over the

averments made in the additional affidavit dated 23rd March, 2012, filed

by the respondent No. 1. It was stated in the additional affidavit that

"Petroleum profit" is shared between the Government of India and the

petitioner at the rates agreed under ', Article 14.2.1',  and it does not include

income tax as a contract cost. This is not fully factually correct as the

petitioner has filed before us copy of the reconciliation and financial

statement for the year 2006-07, with and without benefit under ', Section

42',  and it is pointed out that "petroleum profit" has been calculated with

reference to benefit under ', Section 42', . Our attention is rightly drawn by

the petitioner to the letter dated 11th November, 2009, written by the

', WPC 5716/2008                                            Page 20 of 21', 
 Ministry of Finance, Department of Revenue. In paragraph (I), of the

said communication, it is stated that the government\u201fs share of

"petroleum profit" may be impacted due to changes in the investment

multiple/post tax rate of return but the extent of impact can not be

predicted reliably. Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas should have

been careful while filing and making the said averment. Even if the

factual position was uncomfortable, they should have admitted and

accepted the true facts and should not have been ambivalent.        We do

not, however, proceed on this aspect, as the learned senior counsel for

the petitioner on instructions had stated that they do not want the

Government of India to return or repay the "excess" "petroleum profit"

paid to them.
', 
', 19.   In view of the aforesaid reasoning, we do not find any merit in the

present writ petition and the same is dismissed. In the facts of the case,

there will be no orders as to costs.

HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE R.V. EASWAR

SANJIV KHANNA, J.
", 
',       Joshi Technologies International Inc., a company incorporated in

the United States of America seeks mandamus that they are entitled to

benefit under ', Section 42',  of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (Act, for short) in

respect of the two Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs, in short) both

dated 20th February, 1995 for Oil Fields in Dholka and Wavell, Gujarat.

', 2.    The factual background in brief is that the petitioner along with

Larsen & Toubro Ltd., (who subsequently assigned and transferred their

rights in favour of the petitioner), were successful bidders in the Notice

Inviting Tender, dated 31st December, 1992 ("1992 NIT").               The

"petroleum profit" was/is to be shared as per the terms of the PSC
', WPC 5716/2008                                           Page 1 of 21', 
 between the Government of India, Ministry of Petroleum and Natural

Gas and the petitioner.   The two PSCs have duration of 18 years from

their effective date and have extension provisions.

', 3.    The petitioner in the returns for the Assessment Years 2001-02,

2003-04 and 2004-05, claimed and was allowed deductions under

', Section 42',  of the Act. However, in respect of the assessment year 2005-

06, the Assessing Officer denied benefit under ', Section 42',  vide order

dated 31st December, 2007. Several other additions were made. This

had resulted in an additional demand of Rs.1,24,45,509/-. The petitioner

has filed an appeal against the assessment order before the appellate

authority. It appears that the appeal is pending.
', 
', 4.    The Assessing Officer has also issued notices for re-assessment in

respect of Assessment years 2001-02, 2002-03, 2003-04 and 2004-05, on

the ground that the petitioner was wrongly given benefit of deduction

under ', Section 42',  of the Act in the said years.
', 
', 5.    ', Section 42',  of the Act reads as under:-
', 
',           "42. Special provision for deductions in the case
          of business for prospecting, etc., for mineral oil.--
          [1]For the purpose of computing the profits or
          gains of any business consisting of the prospecting
          for or extraction or production of mineral oils in
          relation to which the Central Government has
          entered into an agreement with any person for the
          association or participation of the Central
          Government or any person authorised by it in such
          business (which agreement has been laid on the
          table of each House of Parliament), there shall be
', WPC 5716/2008                                           Page 2 of 21', 
           made in lieu of, or in addition to, the allowances
          admissible under this Act, such allowances as are
          specified in the agreement in relation--
', 
',           (a) to expenditure by way of infructuous or
          abortive exploration expenses in respect of any
          area surrendered prior to the beginning of
          commercial production by the assessee;
', 
',           (b) after the beginning of commercial production,
          to expenditure incurred by the assessee, whether
          before or after such commercial production, in
          respect of drilling or exploration activities or
          services or in respect of physical assets used in that
          connection, except assets on which allowance for
          depreciation is admissible under ', Section 32', :
', 
',           Provided that in relation to any agreement entered
          into after the 31st day of March, 1981, this clause
          shall have effect subject to the modification that the
          words and figures "except assets on which
          allowance for depreciation is admissible under
          ', Section 32', " had been omitted; and

',           (c) to the depletion of mineral oil in the mining
          area in respect of the assessment year relevant to
          the previous year in which commercial production
          is begun and for such succeeding year or years as
          may be specified in the agreement, and such
          allowances shall be computed and made in the
          manner specified in the agreement, the other
          provisions of this Act being deemed for this
          purpose to have been modified to the extent
          necessary to give effect to the terms of the
          agreement.
',           Explanation.--For the purposes of this section,
          "mineral oil" includes petroleum and natural gas.
          [(2) Where the business of the assessee consisting
          of the prospecting for or extraction or production
          of petroleum and natural gas is transferred wholly
          or partly or any interest in such business is
          transferred in accordance with the agreement
          referred to in sub-section (1), subject to the
', WPC 5716/2008                                             Page 3 of 21', 
           provisions of the said agreement and where the
          proceeds of the transfer (so far as they consist of
          capital sums)--
', 
',           (a) are less than the expenditure incurred
          remaining unallowed, a deduction equal to such
          expenditure remaining unallowed, as reduced by
          the proceeds of transfer, shall be allowed in respect
          of the previous year in which such business or
          interest, as the case may be, is transferred;
', 
',           (b) exceed the amount of the expenditure incurred
          remaining unallowed, so much of the excess as
          does not exceed the difference between the
          expenditure incurred in connection with the
          business or to obtain interest therein and the
          amount of such expenditure remaining unallowed,
          shall be chargeable to income tax as profits and
          gains of the business in the previous year in which
          the business or interest therein, whether wholly or
          partly, had been transferred:
', 
',           Provided that in a case where the provisions of this
          clause do not apply, the deduction to be allowed
          for expenditure incurred remaining unallowed
          shall be arrived at by subtracting the proceeds of
          transfer (so far as they consist of capital sums)
          from the expenditure remaining unallowed.
', 
',           Explanation.--Where the business or interest in
          such business is transferred in a previous year in
          which such business carried on by the assessee is
          no longer in existence, the provisions of this clause
          shall apply as if the business is in existence in that
          previous year;
', 
',           (c) are not less than the amount of the expenditure
          incurred remaining unallowed, no deduction for
          such expenditure shall be allowed in respect of the
          previous year in which the business or interest in
          such business is transferred or in respect of any
          subsequent year or years:
', 
', WPC 5716/2008                                             Page 4 of 21', 
',            Provided that where in a scheme of amalgamation
          or demerger, the amalgamating or the demerged
          company sells or otherwise transfers the business
          to the amalgamated or the resulting company
          (being an Indian Company), the provisions of this
          sub-section--
',           (i) shall not apply in the case of the amalgamating
          or the demerged company; and
',           (ii) shall, as far as may be, apply to the
          amalgamated or the resulting company as they
          would have applied to the amalgamating or the
          demerged company if the latter had not transferred
          the business or interest in the business."
', 
', 6.    The contention of the petitioner is that by mistake, due to

inadvertent oversight and error on the part of the Ministry of Petroleum

and Natural Gas, the petitioner has been denied benefit under ', Section 42', 

of the Act. On account of their mistake, ', Section 42',  was not incorporated

and mentioned in the two PSCs and the contracts were not tabled/laid

before the Parliament.         It is submitted that the petitioner is not

responsible for the said lapse and, therefore, should not be punished and

penalized by being denied benefit under the said Section. The aforesaid

contention      of   the   petitioner   is   pressed   on    the    following

averments/allegations:-
', 
', (a)   Terms and conditions of the Model Production Share Contract

(MPSC, for short), were a part of 1992 NIT. The terms and conditions

of MPSC served as a basis for bid evaluation process. ', Article 16',  of

MPSC dealt with taxes, royalties, rental etc and ', Article 16.2',  provided for

the benefits under ', Section 42',  of the Act. Thus, the MPSC was a part of
', WPC 5716/2008                                               Page 5 of 21', 
 notice of 1992 NIT and was a part of the contracts in questions i.e. the

two PSCs.
', 
', (b)   On 22nd June, 1992, Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, had

sought opinion of the Ministry of Law, Justice and Company Affairs,

whether benefit under ', Section 42',  could be availed of and granted under

contracts involving public-private participation.     Ministry of Law,

Justice and Company Affairs, vide their written opinion dated 21st July,

1992, affirmed and stated that the language of ', Section 42',  was pari

materia with the language of ', Section 293A',  and that vide the PSCs,

which involved participation of the Government in the form of share in

production, concessions as to tax could be granted under ', Sections 293A', 

and ', 42',  of the Act.
', 
', (c)   Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas had written the letter dated

23rd February, 1998, for submission of Hindi translations of the contracts

in view of the requirement that English and Hindi versions of the PSCs

must be placed before the Parliament. In this letter, it was specifically

stated that in order to give effect to provisions in the contract as per

', Section 42',  of the Act, 50 copies each, of both Hindi and English

versions, of the PSCs were required. The case of the petitioner assessee

is that the necessary translation was made and the documents as required

were furnished.
', 
', 
', WPC 5716/2008                                           Page 6 of 21', 
',  (d)   Reconciliation of financial statements between petitioner and the

Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas shows that Government of

India\u201fs "petroleum profit" has been calculated with the benefit under

', Section 42',  of the Act. The Comptroller of Audits & Accounts has also

verified and accepted the said computation.
', 
', (e)   Benefit under ', Section 42',  of the Act has been granted to 216 PSCs

of various oil fields before initiation of New Exploration Licence Policy

(NELP) w.e.f. 1st January, 1999. Reference to benefit under the said

Section was inadvertently missed out in 13 PSCs, which relate to six

different parties including the petitioner and M/s NIKO Resources

Limited, who have also been denied benefit under ', Section 42',  of the Act.

', (f)   Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, in office memorandum

dated 17th June, 2005, had stated and accepted the position that it was

inequitable and unfair not to grant benefit under ', Section 42',  to the 13

PSCs in question. The Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas, in their

letter dated 11th April, 2007, had again justified the grant of benefit

under ', Section 42',  of the Act to the petitioner and the fact that the

Assessing Officer/authorities had questioned the claim/deduction raising

the doubt. Petroleum operations were a high risk business and it would

not be fair if benefits under ', Section 42',  were not given to the 13 PSCs. It

was further stated that due to an oversight, the said PSCs did not contain

a specific provision for allowance and deduction under Section 42
', WPC 5716/2008                                            Page 7 of 21', 
 though this condition or benefit was mentioned in two other contracts,

details of which were mentioned. The Ministry of Finance was requested

to issue necessary clarification.
', 
', (g)   Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas in their letter dated 28 th

April, 2008, had again reiterated that non-failure to refer to ', Section 42',  in

the 13 PSCs was an oversight in isolated cases, as in all other PSCs

signed till then under pre-NELP, included stipulation for benefit under

', Section 42',  of the Act. It was further stated that in the case of 7 PSCs, 2

operated by the petitioner and 5 operated by NIKO Resources Ltd.

located in the State of Gujarat, the Assessing Officer/tax authorities had

disallowed the claim/benefit under ', Section 42',  of the Act and levied tax.

Ministry    of    Finance    was    requested    to   concur     with    the

suggestion/recommendation of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural

Gas with regard to applicability of the benefit under ', Section 42',  to these

13 PSCs.
', 
', (h)   The requirement under ', Section 42',  of the Act is that the contract

should be laid before the Parliament, as a condition subsequent and is

not a prior condition and, therefore, even now the PSCs can be placed

before the Parliament. Reliance was placed on ', Atlas Cycle Industries

Limited vs. State of Haryana', , (1979) 2 SCC 196, wherein it has been

held as under:-
', 
', 
', WPC 5716/2008                                             Page 8 of 21', 
',            22. Now at p. 317 of the aforesaid Edition of Craies on
          Statute Law, the questions whether the direction to lay
          the rules before Parliament is mandatory or merely
          directory and whether laying is a condition precedent to
          their operation or may be neglected without prejudice to
          the effect of the rules are answered by saying that "each
          case must depend on its own circumstances or the
          wording of the statute under which the rules are made".
          In the instant case, it would be noticed that sub- section
          (6) of ', Section 3',  of the Act merely provides that every
          order made under ', Section 3',  by the Central Government
          or by any officer or authority of the Central Government
          shall be laid before both Houses of Parliament, as soon
          as may be, after it is made. It does not provide that it
          shall be subject to the negative or the affirmative
          resolution by either House of Parliament. It also does
          not provide that it shall be open to the Parliament to
          approve or disapprove the order made under ', Section 3', 
          of the Act. It does not even say that it shall be subject to
          any modification which either House of Parliament may
          in its wisdom think it necessary to provide. It does not
          even specify the period for which the order is to be laid
          before both Houses of Parliament nor does it provide
          any penalty for non-observance of or non-compliance
          with the direction as to the laying of the order before
          both Houses of Parliament. It would also be noticed that
          the requirement as to the laying of the order before both
          Houses of Parliament is not a condition precedent but
          subsequent to the making of the order. In other words,
          there is no prohibition to the making of the orders
          without the approval of both Houses of Parliament. In
          these circumstances, we are clearly of the view that the
          requirement as to laying contained in sub-section (6) of
          ', Section 3',  of the Act falls within the first category i.e.
          "simple laying" and is directory not mandatory. We are
          fortified in this view by a catena of decisions, both
          English       and     Indian.    In Bailey v. Williamson [
          1873LRVIII QB 118] where by Section 9 of the Parks
          Regulations Act, 1872 passed on June 27, 1872 "to
          protect the royal parks from injury, and to protect the
          public in the enjoyment of those royal parks and other
          royal possessions for the purpose of innocent recreation
          and exercise" it was provided that any rules made in
', WPC 5716/2008                                             Page 9 of 21', 
           pursuance of the first schedule to the Act shall be
          forthwith laid before both Houses of Parliament, if
          Parliament be sitting, or if not, then within three weeks
          after the beginning of the then next ensuing session of
          Parliament; and if any such rules shall be disapproved
          by either House of Parliament within one month of the
          laying, such rules, or such parts thereof as shall be
          disapproved shall not be enforced and rules for Hyde
          Park were made and published on September 30, 1872
          when Parliament was not sitting and in November 18,
          1872, the appellant was convicted under ', Section 4',  of the
          Act for that he did unlawfully act in contravention of
          Regulation 8 contained in the first Schedule annexed
          thereto by delivering a public address not in accordance
          with the rules of the said Park but contrary to the
          Statute, and it was inter alia contended on his behalf
          that in the absence of distinct words in the statute
          stating that the rules would be operative in the interval
          from the time they were made to the time when
          Parliament should meet next or if Parliament was sitting
          then during the month during which Parliament had an
          opportunity of expressing its opinion upon them, no rule
          made as supplementing the schedule could be operative
          so as to render a person liable to be convicted for
          infraction thereof unless the same had been laid before
          the Parliament, it was held overruling the contention
          that the rules became effective from the time they were
          made and it could not be the intention of the Legislature
          that the laying of the rules before Parliament should be
          made a condition precedent to their acquiring validity
          and that they should not take effect until they are laid
          before and approved by Parliament. If the Legislature
          had intended the same thing as in ', Section 4', , that the
          rules should not take effect until they had the sanction of
          the Parliament, it would have expressly said so by
          employing negative language.
', 
', 7.    Separate counter affidavits/affidavits have been filed by the

Ministry of Finance and by the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas.

In the counter affidavit/ affidavit filed by the Ministry of Finance, they

', WPC 5716/2008                                            Page 10 of 21', 
 have raised preliminary objections regarding territorial jurisdiction, as

well as alternative remedy as the assessment order is appealable.         The

territorial jurisdiction has been challenged on the ground that the

assessment order, in case of the petitioner, was passed in Ahmedabad in

the State of Gujarat and this writ petition has been filed in the Delhi

High Court. We may at the outset note that the Additional Solicitor

General did not press the said objections and rightly, in our opinion.

The petitioner is not challenging/questioning the assessment order,

which is already a subject matter of the appellate proceedings.           The

issue in present writ petition is whether the failure to incorporate a

clause for grant of benefit u/s 42 of the Act was a result of an error or

oversight or the grant of the said benefit was never intended and agreed.

This question cannot be decided by the Assessing Officer or by the

authorities under the Act or in the appellate proceedings pursuant to the

assessment order. The two PSCs in question were executed and signed

in Delhi by the respondent No. 1 i.e. Ministry of Petroleum and Natural

Gas and, therefore, this court has jurisdiction to examine the contention

as the cause of action or subject/issue raised in the writ petition has

arisen or arises in Delhi. Even if a part of the cause of action arises

within the jurisdiction of this Court, the writ petition is maintainable and

can be entertained by this Court. The question of forum convenience, in

the present case, does not arise, as the issue raised, is limited and
', WPC 5716/2008                                             Page 11 of 21', 
 substantially arises in Delhi, as the PSCs were executed in Delhi.

Further the two Ministries, the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of

Petroleum & Natural Gas, have been made parties and their files/relevant

records are in Delhi.
', 
', 8.    Similarly, preliminary objection that the writ petition should not

be entertained, as it relates to a contractual dispute, has to be rejected.

The dispute or the cause of action raised pertains to what was allegedly

agreed and accepted between the petitioner and the Ministry of

Petroleum and Natural Gas.        The dispute does not pertain to the

interpretation of the two PSCs. The writ courts have jurisdiction to

entertain contractual issues when justified and necessary, as per the ratio

expounded and explained by the Supreme Court in Kumari Shrilekha

Vidyarthi and Ors. Vs. State of U.P. and Ors., (1991) 1 SCC 212 and

ABL International Limited & Anr. Vs. Export Credit Guarantee

Corporation of India & Ors., (2004) 3 SCC 553. We note that the writ

petition has remained pending before this Court since August, 2008 and

it may not be proper and appropriate to dismiss the same and ask the

petitioner to file a Civil Suit at this stage. The dispute, though factual,

can be decided on the facts and material on record and on the basis of

official records.
', 
', 9.    This brings us to the core or the main issue: Whether benefit under

', Section 42',  of the Act was envisaged in the 1992 NIT and in the PSCs,
', WPC 5716/2008                                            Page 12 of 21', 
 but due oversight or mistake, the same was not included and mentioned

in the written contract, and if so, the effect thereof?   If the question is

decided in favour of the petitioner, the second aspect is whether a

direction can be issued for grant of benefit under ', Section 42',  of the Act to

the petitioner, with a further direction that the contract should be laid

before the Parliament after incorporating the said clause?

', 10.   The petitioner, in the writ petition, has stated that the 1992 NIT

included and referred to the MPSC. This is not correct. The 1992 NIT

did not refer to the MPSC and did not stipulate that MPSC shall form

part of the tender documents. In 1992 NIT, there was no reference to

MPSC or that the terms and conditions of the MPSC shall be included

in, or be a part of, the PSCs. We do not also find any document or

clause in the bid given by the petitioner under the 1992 NIT to the effect

that the MPSC or clause 16.2 of the same would be applicable and

should a part of the PSCs. The tender given by the petitioner did not

specifically stipulate or include any clause with regard to benefit under

', Section 42',  of the Act.
', 
', 11.   Written PSCs were signed and executed between the petitioner

and the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas in the name of the

President on 20.2.1995. ', Article 15',  of the said two PSCs had specific

stipulations and clauses under the head "Taxes, Royalties, Rentals,

Customs duties, etc." In clause 15.1, it was stated as under:-
', WPC 5716/2008                                             Page 13 of 21', 
',            "15.1 All the Companies and operations under this
          Contract shall be subject to all fiscal legislation in
          India except where, pursuant to any authority granted
          under any applicable law, they are exempted wholly
          or partly from the application of the provisions of a
          particular law or as otherwise provided herein."
', 
', Clauses 15.3 and 15.4 read as under:-
', 
',           "15.3            If any change in or to any Indian Law,
          rule or regulation by any authority dealing with
          income tax or other corporate tax, export/import tax,
          custom duty or tax imposed on Petroleum or
          dependent upon the value of Petroleum results in a
          material change to the economic benefits accruing to
          the parties after the Effective Date of the Contract,
          the parties to this contract shall consult promptly to
          make necessary revisions and adjustment to the
          contract in order to maintain such expected economic
          benefits to the Parties."
', 
',           15.4      (a) No custom duties or other import duties
          are applicable on equipment and materials imported
          solely for use in Petroleum Operations in the
          Contract Area.
',               (b) The Contractor shall not be liable for payment
          of sales tax on sale of Crude oil to the Government/
          its nominee, which shall be payable by the buyer."
', 
', There is no reference to ', Section 42',  of the Act.
', 
', 13.   There is no letter or correspondence written by the petitioner from

1995 onwards stipulating that, by mistake or due to oversight, ', Section 42', 

benefit was not mentioned in the written PSCs. Letter dated 23rd

February, 1998, written by the Desk Officer, Ministry of Petroleum and

Natural Gas refers to the ', Section 42',  and the requirement to table the

contract in both Houses of Parliament and therefore, 50 copies of Hindi

', WPC 5716/2008                                           Page 14 of 21', 
 and English version were required.         However, this letter can be

explained as having been written in routine as in several PSCs benefit

under ', Section 42',  was granted and thus contracts were required to be

placed before the Parliament. This letter by itself or even with other

letters, etc. does not justify the claim of the petitioner. Learned counsel

for the petitioner is justified in relying upon the three letters written by

Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas to the Ministry of Finance being

letters dated 17th June, 2005, 11th April, 2007 and 28th April, 2008.

However, these letters are internal inter- ministerial correspondence and

were written, as it is apparent, on the request of the petitioner or NIKO

Resources Limited.     These are not contemporaneous letters written at

the time when the PSCs were signed.          These letters use the word

\u201eoversight\u201f, but the question is whether or not there was an oversight at

the time of execution and signing of the PSCs in 1992-1995.               The

question is whether or not, at that stage, the parties had envisaged and

were ad idem that the petitioner would be entitled to benefit under

', Section 42',  under the PSCs.     The categorical and emphatic stand taken

by the respondent, Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, in the counter

affidavit, is that no such benefit was envisaged, considered or granted at

the time when the PSCs were negotiated and awarded. Their stand is as

under:-

',              "4.       That the contents of Para 4 are matter of
            record. However, it is submitted that Notice
            Inviting Offer (referred as NIT in the Petition)
            issued by the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural
            Gas, in 1992, did not contain any Model
            Production Sharing Contract (MPSC). The NIT
            was issued for inviting bids for offering of small
            size discovered fields. The MPSC places at
            Annexure P-1 in the petition is for the exploratory
            blocks offered during the same period and not for
            the discovered fields as that of the petitioner. It is
            also submitted that if the position taken by the
            petitioner is accepted as correct that the MPSC
            used for purposes of bid evaluation and execution
            of contract included ', Article 16',  and ', Section 42', , the
            Petitioner, at the time of negotiating the PSC,
            should have prevailed upon the Government for
            including the relevant Section in the executed
            contract, which was not done by the petitioner. It
            is therefore submitted that the petitioner cannot
            put the onus on the respondent for not including
            the relevant section of ', Income Tax Act',  in the PSC.
            It is pertinent to state that the signed PSC did not
            specifically provide for applicability of ', Section 42', 
            of the Income Tax Act.

            NIT, only 13 PSCs for small sized fields were
            signed, out of which the two PSCs signed with
            Petitioner are part of these PSCs. The other PSCs
            mentioned by the petitioner were signed under
            different NITs.

',             11. That the referred position was observed
            from the scrutiny of records by Ministry of
            Petroleum & Natural Gas, after another
            contractor of similarly placed Hazira PSC i.e. M/s
            NIKO Resources brought to the notice of this
            ministry in May 2005 that the revenue authorities
', WPC 5716/2008                                            Page 16 of 21', 
              had started disallowing the benefit of ', Section 42',  of
             the Income Tax Act, 1961 to the said PSC. It may
             be stated here that no contractor out of these 13
             small size fields as referred in Para 9 above,
             including the Petitioner, made any representation
             to the respondent ministry earlier about
             incorporating the clause pertaining to ', Section 42', 
             of Income Tax Act in respective PSC. It is also
             submitted that as already stated in Para 4, if the
             position taken by Petitioner is taken to be correct
             that the MPSC used for purposes of bid evaluation
             & execution of contract included ', Article 16',  and
             ', Section 42', , the Petitioner, at the time of
             negotiating the PSC, should have prevailed upon
             the respondent for incorporating the relevant
             Section in the executed contract, which was not
             done by the Petitioner. In this view of the matter it
             is stated that the Petitioner cannot put the onus on
             the respondents for not including the relevant
             section of ', Income Tax Act',  in the PSC."
', 
', 14.   In order to verify and examine the correct factual position, we had

asked the respondent Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas to produce

the original files relating to preparation and finalization of tender

documents. They were produced before us on 21 st February, 2012. We

examined the original records and found that under the terms and

conditions, as well as in the notes, no benefit under ', Section 42',  of the Act

was envisaged or was required to be granted. We also recorded the

statement of the learned Additional Solicitor General that the three

letters mentioned above were factually incorrect and, therefore, no legal

right on the basis of the letters accrues/arises. Thus, no statement or




', WPC 5716/2008                                            Page 17 of 21', 
 promise, that advantage under ', Section 42',  would be available to the

successful bidder, was promised or made.
', 
', 15.   On the question of discrimination between 13 PSCs who are not

being given benefit under ', Section 42',  of the Act and other PSCs where

benefit has been given, the respondents have stated that the 13 PSCs

were in respect of small oil fields which had already been discovered

and, therefore, the risk factor was less. The other PSCs were in respect

of undiscovered oil fields, and therefore, the respondents had agreed and

accepted that the benefit under ', Section 42',  should be granted. In view of

the explanation given by the respondents, it cannot be said that the

respondent Ministry of Petroleum or Natural Gas, in the present case,

had deliberately withdrawn the benefit, which was initially envisaged

but due to an oversight was not recorded or mentioned in the written

contract. The respondents have stated that the benefit under ', Section 42', 

was granted in respect of undiscovered oil fields and not in respect of

discovered small oil fields.
', 
', 16.   The petitioner in their affidavit dated 3rd August, 2009, have tried

to controvert the said statement/ averments and stated that in 1994-95,

PSCs were signed for Rawa Oil Field and Panna Mukta oil fields. The

respondents have contested and pointed out that these fields were not

small scale discovered fields. The petitioner has stated that in 2000,

Assam Company Limited was granted benefit of ', Section 42',  in respect of
', WPC 5716/2008                                           Page 18 of 21', 
 Amguri oil field, which was a discovered field. However, in the present

case we are concerned with the year 1993-94 and not with the year 2000

and in 1999 NELP was adopted. We may note here that the petitioner

along with the said affidavit has filed on record an extract from their

tender/bid. In the tender/bid, the petitioner had stated as under: -

',              "In the absence of formal terms & conditions, the
             following     clarifications/qualifications   are
             necessary based on a reading of the "Model
             Contract" :-
', 
',              1)     The model covers all aspects of petroleum
                    operations, including exploration, discovery
                    and development of oilfields, and it will have
                    to be radically pruned to suit the present
                    purpose, viz. development of a discovered
                    oilfield.
', 
',              2)     The various provisions of the model are so
                    interlinked that it will be difficult to delink
                    exploration/discovery from development. In
                    the event Government/ONGC require us to
                    adopt a contract as per the model, deletions
                    and additions have to be made by mutual
                    agreement to cover/address only the
                    development acitivities.

',              l)     ', Article 16',  requires contractor to be liable
             for payment to Government Central & State and
             local bodies of taxes, royalties, cess etc.    We
             assume that in the event of any change in laws and
             regulations, either through amendment or
             interpretation, resulting in additional cost
             implications which the Contractor could not have
             foreseen or allowed for, then all such additional
             costs shall be reimbursed to Contractor, either by

              direct payment from Government or through
             suitable amendment of contract terms."
', 
', 16.   The petitioner was, therefore, aware of clause 16.2 of MPSC,

which specifically makes reference to benefit under ', Section 42',  of the

Act, but did not advert to and refer to the same in their tender bid. They

did not ask for the said benefit.
', 
', 17.   In these circumstances, it is not possible to accept the contention

of the petitioner that benefit under ', Section 42',  of the Act was

inadvertently missed out, or due to an oversight, not included in the

written contract.   In these circumstances, we need not examine the

second question/issue referred to above.
', 
', 18.   We must, however, express our displeasure and anguish over the

averments made in the additional affidavit dated 23rd March, 2012, filed

by the respondent No. 1. It was stated in the additional affidavit that

"Petroleum profit" is shared between the Government of India and the

petitioner at the rates agreed under ', Article 14.2.1',  and it does not include

income tax as a contract cost. This is not fully factually correct as the

petitioner has filed before us copy of the reconciliation and financial

statement for the year 2006-07, with and without benefit under ', Section

42',  and it is pointed out that "petroleum profit" has been calculated with

reference to benefit under ', Section 42', . Our attention is rightly drawn by

the petitioner to the letter dated 11th November, 2009, written by the

', WPC 5716/2008                                            Page 20 of 21', 
 Ministry of Finance, Department of Revenue. In paragraph (I), of the

said communication, it is stated that the government\u201fs share of

"petroleum profit" may be impacted due to changes in the investment

multiple/post tax rate of return but the extent of impact can not be

predicted reliably. Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas should have

been careful while filing and making the said averment. Even if the

factual position was uncomfortable, they should have admitted and

accepted the true facts and should not have been ambivalent.        We do

not, however, proceed on this aspect, as the learned senior counsel for

the petitioner on instructions had stated that they do not want the

Government of India to return or repay the "excess" "petroleum profit"

paid to them.
', 
', 19.   In view of the aforesaid reasoning, we do not find any merit in the

present writ petition and the same is dismissed. In the facts of the case,

there will be no orders as to costs.
