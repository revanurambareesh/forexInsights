        ', Ending a two-year criminal investigation into charges that it was trying to illegally collect debts from customers who had declared bankruptcy, Sears, Roebuck & Company agreed yesterday to plead guilty to one count of bankruptcy fraud and to pay a fine of $60 million.', u"The fine, which is subject to approval by the Federal District Court, would be the largest ever to be paid in a bankruptcy fraud case, according to the United States Attorney's office in Boston.", The charges concern a policy by Sears Bankruptcy Recovery Management Services Inc., a unit of the retailer, to force credit-card customers who had filed for personal bankruptcy protection to pay Sears their back debts anyway. Many customers felt obligated to sign reaffirmation agreements giving them a schedule of payments to settle their outstanding balances. Sears, which is based in Hoffman Estates, Ill., never filed the reaffirmation agreements with the court, in violation of the law.', u"The fine's severity caused many bankruptcy experts to see an impact beyond Sears. Elizabeth Warren, a Harvard Law School professor, said, ''This is a bombshell in the consumer protection area.'' She added, ''This is a warning'' to other retailers that ''someone is looking out for hard-pressed consumer debtors.''",

', May Department Stores and Montgomery Ward have also been hit with class action lawsuits over their reaffirmation practices.', u"Sears had long acknowledged ''flawed legal judgment'' in pursuing the cases and already paid more than $180 million in restitution to about 188,000 debtors and $40 million in civil fines to 50 state attorneys general. A Sears spokeswoman, Jan Drummond, said, ''This has been the outstanding item and it is a relief to finally have a resolution.''", In the second quarter of 1997, Sears took a pretax charge of $475 million to cover the cost of the fines, settlements and expenses related to the unfiled agreements.', u"As a result, Ms. Drummond said the fine would have ''no effect on Sears's earnings'' this year.",         ', Continue reading the main story',

        ', Ending a two-year criminal investigation into charges that it was trying to illegally collect debts from customers who had declared bankruptcy, Sears, Roebuck & Company agreed yesterday to plead guilty to one count of bankruptcy fraud and to pay a fine of $60 million.', u"The fine, which is subject to approval by the Federal District Court, would be the largest ever to be paid in a bankruptcy fraud case, according to the United States Attorney's office in Boston.", The charges concern a policy by Sears Bankruptcy Recovery Management Services Inc., a unit of the retailer, to force credit-card customers who had filed for personal bankruptcy protection to pay Sears their back debts anyway. Many customers felt obligated to sign reaffirmation agreements giving them a schedule of payments to settle their outstanding balances. Sears, which is based in Hoffman Estates, Ill., never filed the reaffirmation agreements with the court, in violation of the law.', u"The fine's severity caused many bankruptcy experts to see an impact beyond Sears. Elizabeth Warren, a Harvard Law School professor, said, ''This is a bombshell in the consumer protection area.'' She added, ''This is a warning'' to other retailers that ''someone is looking out for hard-pressed consumer debtors.''",

', May Department Stores and Montgomery Ward have also been hit with class action lawsuits over their reaffirmation practices.', u"Sears had long acknowledged ''flawed legal judgment'' in pursuing the cases and already paid more than $180 million in restitution to about 188,000 debtors and $40 million in civil fines to 50 state attorneys general.
