          ', New Delhi, India \u2014 June 7, 2016 \u2014 Alstom Bharat Forge Power Private Ltd. (ABFPPL), the joint venture company between GE and Bharat Forge Ltd., has signed a contract worth $219 million approximately (14950 M INR approx.) with NTPC Limited. The Company will supply two units of 800 MW ultra-supercritical Steam Turbine Generator Islands, on EPC basis, along with related civil work for the Telangana Super Thermal Power Project Phase-1 near Ramagundam, Karimnagar district of Telangana State, India.', 

',  ', 

', The total power demand from the southern region is 34,000 MW. The 800MW Steam Turbine Generator Islands for the power plant will be the first with ultra-supercritical parameters and will help in meeting the ever increasing power demand of southern states in India by adding a much needed 1600 MW to the electricity grid.', 

',  ', 

', Under the scope of the contract, ABFPPL will manufacture and supply two units of 800 MW Steam Turbine Generator Islands along with the associated civil work. The equipment for the project will be manufactured majorly at ABFPL\u2019s state-of-the-art manufacturing facility at Sanand in Gujarat.', 

',  ', 

', Alain Spohr, CEO & Managing Director, ABFPPL said, \u201cWe are pleased to provide our ultra-supercritical technology for NTPC\u2019s prestigious project that will make a significant contribution to power generation in the state of Telangana. We are confident that we will continue to deliver innovative and technologically-robust power production solutions to meet India\u2019s growing energy requirement.\u201d', 

',  ', 

', GE has more than 100 years of steam power experience. GE\u2019s ultra-supercritical technology uses steam at very high temperatures and pressure, resulting in a much higher efficiency than conventional subcritical coal-fired plants. This means that an ultra- supercritical unit burns much less coal, generating less emission per megawatt of power output.         ',

          ', New Delhi, India \u2014 June 7, 2016 \u2014 Alstom Bharat Forge Power Private Ltd. (ABFPPL), the joint venture company between GE and Bharat Forge Ltd., has signed a contract worth $219 million approximately (14950 M INR approx.) with NTPC Limited. The Company will supply two units of 800 MW ultra-supercritical Steam Turbine Generator Islands, on EPC basis, along with related civil work for the Telangana Super Thermal Power Project Phase-1 near Ramagundam, Karimnagar district of Telangana State, India.', 

',  ', 

', The total power demand from the southern region is 34,000 MW. The 800MW Steam Turbine Generator Islands for the power plant will be the first with ultra-supercritical parameters and will help in meeting the ever increasing power demand of southern states in India by adding a much needed 1600 MW to the electricity grid.', 

',  ', 

', Under the scope of the contract, ABFPPL will manufacture and supply two units of 800 MW Steam Turbine Generator Islands along with the associated civil work. The equipment for the project will be manufactured majorly at ABFPL\u2019s state-of-the-art manufacturing facility at Sanand in Gujarat.', 

',  ', 

', Alain Spohr, CEO & Managing Director, ABFPPL said, \u201cWe are pleased to provide our ultra-supercritical technology for NTPC\u2019s prestigious project that will make a significant contribution to power generation in the state of Telangana. We are confident that we will continue to deliver innovative and technologically-robust power production solutions to meet India\u2019s growing energy requirement.\u201d', 

',  ', 

', GE has more than 100 years of steam power experience. GE\u2019s ultra-supercritical technology uses steam at very high temperatures and pressure, resulting in a much higher efficiency than conventional subcritical coal-fired plants. This means that an ultra- supercritical unit burns much less coal, generating less emission per megawatt of power output.         ',
