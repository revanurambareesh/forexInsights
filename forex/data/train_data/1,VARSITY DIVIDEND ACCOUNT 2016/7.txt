We\u2019ll skip a level if we have to because of the ability of the player.', \u201cIt\u2019s something we do, but not something we seek out.\u201d', Senior quarterback Rocky Lombardi is entering his third varsity season, as is junior running back Jevon Mason. Given early opportunities at skill positions, they shined and gained quick experience against Valley\u2019s gauntlet of a schedule.', u"

", DES MOINES REGISTER', u"Hoover's Siffin faces uphill climb replacing playmakers", \u201cWhen you come in as a sophomore, you\u2019ve got to earn your respect and you\u2019re playing with senior receivers, senior linemen,\u201d Lombardi said. \u201cIt makes it a lot easier to step into a leadership role this season. My teammates have all seen me play varsity. I feel like a quarterback should be a leader on and off the field, too.\u201d', Lombardi threw for 2,258 yards and 25 touchdowns last season, while Mason rushed for 1,589 yards and 22 scores. They\u2019re talented players, but the trust Swenson\u2019s staff showed allowed them to develop on the field. Having Nebraska offensive lineman John Raridon pave the way didn\u2019t hurt.', \u201cWorking through the playoffs last year and getting to the UNI-Dome has definitely changed how I view the game,\u201d Lombardi said. \u201cAnd the size and speed of everything has calmed down.\u201d', Raridon was an early example of Valley\u2019s youth movement, getting four years of varsity experience at a position that typically requires the physical maturity of juniors or seniors. Adding years of training to his natural ability allowed the team to feed off that experience and leadership. And the next batch of underclassmen would become even more inclined to listen to a lineman that would eventually be a three-time elite all-state selection.', \u201cJohn had trained at a different level than most kids his age and was just ready to do it,\u201d Swenson said. \u201cBut even with him, we would have preferred to have left him with his age group.', \u201cIt\u2019s never a scientific decision. You have to go with what you feel you\u2019ve seen.\u201d', More preps football coverage ', After hitting refresh, Regina eyes a seventh straight title', u"Can Dowling make another run to state? We break down the Maroons' roster", West High is loaded with D-I talent coming off 4-7 season', Take Five: District splits have greatly changed CIML', Sophomores Beau Lombardi and Tre Fugate are this year\u2019s youngsters being given an opportunity with the Tigers. Lombardi is a quarterback following in his older brother Rocky\u2019s footsteps, for now. Fugate is a versatile athlete that Rivals threw on its \u201cFab 15\u201d out of the Pro Football Hall of Fame Academy\u2019s showcase last month.', Receiver Luke Matney is with Mason among last year\u2019s sophomores who got significant touches.', \u201cI think it\u2019s an advantage to get that experience,\u201d Swenson said. \u201cBut it\u2019s what they do with it that matters.\u201d', Ben Campos is back for his third varsity campaign as well. A middle linebacker and younger brother of Iowa State offensive lineman Jake, Campos says what he gained getting pulled up early to play with Valley\u2019s massive varsity roster was priceless. He\u2019s been the team\u2019s top tackler for the last two years.', \u201cIt was really intimidating,\u201d Campos said. \u201cI got to come up to varsity practice as a freshman, so when I was a sophomore, I wouldn\u2019t say I was used to the speed, but I had seen it before. That was great to have under my belt.\u201d', His senior class includes other major contributors who have played more than the traditional two varsity seasons. Receiver Austin Hinkle had 41 catches for 758 yards and eight touchdowns last season. Kicker Cole Hahn has made 15 field goals and 111 PATs in three previous seasons with the Tigers. Tough runner Austin Koch is in his third year backing up Mason, Sam Rogers is on the offensive line, and Noah Barr is back in the secondary.', Buy Photo',  ', (Photo: Brian Powers/Register file photo)', They all adapted quickly to a tight-knit locker room and tremendously deep lineup.', \u201cThey treated me like any other guy,\u201d Campos. \u201cI was trying to keep afloat and do my job. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been focused on ever since. I know if I do my job, the people next to me are going to do theirs.', \u201cNow it\u2019s my senior year. It might sound cliché, but I\u2019m ready to play my heart out.\u201d', The expectation at Valley Stadium is that the experience of talented young players will get the Tigers back to double-digit wins.', \u201cAt smaller schools, it\u2019s not uncommon at all to have ninth and 10th graders playing, but it\u2019s a numbers game,\u201d Swenson said.', \u201cIt\u2019s not magic. Can they physically compete earlier than their classmates? Even if they can, it doesn\u2019t guarantee anything. They still have to go out and be able to play today.\u201d', Facebook', Twitter', Google+', LinkedIn', 20 Photos: Dowling Catholic vs. Valley 4A semifinals',  ', Fullscreen', Post to Facebook', Posted!', A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

My teammates have all seen me play varsity. I feel like a quarterback should be a leader on and off the field, too.\u201d', Lombardi threw for 2,258 yards and 25 touchdowns last season, while Mason rushed for 1,589 yards and 22 scores. They\u2019re talented players, but the trust Swenson\u2019s staff showed allowed them to develop on the field. Having Nebraska offensive lineman John Raridon pave the way didn\u2019t hurt.', \u201cWorking through the playoffs last year and getting to the UNI-Dome has definitely changed how I view the game,\u201d Lombardi said. \u201cAnd the size and speed of everything has calmed down.\u201d', Raridon was an early example of Valley\u2019s youth movement, getting four years of varsity experience at a position that typically requires the physical maturity of juniors or seniors. Adding years of training to his natural ability allowed the team to feed off that experience and leadership. And the next batch of underclassmen would become even more inclined to listen to a lineman that would eventually be a three-time elite all-state selection.', \u201cJohn had trained at a different level than most kids his age and was just ready to do it,\u201d Swenson said. \u201cBut even with him, we would have preferred to have left him with his age group.', \u201cIt\u2019s never a scientific decision.

Lombardi is a quarterback following in his older brother Rocky\u2019s footsteps, for now. Fugate is a versatile athlete that Rivals threw on its \u201cFab 15\u201d out of the Pro Football Hall of Fame Academy\u2019s showcase last month.', Receiver Luke Matney is with Mason among last year\u2019s sophomores who got significant touches.', \u201cI think it\u2019s an advantage to get that experience,\u201d Swenson said. \u201cBut it\u2019s what they do with it that matters.\u201d', Ben Campos is back for his third varsity campaign as well. A middle linebacker and younger brother of Iowa State offensive lineman Jake, Campos says what he gained getting pulled up early to play with Valley\u2019s massive varsity roster was priceless. He\u2019s been the team\u2019s top tackler for the last two years.', \u201cIt was really intimidating,\u201d Campos said. \u201cI got to come up to varsity practice as a freshman, so when I was a sophomore, I wouldn\u2019t say I was used to the speed, but I had seen it before. That was great to have under my belt.\u201d', His senior class includes other major contributors who have played more than the traditional two varsity seasons. Receiver Austin Hinkle had 41 catches for 758 yards and eight touchdowns last season. Kicker Cole Hahn has made 15 field goals and 111 PATs in three previous seasons with the Tigers. Tough runner Austin Koch is in his third year backing up Mason, Sam Rogers is on the offensive line, and Noah Barr is back in the secondary.', Buy Photo',  ', (Photo: Brian Powers/Register file photo)', They all adapted quickly to a tight-knit locker room and tremendously deep lineup.', \u201cThey treated me like any other guy,\u201d Campos. \u201cI was trying to keep afloat and do my job. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been focused on ever since. I know if I do my job, the people next to me are going to do theirs.', \u201cNow it\u2019s my senior year. It might sound cliché, but I\u2019m ready to play my heart out.\u201d', The expectation at Valley Stadium is that the experience of talented young players will get the Tigers back to double-digit wins.', \u201cAt smaller schools, it\u2019s not uncommon at all to have ninth and 10th graders playing, but it\u2019s a numbers game,\u201d Swenson said.', \u201cIt\u2019s not magic.
