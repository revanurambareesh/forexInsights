                HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE CHAKRADHARI SHARAN
                SINGH
    JUDGMENT & ORDER
         C.A.V.
',     (Per: HONOURABLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE)
    Date: 27-09-2016

                          The   present        writ   petitions   have   been   filed

         challenging the levy and collection of entry tax on goods

         brought by the petitioners to the State of Bihar for individual

         consumers, who reside in the State of Bihar, and which are

         transacted using electronic commerce portal (E-commerce).

',                      2. The petitioners are Private Limited Company and

         are engaged in the business of providing logistics and delivery

         services to various individual buyers, who undertake purchase

         transactions through technology platform of M/s Flipkart

         Internet Private Limited ( in short "Flipkart Internet").

',                      3.         The petitioners are registered as a transporter

         within the provisions of the ', Bihar VAT Act', , 2005. In furtherance

         of their business objects, the petitioner of C.W.J.C. No.6155 of

         2016 entered into an agreement, dated 01.09.2015, and the

         petitioner of C.W.J.C. No.6202 of 2016 entered into an

         agreement, dated 01.01.2013, with M/S Flipkart Internet,

         Bangalore, for providing logistics services to the individual

         buyers, who are registered on the website of Flipkart Internet

         Pvt Ltd, viz, www.flipkart.com. Business model, adopted by the

         petitioner for Flipkart Internet, is that the online portal,

         www.flipkart.com, works as an online market place, whereby
 Patna High Court CWJC No.6155 of 2016 dt.27-09-2016

',                                         3/89', 




         goods of various sellers, who are registered in the respective

         States, under the VAT/ ', Central Sales Tax Act',  laws, are

         displayed.
', 
',                      4. As per the specific terms of use of the said portal,

         the goods, which are purchased by the purchaser- customers,

         are meant for personal use or consumption only and are not for

         subsequent sale. The customers purchase identified goods from

         amongst the various goods displayed for sale on the portal.

         Once the identified/required/desired goods are purchased by a

         customer and the seller has received the orders from the

         customer, the petitioners undertake logistics support for such

         sellers. The sale between the concerned sellers and customers,

         in the present cases, where the goods are situated outside the

         State of Bihar, consummates prior to the petitioners\u201f taking

         delivery for providing logistics support and the appropriate CST

         is paid on such goods by the concerned seller. Package, along

         with invoice, is handed over to the petitioners for delivery

         directly to the customers at the destination addressed.

',                      5.         The State legislature of Bihar, enacted the

         Bihar Tax on Entry of Goods into Local Areas for consumption,

         Use or ', Sale Therein Act', , 1993, (hereinafter referred to as the

         "1993 Act"), with a view to levy tax on entry of goods into local

         areas for consumption, use or sale therein. The Bihar Entry of

         Goods Into Local Area Rules, 1993, (hereinafter referred to as

         the "1993 Rules") were framed to give effect to the provisions
 Patna High Court CWJC No.6155 of 2016 dt.27-09-2016

',                                           4/89', 




         of the 1993 Act. However, the 1993 Act was declared ultra

         vires Articles 301 and 304 of the Constitution of India by the

         judgment of this Court in ', Bihar Chamber of Commerce vs.

         State of Bihar', , (1995) 97 STC 53. The said judgment of this

         Court was subsequently reversed by the Supreme Court in

         ', State of Bihar vs. Bihar Chamber of Commerce', , reported

         in (1996) 9 SCC 136, wherein it was held, by applying the

         decision, in Bhagatram vs. CST, reported in 1995 Supp (1)

         SCC      673,     that     the      levy,    under   the   1993   Act,   was

         compensatory in nature and, hence, did not violate ', Article 301', 

         of the Constitution.
', 
',                      6. The said decision of the Supreme Court, in Bihar

         Chamber of Commerce (supra), was, later on, overruled by

         the decision of the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court, in

         ', Jindal Stainless Ltd. vs. State of Haryana', , reported in

         (2006) 7 SCC 241.
', 
',                      7. By the Bihar Tax on Entry of Goods into Local Areas

         for Consumption, Use or ', Sale Therein (Amendment) Act', , 2001,

         the 1993 Act was amended. In terms of the ', Amendment Act',  of

         2001, the definition of \u2015entry of goods\u2016 was amended and the

         following proviso to ', Section 2(c)',  was inserted:

',                                     \u2015Provided that in case of such goods which
                        are liable to tax under Section 12(1) of the Bihar
                        Finance Act, 1991, entry of goods shall mean entry
                        of goods into local area from a new place outside
                        the State for consumption, use or sale therein.\u2016
 Patna High Court CWJC No.6155 of 2016 dt.27-09-2016

',                                         5/89', 




',                      8.         Amendment was also made in Section 3 by

         inserting second Proviso to Section 3(2), which read as under:
', 
',                                     \u2015Provided further that where an importer of
                          scheduled goods liable to pay tax under the Act,
                          incurs tax liability, at the rate specified under
                          ', Section 13',  of the Bihar Value Added Tax Act, 2005
                          (Act 27 of 2005), by virtue of sale of imported
                          scheduled goods or sale of goods manufactured by
                          consuming such imported scheduled goods, his tax
                          liability under the ', Bihar Value Added Tax Act', , 2005
                          (Act 27 of 2005) shall stand reduced to the extent
                          of tax paid under the Act.\u2016

',                           9. With the insertion of the second Proviso to

         ', Section 3(2)',  of the 1993 Act, the taxable liability of a person

         on a scheduled goods imported in the State of Bihar, shall

         stand reduced to the extent of tax paid under the Act.', 

',                           10. The 1993 Act was further amended by the Bihar

         Tax on Entry of Goods Into Local Areas for Consumption, Use

         or ', Sale Therein (Amendment) Act', , 2003. By this amendment,

         the maximum rate of entry tax was revised from 5% to 20%

         and a number of other goods were added to the Schedule of

         the 1993 Act. Further, by another amending Act, namely, Bihar

         Tax on Entry of Goods Into Local Areas for Consumption, Use

         or Sale Therein (Amendment and ', Validation) Act', , 2003, an

         explanation has been added. This Explanation to the definition

         of \u2015entry of goods\u2016, goods, coming from outside the territory of

         India, were also brought within the purview of the Act. Both

',                                         6/89', 




         the aforesaid amendments of 2003 were made without prior

         sanction of the President of India.', 

',                      11. By the Bihar Finance Act of 2006, the 1993 Act

         was, again, amended by insertion of a proviso to ', Section 3(2)', ,

         which stipulated that the facility of adjustment towards sales

         tax would not be available on goods that were exempted from

         payment of sales tax in terms of any notification issued under

         Section 7(3) of the Bihar Finance Act, 1981. The said proviso

         was inserted retrospectively with effect from 25.02.1993. The

         proviso, as inserted by the Bihar Finance Act, 2006, reads, as

         under:
', 
',                                     \u2015Provided also that if the sale of such
                        scheduled goods is exempted from tax under any
                        notification issued under sub-section (3) of Section
                        7 of the Bihar Finance Act, 1981, reduction of his
                        liability under the Bihar Finance Act, 1981 as
                        provided       in      this   section   or   any   notification
                        thereunder, issued shall not be made.\u2016

',                      12. In the same year, i.e., in 2006, pursuant to the

         decision of the Supreme Court, in Jindal Stainless (supra),

         Bihar Tax on Entry of Goods into Local Areas for Consumption,

         Use or ', Sale Therein (Amendment) Act', , 2006, underwent

         various amendments in the 1993 Act including amendments to

         the second Proviso to ', Section 3(2)',  extending the adjustments

         of entry tax against also the sales tax liability to the sale of

         manufactured goods by consuming the imported scheduled

',                                         7/89', 




         goods.', 

',                      13. The amendments, so made by the 2001 Act, 2003

         Act and 2006 Act, were challenged before this Court in ', Indian

         Oil Corporation Limited vs. State of Bihar', , [2007] 10 VST

         140 (Patna), and this Court, upon considering the changes

         made to the 1993 Act by way of the aforesaid amendments,

         held that the parent 1993 Act, before its amendment, was not

         compensatory in character and was, therefore, violative of

         ', Article 301',  of the Constitution. The Court, however, held that

         the Act was nevertheless saved by virtue of ', Article 304(b)',  of

         the Constitution and the decision, in Bihar Chamber of

         Commerce (supra), to that extent, remains subsisting till date.

         The Court further held that the ', Amendment Act', s 10 of 2001

         and 9 of 2003 were bad, because of being violative of ', Article

         304(a)',  of the Constitution and, further, that amendments had

         been made without the previous sanction of the President. It

         was also held that the introduction of imported goods, within

         the    definition     of   "entry     of     goods",   was    bad    for   being

         retrospective        as     also      for     want     of    the    Presidential

         sanction/assent. The Court further held that after the 2006

         amendment, the levy, under the 1993 Act, acquired the nature

         of a compensatory tax and the 1993 Act, therefore, is a valid

         piece of legislation. However, on the question as to whether

         amendments, made in the 1993 Act, were discriminatory or

         not, this Court upheld the validity only on the basis that there
 Patna High Court CWJC No.6155 of 2016 dt.27-09-2016

',                                           8/89', 




         was a provision of set-off in terms of the second Proviso to

         ', Section 3(1)',  of the 1993 Act.
', 
',                      14. Fresh amendments to the 1993 Act were made by

         the Bihar Finance Act, 2015, to ensure levy of entry tax on

         goods, brought into the State of Bihar, on account of

         transactions undertaken by individual consumers through e-

         commerce. By the said ', Finance Act',  of 2015, the definition of

         "dealer", under the 1993 Act, has been substituted as under:

', u"                                    \u2015(b)      \u2017Dealer'    means        any   person   who,
                        whether regularly or otherwise, in the course of
                        business, buys, sells, supplies, distributes or does
                        anything       incidental        to     such    buying,     selling,
                        supplying or             distributing of goods,        directly or
                        indirectly,       whether      for    cash,     or   for   deferred
                        payment or for commission, remuneration or other
                        valuable consideration and it includes-

         Constitution.
', 
',                      19. We have heard Dr. Ashok Saraf, learned Senior

         Counsel assisted by Mr. T. Gulati and Mr. S. Chetia on behalf of

         the    petitioners,      and     Mr.    Lalit   Kishore,   learned   Principal

         Additional Advocate General, appearing on behalf of the

         respondents.
', 
',                      20. Contending that the impugned provisions of the

         1993 Act, as amended by the ', Amendment Act',  of 2015, are

         discriminatory against goods, which are brought in by the

         petitioners for personal use or consumption of individual

         consumers, Dr. Saraf submits that the impugned provisions

         create a tax or a fiscal barrier on such goods, which are

         brought in on account of an inter-State sale transaction and on

         which full rate of Central Sales Tax (in short, \u201eCST\u201f) is being

         paid. The impugned levy of entry tax on the goods brought into

         the State of Bihar, contends Dr. Saraf, is a colorable exercise of

         power by the State of Bihar to levy sales tax on goods brought

         into the State of Bihar on account of e-commerce transactions.

         It is submitted by Dr. Saraf that the impugned levy, in pith and

         substance, being sales tax/VAT, in the garb of levy of entry

         tax, violates ', Article 286',  of the Constitution.

',                      21. Referring to the definition of "entry of goods"

         given under ', Section 2(c)',  of the 1993 Act and the charging

         provisions of ', Section 3',  of the said Act, Dr. Saraf submits that

         where goods are exigible to tax in terms of sales tax law in the

         State of Bihar, i.e., the ', Bihar VAT Act', , 2005, entry for the

         purpose of levy of entry tax would be only when the goods are

         coming from outside the State of Bihar and, in such cases,

         where the goods move from one local area to another local

         area, the same is not liable to entry tax. This apart, contends

         Dr. Saraf, that if VAT is paid on the goods brought in from

         outside the State of Bihar under the ', Bihar VAT Act', , 2005, no

         entry tax is payable inasmuch as the payment of entry tax is

         liable to be set off against the VAT liability on such goods.

         Further, no entry tax is levied on goods, which are exempted

         from payment of VAT in terms of the third Proviso to ', Section

         3(2)',  of the 1993 Act.
', 
',                      22. Coupled with the above, Dr. Saraf submits that

         the impugned levy of entry tax, in pith and substance, is a tax

         on goods, which are brought into the State of Bihar on account

         of inter-State sale transactions on which the State of Bihar

         cannot levy VAT inasmuch as wherever VAT is leviable, there is

         set off against the VAT so payable. The State of Bihar, submits

         Dr. Saraf, realizing the limitation imposed on it by ', Article

         286(1)(a)',  of Constitution of India, which prohibits the State

         from taxing inter-State sale transactions has evolved a novel

',                                         15/89', 




         way of contravening ', Article 286(1)(a)',  of Constitution by

         selectively taxing inter-State transactions of sale in the garb of

         entry tax.
', 
',                      23. It is submitted by the learned Senior Counsel, Dr.

         Saraf, that in terms of ', Article 286(1)(a', ), the State does not

         have the legislative competence to impose tax on sale or

         purchase of goods, when sale or purchase takes place outside

         the State; whereas, the impugned proviso, in pith and

         substance, seeks to levy tax on the sale transactions, which

         stand already concluded outside the State, and the movement

         of goods, in the State of Bihar, is only for personal use or

         consumption for individual consumers.
', 
',                      24. In support of his above submissions, Dr. Saraf,

         places reliance on the decision of the Gauhati High Court, in

         ', ITC Ltd vs. State of Assam', , (2007) 9 VST 250.                It is

         further submitted by Dr. Saraf that the impugned levy of entry

         tax on goods brought by the petitioners to the State of Bihar,

         for individual consumer on account of e-commerce transaction,

         is discriminatory and thereby violative of ', Article 14', , 19(1)(g)', 

         and ', 304(a)',  of the Constitution of India.
', 
',                      25. It is further submitted by Dr. Saraf that the

         impugned levy of entry tax on goods, brought into the State of

         Bihar by the petitioners on account of an e-commerce

         transactions, is discriminatory against such goods violating

         ', Article 304 (a)',  of the Constitution of India. In so far as other
 Patna High Court CWJC No.6155 of 2016 dt.27-09-2016

',                                         16/89', 




         goods, which are brought into the State of Bihar, and which are

         for further resale or for consumption in the manufacture of

         goods, a set off/reduction of VAT is provided against the

         payment of entry tax to ensure that there is only a single

         incidence of tax. The effect thereof, submits Dr. Saraf, is that if

         the CST paid goods are not sold, but are used for personal

         consumption, the cumulative tax burden on such goods is

         much higher.
', 
',                      26. In support of his plea that              the    impugned

         provisions providing for levy of entry tax on the goods brought

         into the State of Bihar, on account of e-commerce transaction,

         is discriminatory, Dr. Saraf has tried to explain the same by

         four different situations by giving following examples:

',                      Scenario 1- Tax burden on Goods brought in by a

         Dealer, registered under the ', Bihar VAT Act', , for the

         purpose of resale in the State of Bihar: Where goods are

         brought in for the purpose of resale either on account of a

         Stock Transfer or on the basis of C-form or a direct inter-State

         sale, in terms of the second proviso to ', Section 3',  (2), the

         payment of Entry tax under the Act will stand reduced from the

         VAT to be paid on the goods as under:-

        submits that on account of non-availability of set off in terms of

        proviso to ', Section 3(2)', , the imposition of entry tax, by way of

        impugned provisions, leads to a higher tax burden on such
 Patna High Court CWJC No.6155 of 2016 dt.27-09-2016

        goods, which are brought into the State of Bihar by the

        petitioner      for   personal      use       or   consumption    of   individual

        consumers and which are transacted using an e-commerce

        portal. Therefore, the levy of entry tax, on the goods so brought

        into the State of Bihar by the petitioners, acts as a tax or fiscal

        barrier on the inter-State movement of such goods and is also

        discriminatory        against      such       goods.   It   has   been   further

        submitted that on account of levy, introduced by impugned

        amendment made in the 1993 Act, goods, purchased by an

        individual consumer, when bought from any seller outside the

        State of Bihar using an e-commerce portal, will be liable to

        suffer a higher rate of tax and thereby become costlier for the

        consumer as compared to the same goods, when purchased

        from a local dealer in the State of Bihar.
', 
',                      29. With regard to the above, Dr. Saraf submits that

         the artificial distinction and discrimination against the said

         goods purchased through an e-commerce portal arises on

         account of the second Proviso to ', Section 3(2)', , which restricts

         the set off of entry tax paid on such goods only to a dealer,

         who is liable to pay VAT under the ', Bihar VAT Act', , 2005. In

         respect of the aforesaid submissions, reliance has been placed

         on the decisions of this Court in Indian Oil Corporation

         Limited (supra) and ', Food Corporation of India vs. State of

         Bihar', , reported in (2008) 2 PLJR 69.

         Corporation Limited (supra), this Court held that the Act was

         saved from being held discriminatory against goods, which are

         brought in on account of an inter-State transactions only on

         account of the proviso to ', Section 3',  (2), which ensured that the

         goods from other States are given similar tax treatment as that

         of locally manufactured/ sold goods.
', 
',                      31. However, in the present case, submits Dr. Saraf,

         the said second Proviso to ', Section 3(2)',  is not applicable to the

         transaction undertaken through e-commerce portal inasmuch

         as the goods, which are brought in by the petitioners, are only

         for personal use or consumption and not for being sold. Where

         the individual consumer are not \u201edealers\u201f and do not have

         liability under the ', Bihar VAT Act', , 2005, the payment of entry

         tax, on such transactions, will be an additional cost on such

         goods.
', 
',                      32. It is submitted by Dr. Saraf in Indian Oil

         Corporation Limited (supra), this Court held the amendment

         to the 1993 Act as discriminatory in the case of a petitioner,

         when the set off was not made applicable. Similarly, in Food

         Corporation of India (supra), the Court struck down the

         notification, whereby entry tax was imposed at a rate higher

         than the rate of sales tax on those goods. Reliance was also

         placed by Dr. Saraf on the decision of the Supreme Court in

         State of U.P. Vs. Jaiprakash Associates Ltd, reported in

         (2014) 4 SCC 17, wherein the notifications, under the Uttar

         Pradesh Trade Tax Act, 1948, granting rebate of tax on goods

         manufactured, in the State of Uttar Pradesh, were challenged

         on the ground of being discriminatory against goods imported

         from neighbouring States and violating ', Article 301',  and ', 304(a).', 

         Placing reliance on the aforesaid decision of the Supreme

         Court, in Jaiprakash Associates (supra), it is submitted that

         set off, as granted by proviso to ', Section 3(2)',  of the 1993 Act,

         is in the nature of a rebate.
', 
',                      33. Relying on the decision of the Supreme Court in

         Jaiprakash Associates (supra), it is submitted by Dr. Saraf

         that granting of set off of entry tax against VAT, payable under

         the ', Bihar VAT Act', , 2005, is only applicable, when the goods are

         imported from outside the State for the purpose of resale

         within the State. No such set off is available, when goods are

         imported from outside the State for the purpose of personal

         use or consumption and, as such, the grant of set off, which is

         in the nature of rebate or exemption, discriminates between

         the goods, which are imported for the purpose of resale, and

         the goods, which are imported for the purpose of personal use

         or consumption inasmuch as the goods, which are imported

         from outside the State for the purpose of use or consumption,

         has to bear the burden of the CST as well as entry tax,

         whereas the goods, which are imported from outside the State

         for the purpose of resale, do not have to bear the burden of

         entry tax and, as such, the goods, brought in for personal use
 Patna High Court CWJC No.6155 of 2016 dt.27-09-2016

',                                         23/89', 




         or consumption, has to bear higher burden of tax.

',                      34. It is, therefore, submitted by Dr. Saraf that when

         a dealer, who makes a sale of goods from outside the State to

         a consumer in the State of Bihar, the total burden of tax on

         him is much higher than a dealer, who makes a sale, within the

         State, to a consumer. This clearly violates ', Article 304 (a)',  of the

         Constitution of India; so contends Dr. Saraf.

',                      35. It is also submitted that the impugned levy of

         entry tax is also discriminatory and unreasonable being

         violative of ', Article 14',  and ', 19(1)(g)',  of the Constitution. It is

         submitted, in this regard, that it is obligatory on the part of the

         respondents to give equal treatment to locally sold goods as

         well as goods, which are purchased by the consumers, on

         account of an inter-State sale; whereas, the effect of the

         impugned provisions is that higher burden of tax is imposed

         only on such goods, which are transacted through an e-

         commerce portal and brought in by the petitioners for personal

         use    or    consumption         by    the   individual   consumers   and,

         therefore, the same is, according to Dr. Saraf, violative of

         ', Article 14',  and ', 19(1)(g)',  of the Constitution of India.

',                      36. Mr. Lalit Kishore, learned Principal Additional

         Advocate General, appearing on behalf of the respondents,

         submits that the 1993 Act has already been held to be

         compensatory and, consequently, the issue, as regards the

         validity of the 1993 Act, according to learned Principal
 Patna High Court CWJC No.6155 of 2016 dt.27-09-2016

',                                         24/89', 




         Additional Advocate General, must be taken to have already

         been decided by this Court, in Indian Oil Corporation

         (supra), and, therefore, the validity of the impugned provisions

         of the 1993 Act cannot, again, be looked into in the present

         writ petition. Learned Principal Additional Advocate General

         also submits that the impugned provisions are merely the

         machinery provision and, hence, levy of entry tax, on e-

         commerce transactions, were all along present in the 1993 Act

         prior to 2015 and this has already been upheld by this Court, in

         Indian Oil Corporation (supra). It is submitted that the levy

         of entry tax is irrespective of the fact whether the goods are

         brought into the State directly by the consumer/individual

         buyer thereof or has been imported into the State for

         subsequent sale and, therefore, contends Mr. Lalit Kishore, the

         levy cannot be treated as discriminatory on this count.

',                      37. The learned Principal Additional Advocate General

         submits that the petitioners are also part of the same trade,

         and maintained from the proceeds of the levy and, therefore,

         once the levy has been held to be compensatory, the

         petitioners cannot challenge the validity of the same. It is

         contended by the learned Principal Additional Advocate General

         that the levy of entry tax, even if found to be discriminatory,

         has to be upheld if the entry tax, so levied, is found to be

         compensatory and, hence, the same cannot be challenged on

         the ground that the levy of entry tax is violative of ', Article

         304(a)',  of the Constitution of India. Permitting set off is not a

         condition precedent for upholding the validity of the levy of

         entry tax, contends learned Principal Additional Advocate

         General, because entry tax can be levied even if VAT/sales tax

         is not payable. The learned Principal Additional Advocate

         General, therefore, contends that the writ petition has got no

         merit and the same is liable to be dismissed.

',                      38. Reacting to the submissions made on behalf of the

         respondents, Dr. Ashok Saraf, learned Senior Counsel, submits

         that the decision of this Court, in Indian Oil Corporation

         (supra), has been misconstrued. It is submitted that this Court,

         in Indian Oil Corporation (supra), although held that after

         the     2006      amendment,           the   levy,   under   the   Act,   is

         compensatory, yet the question as to whether the validity of

         the levy can be upheld, even if such a compensatory Act is

         distinctly violative of ', Article 304(a)',  of the Constitution, has not

         been decided by this Court in Indian Oil Corporation (supra)

         as the period involved, in the aforesaid case, was prior to the

         year 2006.
',

         of entry tax, on transactions undertaken through e-commerce,

         and, further, colourable exercise of powers to impose sales tax,

         under the garb of entry tax, were not in issue in Indian Oil

         Corporation (supra). Dr. Saraf, learned Senior Counsel,

         submits that it is incorrect to say that only machinery

         provisions have been brought in by the impugned amendments

         in the Act; rather, contends Dr. Saraf, substantive changes

         have been made in the 1993 Act to ensure that entry tax is

         levied on transactions of e-commerce, where goods are

         brought into the State of Bihar for personal consumption and

         use of individual buyers.
', 
',                      40. It is not disputed by the respondents, submits Dr.

         Saraf, that there was no machinery provision in the 1993 Act

         prior to the impugned amendments and, therefore, the

         impugned provisions are seeking to provide for a mechanism to

         impose entry tax on e-commerce transactions. Dr. Saraf

         further submits that the goods, brought into the State of Bihar

         for   personal       use     or     consumption,     were,   otherwise,   not

         subjected to entry tax inasmuch as there was no machinery

         provision to collect entry tax and by creating a specific

         machinery for collection of entry tax, when the goods are sold

         for personal use or consumption through the medium of e-

         commerce,         the      provisions        seek   to   create    a   blatant

         discrimination against such goods and seek to put a restrain on

         e-commerce transactions.
', 
',                      41. To reboost his submissions, Dr. Saraf points out

         that the impugned provisions are to ensure that the cumulative

         burden is higher on such goods, which have been held to be

         \u2015fiscal    barrier\u2016     by        the     Supreme   Court    in   Jaiprakash

         Associates (supra). Such a fiscal barrier has an immediate

         and direct effect of ensuring that the goods are not brought in

         from outside the State of Bihar, by resorting to e-commerce for

         personal use or consumption on payment of CST and thereby a

         preferential treatment has been accorded by the State of Bihar

         to the dealers in Bihar, which directly contravenes ', Article

         304(a)',  of the Constitution. Further, it is submitted that a gross

         discrimination has been created by selectively creating a

         machinery for taxing and collecting tax only on e-commerce

         transactions, whereas there was no machinery to collect tax on

         goods brought in for personal use or consumption through

         normal means.

         before us and the materials on record, let us, now, examine the

         compromise         of the      territories of the   States, the   Union

         territories and such other territories as may be acquired. It is in

         the backdrop of the fact that ', Article 1',  conceives India as a

         Union of States that the constitutional scheme for the conduct

         of trade, commerce and intercourse, contained in Part XIII,

         needs to be analysed.

         the two expressions used in ', Article 301', , namely, "throughout

         the territory of India" and "subject to the other provisions of

         the part". The use of the words "throughout the territory of

         India" shows that Part XIII conceives India as one economic

         unit. To appreciate as to why ', Article 301',  guarantees freedom

         of trade, commerce and intercourse "throughout the territory of

         India", the background in which ', Article 301',  came to be enacted

         needs to be borne in mind.

         over,     was     mainly     agricultural    based.   There   were   small

         principalities and very little quantity of goods moved from one

         area to another, because goods were, ordinarily, produced for

         consumption by the producers themselves, such as, land-

         owners and their tenants. Petty artisans, normally, produced

         very little commodities for sale. With the industrial revolution,

         expansion of industries took place, which gave rise to larger

         production of goods and this resulted in to faster movement of

         goods to distant places. The trade-barriers were, therefore,

         required to be minimized in order to avoid obstructions to the

         free movement of goods.

         Constitution conceived India as a strong economic unit, it was

         but natural for them to introduce into our Constitution a

         meaningful scheme for growth of industries so as to strengthen

         economic base of India as a whole. The makers of our

         Constitution knew that no meaningful growth of industries is

         achievable unless obstructions, in the movement of the goods,

         were, if not completely removed, be, at least, reduced as much

         as possible.

         for independence achieved success, for, with the end of the

         Second World War, countries were struggling to overcome the

         disastrous consequences, which the war had brought. It was an

         age, when the people, all over the world, were struggling for

         space and everyone wanted to have greater say in the

         governance of their respective countries. British empire had

         fragmented and struggle to occupy he void created by the fall

         of the British empire had had fragmented and struggle to

         occupy the void created by the fall of the British empire

         intestified. It was in such a period of transition from colonial

         rule to a rule of self-governance that the constitution of India

         was in prepared. What our constitution-makers witnessed and

         experienced had its reflection in our Constitution. The concept

         of entry tax is a concept routed in history. Before the industrial

         revolution, the society, world over was mainly agriculture

         based, there were small principalities and very little quantity of

         goods moved from one area to another, because gods were,

         ordinarily,     produced        for    consumption   by   the   producers

         themselves, such as, land-owners and their tenants. Petty

         artisans, normally, produced very little commodities for sale.

         With the industrial revolution, industries grew and this resulted

         into faster movement of goods, which forms an integral and

         inseparable part of commerce. The situation in India was no

         different. As the makers of our Constitution conceived India as

         a strong economic unit, it was but natural for them to knit into

         the scheme of our Constitution the concept of a meaningful

         growth of industries so as strengthen economic base of India.

         This was not possible to achieve unless obstructions in the

         at least, reduced as much as possible.

         world,     particularly,       Europe        was   fragmented      into   small

         principalities having toll-barriers imposing toll taxes and these

         toll-barriers caused obstructions to the movement of goods.

         Such obstructions to the free flow of goods from one

         principality to another caused hindrance to the growth of

         industries      and     commerce        in    those   countries.    Gradually,

         therefore, these trade barriers were started being removed.

         Having witnessed the history of development of industries all

         over the world, and in order to give India strong economic

         base, the makers of our Constitution incorporated, in Part XIII,

         a specific constitutional scheme for conduct of trade, commerce

         and intercourse. It is in the backdrop of these historical

         realities that the present writ petitions have to be considered.

         and intercourse were guaranteed to be free throughout the

         territory of India, which, as ', Article 1',  reflects, consists of

         various States and Union territories.

         needs some regulations and regulatory measures, the freedom

         of trade, commerce and intercourse, too, could not have been

         left absolutely free or completely without any regulation. It is in

         this light that the words "Subject to the other provisions of this

         part", occurring in ', Article 301', , need to be read. Some of these

         aspects of our Constitutional scheme succinctly surface from

         the decision of the Constitution Bench, in ', Atiabari Tea

         Company Limited v. State of Assam',  (AIR 1961 SC 232),

         wherein the Court, at paragraph 33, observed as follows:

                        essential for the stability and progress of the federal
                        policy which has been adopted by the Constitution

                        economic theories or ideologies may come in power
                        in the several constituent units of the Union, and
                        that may conceivably give rise to local and regional
                        pulls and pressures in economic matters. Local or

                        considerations were may profitably refer to the

         Tea     Company          Limited         (supra),     it    is    clear    that   our

         Constitution makers wanted to ensure freedom of movement

         and exchange of goods throughout the territory of India in

         order to strengthen the economic base of the nation and for

         sustaining       and     improving           the   living    standard       of    our

', 
',                                     \u201549. Let us now revert to ', article 301',  and
                        ascertain the width and amplitude of its scope. On a
                        careful examination of the relevant provisions of
                        Part XIII as a whole as well as the principle of
                        economic unity which it is intended to safeguard by
                        making the said provisions, the conclusion appears
                        to us to be inevitable that the content of freedom
                        provided for by ', article 301',  was larger than the
                        freedom contemplated by',  s. 297',  of the Constitution
                        Act of 1935, and whatever else it may or may not
                        include, it certainly includes movement of trade
                        which is of the very essence of all trade and is its
                        integral part. If the transport or the movement of
                        goods is taxed solely on the basis that the goods
                        are thus carried or transported that, in our opinion,
                        directly      affects         the        freedom   of    trade    as
                        contemplated by ', article 301.',  If the movement,
                        transport or the carrying of goods is allowed to be
                        impeded,       obstructed           or    hampered      by   taxation
                        without satisfying the requirements of Part XIII the
                        freedom of trade on which so much emphasis is laid
                        by ', article 301',  would turn to be illusory. When ', art.
                        301',  provides that trade shall be free throughout the
                        territory of India primarily is the movement or the
                        transport part of trade must be free subject of
                        course to the limitations and exceptions provided by
                        the other articles of Part XIII. That we think is the
                        result of ', article 301',  read with the other Articles in
                        Part XIII\u2016.',

         flow of goods and that the growth of trade or commerce is not

         possible to achieve unless the movement of goods is made free

         from unreasonable fiscal barriers, ', Article 301',  seeks to ensure

         that tax shall not be imposed on movement of goods solely for

         the reason that the goods are carried to or transported through

         a given State, for, if such restrictions are not avoided, the

         freedom of trade cannot be achieved.
', 
',                      54. Addressing, therefore, the question as to whether

         tax laws are excluded from the provisions of Part XIII and

         whether tax laws are immune from the freedom guaranteed

         under ', article 301', , the Supreme Court, in Atiabari Tea

         Company Limited (supra), observed:
', 
',                                     \u201550. Thus the intrinsic evidence furnished
                        by some of the Articles of Part XIII shows that
                        taxing laws are not excluded from the operation of
                        ', article 301 ;',  which means that tax laws can and do
                        amount to restrictions freedom from which is
                        guaranteed to trade under the said Part. Does that
                        mean that all tax laws attract the provisions of Part
                        XIII whether their impact on trade or its movement
                        is direct and immediate or indirect and remote? It is
                        precisely because the words used in ', article 301',  are
                        very wide, and in a sense vague and indefinite that
                        the problem of construing them and determining
                        their exact width and scope becomes complex and
                        difficult. However ; in interpreting the provisions of
                        the Constitution we must always bear in mind that
                        the relevant provision \u2015has to be read not in vacuo
                        but as occurring in a single complex instrument in
                        which one part may throw light on another\u2016. (Vide..

                        578, 613). In construing ', article 301',  we must,
                        therefore, have regard to the general scheme of our
                        Constitution as well as the particular provisions in
                        regard to taxing laws. The construction of ', article
                        301',  should not be determined on a purely academic
                        or doctrinaire considerations ; in construing the said
                        article we must adopt a realistic approach and bear
                        in mind the essential features of the separation of
                        powers on which our constitution rests. It is a
                        federal constitution which we are interpreting, and
                        so the impact of ', article 301',  must be judged
                        accordingly.        Besides,   it   is   not   irrelevant   to
                        remember in this connection that the article we are
                        construing imposes a constitutional limitation on the
                        power of the Parliament and State Legislatures to
                        levy taxes, and generally, but for such limitation,
                        the power of taxation would be presumed to be for
                        public good and would not be subject to judicial
                        review or scrutiny. Thus, considered we think it
                        would be reasonable and proper to hold that
                        restrictions freedom from which is guaranteed by
                        ', article 301', , would be such restrictions as directly
                        and immediately restrict or impede the free flow or
                        movement of trade. Taxes may and do amount to
                        restrictions ; but it is only such taxes as directly and
                        immediately restrict trade that would fall within the
                        purview of ', article 301.',  The argument that all taxes
                        should be governed by ', article 301',  whether or not
                        their impact on trade is immediate or mediate direct
                        or remote, adopts, in our opinion, an extreme
                        approach which cannot be upheld. If the said
                        argument is accepted it would mean, for instance,

                        that even a legislative enactment prescribing the
                        minimum wages to industrial employees may fall
                        under Part XIII because in an economic sense an
                        additional wage bill may indirectly affect trade or
                        commerce. We are, therefore, satisfied that in
                        determining the limits of the width and amplitude of
                        the freedom guaranteed by ', article 301',  a rational
                        and workable test to apply would be: Does the
                        impugned           restriction    operate     directly    or
                        immediately on trade or its movement? It is in the
                        light of this test that we propose to examine the
                        validity of the Act under scrutiny in the present
                        proceedings.\u2016


',                      55. From the above observations made in Atiabari

         Tea Company Limited (supra), it is clear that the Supreme

         court answered, in the negative, the question as to whether the

         tax laws are immune from the operation of ', Article 301.',  Having

         held that tax laws were not immune from the operation of the

         ', Article 301',  or, for that matter, the constitutional scheme,

         embodied in Part XIII, the Constitution Bench, in Atiabari Tea

         Company Limited (supra), clarified that it is not all taxes, which

         will hit ', Article 301', , but only such taxes, which, directly and

         immediately, restrict trade, for, it is only direct restrictions

         causing impediments to the movement of goods that ', Article

         301',  seeks to avoid and nullify. It is in this light that the

         following      further      observations,       made   in   Atiabari    Tea

         Company Limited (supra), need to be read.

',                                          39/89', 




                        expedient to consider what other laws would be
                        affected by the interpretation we are placing on
                        ', article 301',  and what other legislative entries would
                        fall under Part XIII. We propose to confine our
                        decision to the Act with which we are concerned. If
                        any other laws are similarly challenged the validity
                        of the challenge will have to be examined in the
                        light of the provisions of those laws. Our conclusion,
                        therefore, is that when ', article 301',  provides that
                        trade shall be free throughout the territory of India
                        it means that the flow of trade shall run smooth and
                        unhampered          by    any      restriction    either         at    the
                        boundaries of the States or at any other points
                        inside     the     States      themselves.       It   is    the        free
                        movement or the transport of goods from one part
                        of the country to other that is intended to be saved,
                        and if any Act imposes any direct restrictions on the
                        very movement of such goods it attracts the
                        provisions of ', article 301', , and its validity can be
                        sustained only if it satisfies the requirements of
                        ', article 302',  or ', article 304',  of Part XIII. At this stage
                        we think it is necessary to repeat that when it is
                        said that the freedom of the movement of trade
                        cannot be subject to any restrictions in the form of
                        taxes imposed on the carriage of goods or their
                        movement all that is meant is that the said
                        restrictions       can        be   imposed       by        the        State
                        Legislatures only after satisfying the requirements
                        of ', article 304(b).',  It is not as if no restrictions at all
                        can be imposed on the free movement of trade."


',                      56. What, thus, surfaces from the above discussion, is

         that ', Article 301',  guarantees freedom of trade, commerce and
 Patna High Court CWJC No.6155 of 2016 dt.27-09-2016

         intercourse throughout the territory of India. It is, however, not

         freedom from all laws that ', Article 301',  aims at protecting;

         rather, it guarantees freedom only from such laws, which

         restrict or impede the movement or transportation of goods or

         adversely affect the activities of trade and commerce amongst

         the States.
', 
',                      57. In effect, ', Article 301',  casts an obligation on the

         legislative power of the Parliament and the States to ensure

         that the trade, commerce and intercourse throughout India

         shall be free. ', Article 301', , therefore, refers to freedom from

         laws, which go beyond regulations, and which put restrictions

         or prevent movement beyond States or within the States, for,

         ', Article 301',  applies not only to inter-State trade, commerce and

         intercourse, but also to intra-State trade, commerce and

         intercourse.
', 
',                      58. What may, now, be pointed out is that though

         ', Article 301',  restrains both the Union Legislature and the State

         Legislatures from enacting laws including tax laws, which

         create hindrance to the freedom of trade, commerce and

         intercourse throughout India, ', Article 302',  permits the Union

         Legislature to impose, by law, such restrictions on these

         freedoms as may be required in public interest. ', Article 303', ,

         however, clarifies that neither Parliament nor the Legislature of

         States shall have the power to make any law giving or

         authorizing the making of any discrimination between one

         State and another by virtue of any entry relating to trade and

         commerce in any of the Lists in the Seventh Schedule. In other

         words, ', Article 303',  clarifies that even in public interest,

         Parliament is not authorized to make laws giving preference to

         one State over the other. This restriction is, however, subject

         to one exception, the exception being that the Parliament is left

         with the discretion to make laws giving preferential treatment

         or making discriminatory provisions if such laws become

         necessary for the purpose of dealing with a situation arising

         from scarcity of goods in any part of the territory of India.

',                      59.    Thus,      a   State      Legislature,   apart   from   the

         limitation imposed by ', Article 301', , has the limitation of not

         making laws to give preference or make discrimination between

         one State and another, while making laws, in exercise of its

         powers, relating to trade, commerce and intercourse. However,

         this limitation, on the State Legislature, is lifted in two cases,

         namely, that the State may, under ', Article 304(a', ), impose, on

         goods, imported from sister States or Union territories, any tax

         to which similar goods, manufactured in its own State, are

         subjected, but not so as to discriminate between the imported

         goods and the goods manufactured in the State. In other

         words, ', Article 304(a)',  authorizes State Legislature to impose

         non-discriminatory tax on goods imported from sister States

         even if such law interferes with the freedom of trade,

         commerce and intercourse guaranteed by ', Article 301.',  The ban

         imposed,       under ', Article       303(1', ),       stands    lifted   even   when

         discriminatory restrictions are imposed by the State Legislature

         if   the     legislation      fulfils    three    conditions,       which ', Article

         304(b)', embodies,           namely,        that   such    restrictions   shall   be

         reasonable, the same shall be in public interest and, above all,

         no Bill or amendment for the purpose of Clause (b) or for

         making amendment thereto shall be introduced or moved in

         the Legislature of any State without previous sanction of the

         President. To be more precise, one can point out that even

         restrictions, which may be reasonable and are also in public

         interest, cannot be imposed on the freedom of trade and

         commerce unless prior sanction of the President has been

         obtained by the State before introduction of the Bill or before

         making the legislation.

',                      60. In short, while ', Article 301',  guarantees freedom of

         trade and commerce throughout India, this freedom is not

         absolute, for, in an orderly society, the conduct of trade and

         commerce cannot be left completely free from regulations.


',                      61.     Regulatory          measures,      therefore,    cannot    be

         regarded as impediments                  in the     freedom of trade and

         commerce. It is for this reason that the Constitution Bench, in

         Atiabari Tea Co. Ltd. (supra), makes it clear that though tax

         laws are not immune from ', Article 301', , all tax laws do not

         infringe ', Article 301.', 
',  Patna High Court CWJC No.6155 of 2016 dt.27-09-2016

',                                          43/89', 




',                      62. The question, which, naturally, arises is this: what

         can be these laws, which may hit ', Article 301',  or be treated as

         infringement of the guarantee given by ', Article 301?',  Since it is

         the movement part of the goods, which ', Article 301',  guarantees,

         the Supreme Court makes it clear, in Atiabari Tea Company

         Limited (supra), that only such tax laws, which, directly and

         immediately, impact the free flow of trade and commerce that

         will be impermissible under ', Article 301.',  However, a law, which

         has direct and immediate impact on the movement of goods,

         can be saved only if it falls in any of the permissible

         restrictions, which Articles 302, 303 and 304 perceive.


',                      63. It may also be noted that in Atiabari Tea

         Company Ltd. (supra), the three appellants before the

         Supreme Court were tea companies, two of whom carried on

         the trade of growing tea in Assam and the third one carried on

         its trade at Jalpaiguri. They carried their tea to Calcutta in

         order that it might be sold, in Calcutta, for consumption and

         sale outside India. Tea, produced in Jalpaiguri, had to move

         through a few miles of the territory of the State of Assam.

         Besides the tea, which was carried by railways, a substantial

         quantity of tea was also carried by road or by inland waterways

         and, as such, became liable to pay tax leviable under the

         Assam      Taxation       (on     goods      carried   by   roads   or   inland

         waterways) Act, 1954, for, this Act levied tax on certain goods,
 Patna High Court CWJC No.6155 of 2016 dt.27-09-2016

',                                          44/89', 




         such as, tea, which was carried by road and inland waterways.

         The principal ground of attack on the legislation was that it

         violated the provisions of ', Article 301',  and was not saved

         by ', Article 304(b).',  It is of immense importance to note that in

         Atiabari Tea Company Ltd. (supra), three views were

         expressed. The views, expressed in Atiabari Tea Company

         Ltd. (supra), by the learned Chief Justice BP Sinha, which the

         Supreme Court, in its subsequent judgment in Automobile

         Transport (Rajasthan) Ltd. (supra), described as the narrow

         view, was that taxation simpliciter was not within the ambit of

         ', Article    301',  and       a    tax,      on   the    movement     of    goods    or

         passengers,        did    not     necessarily       connote    impediment       or

         restraint in the matter of trade and commerce. Drawing a

         distinction between laws of taxation, which are enacted for the

         purpose of general revenue, and taxation laws, which are

         enacted for the purpose of making discrimination or giving

         preference, the learned Chief Justice took the view that taxing

         statutes, enacted for the purpose of general revenue, were

         outside the purview of ', Article 301',  and it is only those laws of

         taxation, which were              made       for    the   purpose     of making

         discrimination or giving preference, which fall within the ambit

         of ', Article 301.',  The learned Chief Justice concluded these views

         in the following words:
', 
', 
',                                       Thus,      on   a     fair   construction   of    the
                        provisions of Part XIII, the following propositions

',                                         45/89', 




                        emerge : (1) trade, commerce, and intercourse
                        throughout the territory of India are not absolutely
                        free, but are subject to certain powers of legislation
                        by Parliament or the Legislature of a State; (2) the
                        freedom declared by ', Article 301',  does not mean
                        freedom from taxation simpliciter, but does mean
                        freedom from taxation which has the effect of
                        directly impeding the free flow of trade, commerce
                        and     intercourse       ;     (3)     the    freedom   envisaged
                        in ', Article     301',  is         subject     to    non-discriminatory
                        restrictions (', Article 392', ); (4) even discriminatory or
                        preferential/legislation may be made by Parliament
                        for the purpose of dealing with an emergency like a
                        scarcity of goods in any part of India (', Article
                        303(2); (5)',  reasonable restrictions may be imposed

                        (', Article 304(b); (6)',  non-discriminatory taxes may
                        be imposed by the Legislature of a State on goods
                        imported from another State of other States, if
                        similar taxes are imposed on goods produced of
                        manufactured in that State (', Article 304(a);',  and
                        lastly (7) restrictions imposed by existing laws have
                        been continued, except in so far as the President
                        may by order otherwise direct (', article 305', ). (pp.
                        831-832).
', 
',                      64. The other view, which may be called the third

         view as expressed by Shah, J, and described, in Automobile

         Transport (Rajasthan) Ltd. (supra), as the widest view was

         that    the    freedom,       contemplated             under ', Article    301', ,   was

         freedom of trade, commerce and intercourse in every aspect of

         all such activities, which constitute commerce and intercourse
 Patna High Court CWJC No.6155 of 2016 dt.27-09-2016

',                                         46/89', 




         and not merely restrictions on the movement or transportation

         part of goods. Shah J (as his Lordship then was) expressed his

         view thus, "The guarantee of freedom of trade and commerce

         is not addressed merely against prohibitions, complete or

         partial ; it is addressed to tariffs, licensing, marketing

         regulations, price-control, nationalization, economic or social

         planning, discriminatory tariffs, compulsory appropriation of

         goods,      freezing     or    stand-still     orders    and   similar     other

         impediments         operating       directly   and      immediately   on    the

         freedom of commercial intercourse as well. Every sequence in

         the series of operations which constitutes trade or commerce is

         an act of trade or commerce and burdens or impediments

         imposed on any such step are restrictions on the freedom of

         trade or commerce and intercourse. What is guaranteed is

         freedom in its widest amplitude - freedom from prohibition,

         control, burden or impediment in commercial intercourse.


',                       65.     However,          the   majority,    in   Atiabari     Tea

         Company Ltd. (supra), differed from what the learned Chief

         Justice had concluded and did not accept as the correct

         proposition that tax laws are governed by Part XII of the

         Constitution and were outside Part XIII. The majority did not

         also agree with the views expressed by Shah, J. Hence,

         speaking for the majority, in Atiabari Tea Company Ltd.

         (supra), Gajendragadkar, J, observed as follows:
 Patna High Court CWJC No.6155 of 2016 dt.27-09-2016

',                                         47/89', 




                                     \u2015It is a federal constitution which we are
                        interpreting, and so the impact of ', Article 301',  must
                        be judged accordingly Besides, it is not irrelevant to
                        remember in this connection that the Article we are
                        construing imposes a constitutional limitation on the
                        power of the Parliament and the State Legislatures
                        to    levy    taxes,     and   generally   ;   but    for   such
                        limitation, the power of taxation would be presumed
                        to be for public good and would not be subject to
                        judicial review or scrutiny. Thus, considered we
                        think it would be reasonable and proper to hold that
                        restrictions freedom from which is                   guaranteed
                        by ', Article 301', , would be such restrictions as directly
                        and immediately restrict or impede the free flow or
                        movement of trade. Taxes may and do amount to
                        restrictions ; but it is only such taxes as directly and
                        immediately restrict trade that would fall within the
                        purview of ', Article 301.',  The argument that all taxes
                        should be governed by ', Article 301',  whether or not
                        their impact on trade is immediate or mediate,
                        direct or remote, adopts, in our opinion, an extreme
                        approach which cannot be upheld.\u2016

',                         66. In short, thus, in Atiabari Tea Company Ltd.

         (supra), while the narrow view was to the effect that unless a

         tax law is enacted for the purpose of making discrimination or

         giving preferential treatment, such a law would not fall within

         the purview of ', Article 301', , the majority view was that apart

         from discrimination or preferential treatment, it was the

         movement or transport part of goods, which ', Article 301',  seeks

         to make free and, hence, any such law, which, directly and
 Patna High Court CWJC No.6155 of 2016 dt.27-09-2016

',                                         48/89', 




         immediately, restrict the free flow or movement of goods would

         fall within the ambit of ', Article 301.', The third view expressed by

         Shah, J, was that it is not merely movement part of the goods,

         which ', Article 301',  seeks to make free, but also trade and

         commerce, in all its varied aspects and in all its activities, shall

         be free.
', 
', 
',                      67. In Automobile Transport (Rajasthan) Ltd.

         (supra), which is a decision of 7 Judges Bench, the correctness

         of the majority view, expressed in Atiabari Tea Company

         Ltd. (supra), came to be questioned. Having examined all the

         three     views,     as   indicated      hereinabove,     the   majority,    in

         Automobile Transport (Rajasthan) Ltd. (supra), held that

         the widest view, expressed by Shah, J, being based on purely

         taxtual interpretation of Part XIII of the Constitution of India,

         was not the correct view, for, this view ignores altogether,

         amongst others, the reality that the freedom of trade,

         commerce and intercourse in a society, regulated by law, must

         be understood in the context of working of an orderly society

         and the effect of such a view, if conceded to, would be that

         even when a. State Legislature wishes to control or regulate

         trade, commerce and intercourse in such a way as to facilitate

         its free movement, it must, nevertheless, proceed to make a

         law     under ', Article      304(b)',  and        that   no   such   Bill   can   be

         introduced or moved in the Legislature of the States without

',                                         49/89', 




         the previous sanction of the President. In other words, the

         views of Shah, J, if acceded to, would mean that even when a

         Bill seeks to impose restrictions in order to facilitate trading or

         commercial activities, such a Bill has to receive sanction of the

         President       under ', Article          304(b).',  Such   an   interpretation,

         according       to    the     majority,      in   Automobile   Transport

         (Rajasthan) Ltd. (supra), would, if accepted, result into

         stoppage of every Bill undermining thereby effective legislation,

         which may, at times, be, otherwise, urgent in nature. Pointing

         to the difficulties in accepting the views expressed by Shah, J,

         the    court, in      Automobile Transport (Rajasthan) Ltd.

         (supra), observed as follows:
', 
', 
',                                      \u201511. The most serious objection to the
                        widest view canvassed before us is that it ignores
                        altogether that in the conception of freedom of
                        trade, commerce and intercourse in a community
                        regulated by law freedom must be understood in
                        the context of the working of an orderly society. The
                        widest view proceeds on the footing that ', Article
                        301',  imposes a general restriction on legislative
                        power and grants a freedom of trade, commerce
                        and intercourse in all its series of operations, from
                        all barriers, from all restrictions, from all regulation,
                        and the only qualification that is to be found in the
                        Article is the opening clause, namely, subject to the
                        other provisions of Part XIII. This in actual practice
                        will mean that if the State Legislature wishes to
                        control or regulate trade, commerce and intercourse
 Patna High Court CWJC No.6155 of 2016 dt.27-09-2016

',                                         50/89', 




                        in such a way as to facilitate its free movement, it
                        must yet proceed to makes a law under ', Article
                        304(b)',  and no such bill can be introduced or moved
                        in the Legislature of a State without the previous
                        sanction of the President. The practical effect would
                        be to stop or delay effective legislation which may
                        be urgently necessary. Take, for example, a case
                        where in the interests of public health, it is
                        necessary to introduce urgently legislation stopping
                        trade in goods which are deleterious to health, like
                        the trade in diseased potatoes in Australia. If the
                        State Legislature wishes to introduce such a bill, it
                        must have the sanction of the President. Even such
                        legislation as imposes traffic regulations would
                        require the sanction of the President. Such an
                        interpretation would, in our opinion, seriously affect
                        the legislative power of the State Legislatures which
                        power has been held to be plenary with regard to
                        subjects in List II. The States must also have
                        revenue to carry out their administration and there
                        are several items relating to the imposition of taxes
                        in List II. The Constitution-makers must have
                        intended that under those items the States will be
                        entitled to raise revenue for their own purposes. If
                        the widest view is accepted, then there would be for
                        all practical purposes, an end of State autonomy
                        even within the fields allotted to them under the
                        distribution        of        powers   envisaged   by   our
                        Constitution. An examination of the entries in the
                        lists of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution
                        would show that there are a large number of entries
                        in the State list (List II) and the Concurrent list (List
                        III) under which a State Legislature has power to

                        make laws. Under some of these entries the State
                        Legislature may impose different kinds of taxes and
                        duties, such as property tax, sales tax, excise duty,
                        etc., and legislation in respect of anyone of these
                        items may have an indirect effect on trade and
                        commerce. Even laws other than taxation laws,
                        made under different entries in the lists referred to
                        above, may indirectly or remotely affect trade and
                        commerce. If it be held that every law made by the
                        Legislature of a State which has repercussion on
                        tariffs,    licensing,        marketing    regulations,     price
                        control, etc., must have the previous sanction of the
                        President, then the Constitution in so far as it gives
                        plenary power to the States and State Legislatures
                        in    the     fields    allocated    to    them    would      be
                        meaningless. In our view the concept of freedom of
                        trade,      commerce          and   intercourse     postulated
                        by ', Article 301',  must be understood in the context of
                        an orderly society and as part of a Constitution
                        which envisages a distribution of powers between
                        the States and the Union, and if so understood, the
                        concept must recognize the need and the legitimacy
                        of some degree of regulatory control, whether by
                        the Union or the States. this is irrespective of the
                        restrictions imposed by the other Articles in Part
                        XIII of the Constitution. We are, therefore, unable
                        to    accept      the     widest    view    as    the     correct
                        interpretation of the relevant articles in Part XIII of

',                      68. As regards the narrow view expressed by the

         learned Chief Justice, in Atiabari Tea Company Ltd. (supra),

         which was to the effect that taxing laws were governed by the
 Patna High Court CWJC No.6155 of 2016 dt.27-09-2016

         provisions of Part XII and except when a tax law is made

         under ', Article 304(a', ), ', Article 301',  did not come into play or, in

         other words, none of the provisions of Part XIII, except ', Article

         304(a', ), extended to taxing laws, it may be pointed out that the

         majority,      in    Automobile          Transport   (Rajasthan)   Ltd.
', 
',          (supra), did not accept this view ; rather, accepting the

         majority views expressed in Atiabari Tea Company Ltd.

         (supra), the majority, in Automobile Transport (Rajasthan)

         Ltd. (supra), held thus, "It would appear from what we have

         stated above that this interpretation consists of two main

         parts: one part is that taxation simpliciter is not within the

         terms of ', Article 301',  and the second part is that ', Article

         301',  must take colour from the provisions of ', Article 303',  which,

         it is said, is restricted to legislation with respect to entries

         relating to trade and commerce in any of the lists in the

         Seventh Schedule. In Atiabari Tea Co. Case [1961] 1. S.C.R.

         809 this Court deal with the correctness or otherwise of this

         narrow interpretation and by the majority decision held against

         it. The majority judgment in the Atiabari Tea Co. Case (1961) 1

         S.C.R. 809, deals, with the arguments advanced in support of

         the interpretation in detail and as we are substantially in

         agreement with the reason given in that judgment, we do not

         think that any useful purpose would be served by repeating

         them. It is enough to point out that though the power of

         levying tax is essentially for the very existence of government,
 Patna High Court CWJC No.6155 of 2016 dt.27-09-2016

',                                         53/89', 




         its exercise may be controlled by constitutional provisions

         made in that behalf. It cannot be laid down as a general

         proposition that the power to tax is outside the purview of any

         constitutional limitations. We have carefully examined the

         provisions in Part XII of the Constitution and are unable to

         agree that those provisions exhaust all the limitations on the

         power to impose a tax. The effect of ', Article 265',  was considered

         in the majority decision and it was pointed out that the power

         of taxation under our Constitution was subject to the condition

         that no tax shall be levied or collected except by authority of

         law. ', Article 245',  which deals with the extent of laws made by

         Parliament and by the Legislatures of States expressly states

         that the power of Parliament and of the State Legislatures to

         make laws is, 'subject to the provisions of this Constitution'.

         The expression subject to the provisions of this Constitution" is

         surely wide enough to take in the provisions of both Part XII

         and Part XIII. In view of the provisions of ', Article, 245', , we find

         it difficult to accept the argument that the restrictions in Part

         XIII of the Constitution do not apply to taxation laws. As to the

         argument that ', Article 301',  must take colour from ', Article 303', ,

         we are unable to accept as correct the argument that the

         provisions      of ', Article     303',  must      delimit   the   general   terms

         of ', Article 301.',  It seems to us that so far as Parliament is

         concerned, ', Article 303(1)', carves out an exception from the

         relaxation given in favour of Parliament by ', Article 302 ;',  the
 Patna High Court CWJC No.6155 of 2016 dt.27-09-2016

',                                         54/89', 




         relaxation given by ', Article 302',  is itself in the nature of an

         exception to the general terms of ', Article 301.',  It would be

         against the ordinary canons of construction to treat an

         exception or proviso as having such a repercussion on the

         interpretation of the main enactment so as to exclude from it

         by implication what clearly falls within its express terms.


',                      69. Having, thus, agreed with the views expressed by

         the majority, in Atiabari Tea Company Ltd. (supra), the 7

         Judges Bench, in Automobile Transport (Rajasthan) Ltd.

         (supra), further held that regulatory measures, which do not

         impede the freedom of trade, commerce and intercourse, and

         compensatory taxes for use of the trading facilities are not hit

         by ', Article 301', , for, such regulatory measures or compensatory

         taxes, instead of hampering trade, commerce and intercourse,

         facilitate them. In short, in the opinion of the majority, in

         Automobile Transport (Rajasthan) Ltd. (supra), regulatory

         measures, which do not impede freedom of trade, commerce

         and     intercourse,        are     not        hit   by ', Article   301',  nor   can

         compensatory taxes, which are imposed for providing trading

         facilities to the traders, as a class, be said to be violative

         of ', Article 301.',  The majority view so expressed, in Automobile

         Transport (Rajasthan) Ltd. (supra), run as under:


',                                     \u201514.        After     carefully    considering   the
                        arguments advanced before us we have come to the
                        conclusion that the narrow interpretation canvassed
 Patna High Court CWJC No.6155 of 2016 dt.27-09-2016

',                                         55/89', 




                        for on behalf of the majority of the State cannot be
                        accepted, namely ; that the relevant articles in Part
                        XIII apply only to legislation in respect of the
                        entries relating to trade and commerce in any of the
                        lists of the Seventh Schedule. But wee must advert
                        here to one exception which we have already
                        indicated in an earlier part of this judgment. Such
                        regulatory measures as do not impede the freedom
                        of     trade,      commerce         and   intercourse   and
                        compensatory taxes for the use of trading facilities
                        are not hit by the freedom declared by Article
',                         301. They are excluded from the purview of the
                        provision of Part XIII of the Constitution for the
                        simple reason that they do not hamper trade,
                        commerce and intercourse but rather facilitate
                        them. We have, therefore, come to the conclusion
                        that neither the              widest interpretation nor the
                        narrow interpretation canvassed before us are
                        acceptable. The interpretation which was accepted
                        by the majority in the Atiabari Tea Co. case (1961)
',                         1. S.C.R. 809, is correct, but subject to this
                        clarification.     Regulatory       measures   or   measures
                        imposing compensatory taxes for the use of trading
                        facilities do not come within the purview of the
                        restrictions contemplated by ', Article 301',  and such
                        measures need not comply with the requirements of
                        the proviso to ', Article 304(b)',  of the Constitution.\u2016



',                      70. Having laid down the parameters of the freedom

         guaranteed under ', Article 301', , the majority examined the

         scheme of the Act, which was under challenge in Automobile
 Patna High Court CWJC No.6155 of 2016 dt.27-09-2016

         Transport (Rajasthan) Ltd. (supra) and having found that

         the tax imposed by the enactment, questioned therein, was

         compensatory in nature, it upheld the enactment. This aspect

         can be discerned from the observations made in paragraph

         Nos. 19 and 20, which run as follows:
', 
', 
',                                     \u201519. The taxes are compensatory taxes
                        which instead of hindering trade, commerce and
                        intercourse facilitate them by providing roads and
                        maintaining the roads in a good state of repairs.', 
',                         Whether a tax is compensatory or nor cannot be
                        made to depend on the preamble of the statute
                        imposing it. Nor do we think that it would be right
                        to say that a tax is not compensatory because the
                        precise or specific amount collected is not actually
                        used to providing any facilities. It is obvious that if
                        the     preamble         decided   the   matter:   then   the
                        mercantile community would be helpless and it
                        would be the easiest thing for the Legislature to
                        defeat     the     freedom     assured    by ', Article   341',  by
                        stating in the preamble that it is meant to provide
                        facilities to the tradesmen. Likewise actual user
                        would often be unknown to tradesmen and such
                        user may at some time be compensatory and at
                        others not so. It seems to us that a working test for
                        deciding whether a tax is compensatory or not is to
                        enquire whether the trades people are having the
                        use of certain facilities for the better conduct of
                        their business and paying not patently much more
                        than what is required for providing the facilities. It
                        would be impossible to judge the compensatory
                        nature of a tax by a meticulous test, and in the
 Patna High Court CWJC No.6155 of 2016 dt.27-09-2016

                        nature of things that cannot be done.\u2016

                                    \u201520. Nor do we think that it will make any
                        difference that the money collected from the tax is
                        not put into a separate fund so long as facilities for
                        the trades people who pay the tax are provided and
                        the expenses incurred in providing them are born
                        by the State out of whatever source it may be. In
                        the cases under our consideration the tax is based
                        on passenger capacity of commercial buses and
                        loading capacity of goods vehicles ; both have some
                        relation to the wear and tear caused to the roads
                        used     by    the      buses.    In   basing    the   taxes   on
                        passenger        capacity        or    loading   capacity,     the
                        Legislature has merely evolved a method and
                        measure of compensation demanded by the State,
                        but the taxes are still compensation and charge for
                        regulation.\u2016

         again explained by the Supreme Court, in ', Jindal Stainless

         Ltd vs State of Haryana', , (2006) 7 SCC 241, at para 32, 33,

                        restricts or prevents the trade movement between

                        Similarly, a law made by the State Legislature in
                        compliance with the conditions imposed by ', Article

                        following circumstances:

                        Parliament         under      ', Article    302', ,      in    which     case
                        Parliament can impose restrictions in public interest.
                        Although the fetter is limited enabling Parliament to
                        impose by law restrictions on the freedom of trade
                        in public interest under ', Article 302', , nonetheless, it
                        is   clarified     in     clause   (1)    of     ', Article    303',        that
                        notwithstanding anything contained in ', Article 302', ,
                        Parliament is not authorised even in public interest,
                        in the making of any law, to give preference to one
                        State over another. However, the said clarification
                        is subject to one exception and that too only in
                        favour      of     Parliament,      where        discrimination        or
                        preference is admissible to Parliament in making of
                        laws in case of scarcity. This is provided in clause
                        (2) of ', Article 303.', 
',                                     (b) As regards the State Legislatures, apart
                        from the limitation imposed by ', Article 301', , clause
                        (1) of ', Article 303',  imposes additional limitation,
                        namely, that it must not give preference or make
                        discrimination between one State or another in
                        exercise      of    its    powers       relating    to     trade      and
                        commerce under Entry 26 of List II or List III.
                        However, this limitation on the State Legislatures is
                        lifted in two cases, namely, it may impose on goods
                        imported from sister State(s) or Union Territories
                        any tax to which similar goods manufactured in its
                        own      State      are    subjected       but     not     so    as     to
                        discriminate between the imported goods and the
                        goods manufactured in the State [see clause (a) of
                        ', Article 304].',  In other words, clause (a) of Article

                        304 authorises a State Legislature to impose a non-
                        discriminatory tax on goods imported from sister
                        State(s), even though it interferes with the freedom
                        of trade and commerce guaranteed by ', Article 301.', 
                        Secondly, the ban under ', Article 303(1)',  shall stand
                        lifted even if discriminatory restrictions are imposed
                        by the State Legislature provided they fulfil the
                        following      three      conditions,       namely,      that   such
                        restrictions shall be in public interest; they shall be
                        reasonable; and lastly, they shall be subject to the
                        procurement of prior sanction of the President
                        before introduction of the Bill.
', 
', 
',                                      35. Broadly, the above analysis of the
                        scheme of Articles 301 to 304 shows that ', Article
                        304',  relates to the State Legislature while ', Article
                        302',  relates to Parliament in the matter of lifting of
                        limitation, which, as stated above, flows from the
                        freedom of trade and commerce guaranteed under
                        ', Article 301.',  ', Article 304',  also confers upon the State
                        Legislature power to lift the limitations imposed on
                        it by ', Article 301',  and clause (1) of ', Article 303.',  This
                        aspect is important because the doctrine of \u2015direct
                        and     immediate        effect\u2016      which      is   mentioned     in
                        Atiabari Tea Co. emerges from the concept of
                        \u2015limitation\u2016 embodied in ', Article 301.',  It is this
                        doctrine of direct and immediate effect which
                        constitutes       the         basis   of    the       working     test
                        propounded vide para 19 (of AIR) in Automobile
                        Transport. Therefore, whenever the law is impugned
                        as violative of ', Article 301', , the courts will have to
                        examine the effect of the operation of the impugned
                        law     on     the      inter-State        and    the    intra-State

                          movement of goods, which movement constitutes
                          an integral part of trade.\u2016

',                       72. From the aforesaid observations of the Supreme

         Court in Jindal Stainless (supra), it is clear that the State

         Legislature apart from the limitation imposed by ', Article 301', ,

         also suffers from additional limitation, which is imposed by

         clause (1) of ', Article 303', , namely, the State must not give

         preference or make discrimination between one State or

         another in exercise of its powers relating to trade and

         commerce under Entry 26 of List II or List III. However, this

         limitation on, the State Legislatures, is lifted in two cases,

         namely, it may impose on goods imported from sister State(s)

         or       Union   Territories     any     tax   to    which    similar       goods,

         manufactured in its own State, are subject to, but not so as to

         discriminate between the imported goods and the goods

         manufactured in the State. In other words, clause (a) of ', Article

         304',        authorises     a   State     Legislature    to     impose     a    non-

         discriminatory tax on goods imported from sister State(s), even

         though it interferes with the freedom of trade and commerce

         guaranteed by ', Article 301.',  Secondly, the ban, under ', Article

         303(1)',  would stand lifted even if discriminatory restrictions are

         imposed by the State Legislature provided that such provisions

         fulfil    the    following     three    conditions,    namely,     that      such

         restrictions shall be in public interest; such restrictions shall be

         reasonable; and, lastly, such restrictions shall be subject to the

         of the Bill.
', 
', 
',                      73. If we analyse the scheme of ', Article 301',  to 304 of

         Constitution of India, it will become transparent that ', Article

         301',  provides that the trade, commerce and intercourse,

         throughout India, shall be free. ', Article 302',  empowers the

         Parliament to impose restrictions on trade, commerce and

         intercourse between one State and another or within any part

         of the territory of India as may be required in public interest.

         As such, ', Article 302',  deals with imposition of restrictions on

         freedom of trade, commerce and intercourse between one

         State and another within any part of the territory of India and

         Parliament alone has been empowered by ', Article 302',  to impose

         such     restrictions      in    freedom       of   trade,   commerce        and

         intercourse as may be required in public interest.


',                      74. ', Article 303',  deals with discrimination and, in such

         cases, neither the Parliament nor the Legislature has been

         empowered to make any law authorising or giving any

         preference       to    one      State   over    another      or   making     any

         discrimination between one State and another by virtue of any

         entry relating to trade and commerce in any of the lists in the

         Seventh        Schedule.        However,      clause   (2)   of   ', Article    303', 

         empowers        the     Parliament       to   make     any   law,   giving    or

         authorizing the giving of any preference, or making, or

',                                         63/89', 




         authorizing the making of, any discrimination if it is declared by

         such law that it is necessary to do so for the purpose of dealing

         with a situation arising from scarcity of goods in any part of the

         territory of India. As such, while making any discrimination

         between one State and another or giving preference to one

         State over another, Parliament alone can make such a law only

         when it is necessary to do so for the purpose dealing with a

         situation arising out of scarcity of goods in any part of the

         territory of India. No such liberty has, however, been granted

         to the State legislature under any circumstances to give

         preference       to    one    State     over   another   or   making   any

         discrimination between one State and another.


',                      75. ', Article 304',  has two parts. Whereas ', Article 304(a)', 

         deals with discrimination, 304(b) deals with restrictions. Since

         ', Article 303 (1)',  totally prohibits the State from making any

         discrimination between two States or giving preference to one

         State over another, ', Article 304(a)',  gives some relaxation to the

         State legislature by declaring that notwithstanding anything in

         ', Article 301',  or 303, the State legislature may, by law, impose

         on goods imported from other States or Union territories any

         tax to which similar goods manufactured or produced in the

         State are, subject, so, however, as not to discriminate between

         goods so imported and goods so manufactured or produced. As

         such, if the State legislature imposes on goods imported from
 Patna High Court CWJC No.6155 of 2016 dt.27-09-2016

',                                         64/89', 




         other States or Union territories, any tax to which similar

         goods, manufactured or produced in the State, are, subject, so,

         however, not to discriminate between goods so imported and

         goods so manufactured or produced within the State, the same

         will not amount to discrimination as contemplated in ', Article

         303(1)',  of the Constitution of India.
', 
', 
',                      76. However, if the State imposes any tax on the

         goods imported from other States or Union Territories to which

         similar goods manufactured or produced in the State are not

         subject to, then, the same will not be permissible inasmuch as

         the same would amount to discrimination and/or giving

         preference to one State over another, which, now ', Article

         303(1)',  of the Constitution, totally stands prohibited as far as

         State legislatures are concerned. ', Article 304(b)',  deals with

         restrictions.
', 
', 
',                      77.     Although       ', Article   302',      empowers      only     the

         Parliament to impose such restrictions on freedom of trade,

         commerce and intercourse as may be required in public

         interest,     304     (b)   gives      certain   relaxation   to   the    State

         legislature inasmuch as ', Article 304(b)',  provides that the State

         legislature may impose such reasonable restrictions on freedom

         of trade, commerce and intercourse in view of public interest

         with a condition that no Bill or amendment for the purpose of

         imposing restrictions on the freedom of trade, commerce and

         intercourse         shall be introduced or moved in the State

         legislature without the previous sanction of the President.


',                      78.     ', Article    304(b)',         does   not,    thus,    deal    with

         discrimination between two States or giving preference to one

         State over another, which is totally prohibited by ', Article 303(1)', 

         of the Constitution subject to relaxation provided in ', Article

         304(a)',  of the Constitution. Hence, to save any law from being

         violative of ', Article 301',  of the Constitution, the fiscal State

         legislation must not be discriminatory meaning thereby it

         should not discriminate between two States or give preference

         to one State over another and, by virtue of ', Article 304(a)',  of

         the Constitution, must not impose tax on the goods imported

         from other States or Union territories, when similar goods

         manufactured or produced in the State, are not subject to such

         tax so as to discriminate between goods manufactured and

         produced within the State and also not to put restrictions on

         the movement of goods except when such restrictions are

         reasonable or in public interest subject to the condition that

         previous      assent      of   the     President    is     taken    before   any

         amendment or Bill is introduced.
', 
', 
',                      79. Although a compensatory tax may not amount to

         restriction on freedom of trade, commerce and intercourse, yet

         the same may be discriminatory if the State imposes any tax

         on the goods imported from other States, while not imposing

',                                         66/89', 




         tax on goods manufactured and produced within the State and

         thereby making a discrimination between the goods imported

         and goods manufactured and produced within the State.


',                      80. A microscopic examination of scheme of ', Article

         301',  to 304 of the Constitution of India will clearly reveal that

         the framers of our Constitution never intended that under the

         guise of imposing compensatory tax, the State can discriminate

         between goods imported from outside the State and goods

         manufactured and produced within the State by imposing a

         discriminatory tax. If that is made permissible, then, the State

         can impose taxes on goods imported from other States and

         Union territories, while not imposing such tax on the goods

         manufactured and produced within the State on the ground

         that such tax is for the purpose of providing trading facility and

         the same is compensatory in nature. If that is permitted,

         ', Article 303 (1)',  and ', 304(a)',  of the Constitution shall become

         nugatory.
', 
', 
',                      81. It needs to be further noted that ', Article 304', 

         clearly provides that in order to save a law from being not

         violative of ', Article 301',  or 303 of Constitution of India, both the

         conditions of ', Article 304(a)',  and ', 304(b)',  are required to be

         fulfilled. Whereas condition of ', Article 304(a)',  relates to ', Article

         303', , the conditions of ', Article 304(b)',  relate to ', Article 301.', 


',                      82. If a compensatory tax is imposed, which is
 Patna High Court CWJC No.6155 of 2016 dt.27-09-2016

',                                         67/89', 




         discriminatory in nature and violative of ', Article 304(a)',  of the

         Constitution, such a compensatory tax will not be sustainable,

         being     violative      of    ', Article       303(1)',    of   the     Constitution.

         Consequently, such a discriminatory compensatory tax cannot

         be saved from being declared ultra vires simply on the ground

         that the same is compensatory in nature. It is only non-

         discriminatory tax, which imposes reasonable restrictions on

         the freedom of trade, commerce and intercourse and which is

         in public interest and while imposing such tax, the Bill or

         amendment introduced in the State legislature has received the

         previous assent of the President, then, the same can be said to

         be valid.
', 
', 
',                      83. A discriminatory tax, in our                     view, even if

         compensatory in nature, cannot be said to be intra vires

         inasmuch as the same shall be violative of ', Article 303(1)',  of the

         Constitution of India. The matter can be explained from

         another angle. When even the Parliament has no power to

         discriminate between one State and another or give preference

         to one State over another except in a limited case, how the

         State legislature can be permitted to make such discrimination

         or give preference to one State over another only on the

         discriminatory taxes only on the ground that the same is

         compensatory          in    nature.          This   Court,   in   Indian     Oil

         Corporation (supra), held that after the 2006 Amendment,

         the    levy,    under      the     1993       Act, acquired the     nature    of

         compensatory tax. Though it was held that amendments

         introduced in the 1993 Act by the Act of 2001 and 2004, were

         bad, because the same were violative of ', Article 304(a)',  of the

         Constitution of India; when both the amendments were made

         without the prior assent of the President. Since the period

         involved in the Writ petition was from 2001 to 2006, the Court

         has not examined the issue as to whether the levy, in question,

         has acquired the nature of compensatory tax after the 2006

         amendment, and whether the levy can be valid, though the

         same was violative of ', Article 304(a)',  of the Constitution of India

         for being discriminatory. Hence, the decision of this Court, in

         Indian Oil Corporation (supra), shall not come in the way of

         deciding the issue raised in the present writ application.


',                      85. While examining the provisions of the 1993 Act

         and the amendment introduced by the ', Finance Act',  of 2015,

         what appears from the statement, object and reasons of 2015

         is that the Amendment of 2015 was introduced as a measure of

         augmenting the revenue of the State. Though the 1993 Act was

         enacted for the purpose of levy of tax on entry of goods into

         local area in the State of Bihar for consumption, use or sale
 Patna High Court CWJC No.6155 of 2016 dt.27-09-2016

',                                         69/89', 




         therein in exercise of powers traceable to Entry 52 of the State

         List, the fact remains that the ', Bihar VAT Act', , 2005, was

         enacted to levy tax on sale and purchase of goods in the State

         of Bihar, which is a legislation traceable to Entry 54 of the

         State List, yet the common and broad objectives of both the

         amendments appear to be to earn revenue for the State, which

         is apparent from the provisions of ', Section 7(iii)',  of the 1993

         Act, which makes provision for set off of Entry tax against the

         VAT payable on the said goods in the State.
', 
', 
',                      86. It is of immense importance to note that the

         amount of entry tax paid by an importer, while importing goods

         from the outside the State to the State of Bihar, is liable to be

         set off against the VAT payable in the State. Viewed from this

         angle, we find considerable force, in the submission made by

         Dr. Saraf, learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner, that the

         levy is a colourable exercise of powers and though entry tax is,

         now, claimed to be compensatory in nature, the legislative

         objective and scheme of the enactment is to be realize sales

         tax/VAT, in advance, inasmuch as the payment of entry tax so

         made is liable to be set off against the VAT payable inside the

         State.

', 
',                                     \u2015It is clear from the operation of ', Section 4', u"
                         that once the item brought in respect of which
                        entry tax is paid is sold in Kerala, the dealer who is
                        liable to pay sales tax need pay so much of the
                        sales tax after reducing the entry tax paid on the
                        very same item. In other words, the payment of
                        entry tax goes to reduce the petitioner's sales tax
                        liability to the extent of the amount of entry tax
                        paid. The payment of sales tax is essentially
                        governed by final determination in the form of
                        assessment and entry tax paid goes only as a credit
                        towards liability for sales tax or in other works,
                        sales tax is demanded after reducing the entry tax
                        paid by the petitioner. Therefore the entry tax
                        collected at the check-post is virtually in the form of
                        advance payment of sales tax and there is no need
                        to determine the entry tax liability in respect of
                        goods brought by a registered dealer for resale in
                        the State.\u2016

         that the levy of the entry tax on goods brought into the State

         of    Bihar,     on     account        of    e-commerce   transaction,    is

         discriminatory and violative of ', Article 304(a)',  of the Constitution

         of India compared to the goods, which are brought into the

         State of Bihar for sale or consumption in the manufacture of

         goods, it is to be noted that a set off is provided against the

         payment of entry tax against the VAT liability to ensure that

         there is only single incidence of tax. However, such set off has

         not been made available, when the goods, on the basis of

         transaction through e-commerce portal, are imported from

         outside the State to the State of Bihar for the purpose of

         personal use or consumption.
', 
', 
',                      90. On account of non-availability of set off in terms

         of the second Proviso to ', Section 3(2)',  of the 1993 Act, the

         imposition of entry tax, by way of the impugned provisions,

         leads to a higher burden of tax on such goods, which are

         brought into the State of Bihar by the petitioners for personal

         use    or    consumption         of    individual   consumer,   which    are

         transacted using e-commerce portal. The goods, purchased by

         an individual consumer into the State of Bihar using e-

         commerce portal, will be liable to suffer higher rate of tax and

         thereby becomes costlier for the consumer as compared to the

         same goods, when purchased from a local dealer in the State

         of Bihar.

',                      91.    Situated       thus,      the   artificial   distinction   and

         discrimination against the said goods, purchased through an

         e-commerce portal, arises on account of the second Proviso to

         ', Section 3(2)', , which restricts the set off of entry tax paid on

         such goods only to a dealer, who is liable to pay VAT under the

         ', Bihar VAT Act', .
', 
', 
',                      92. It is crystal clear that the second Proviso to

         ', Section 3(2)',  is not applicable to a transaction undertaken by e-

         commerce portal inasmuch as the goods, brought in by the

         petitioners, are only for personal use or consumption and not

         for being sold, when the individual consumers are not dealer

         and do not have liability under the ', Bihar VAT Act', , the payment

         of Entry tax, on such transaction will be an additional cost on

         such goods. Similar situations had been dealt with, in Indian

         Oil Corporation (supra), where, in the case of one of the

         petitioners, it was held by this Court as under :

                        2002. In these two cases, the provision of set-off in
                        the sales tax liability would not apply and in these
                        two      cases,         therefore,    the      Act   was   quite
                        discriminatory with regard to the goods imported
                        from other States. The submission of Mr. Jain
                        cannot be said to be without substance. Therefore,

                        goods were brought for resale, it has to be held that

                        imported from other States for the purpose of

                        with effect from November 5, 2001 did introduce
                        an     element          of    discrimination     against   goods
                        imported from other States that were brought to

         (supra), held that in the event the imported goods are found to

         be taxed at a higher rate than the local goods, the same will be

         discriminatory. The relevant observations, appearing, in this

                        etc. at 4% of their value. It is an admitted position

                        rice, wheat etc. was 1%. In other words, the rate of
                        entry tax on the goods in question was higher then
                        the rate of sales tax by 3%.', 

', u"                                    9. Here, it may be recalled that in M/s

                        Mills    Ltd.,     it    was     argued     that       following      the
                        amendment in the definition of 'Entry of Goods' with
                        effect from 5.11.2001 (by ", Amending Act',  10 of
                        2001), the Act had become discriminatory against
                        goods      imported       from      outside       the       State.    The
                        Advocate          General        rebutted         the        contention

                        overlooked the fact that simultaneously with the
                        amendment in the definition of 'Entry of Goods', a
                        provision was introduced (vide second proviso to
                        Sub-section 2 of Section 3) for giving credit for
                        entry tax levied and collected towards the sales tax
                        payable on the sale of those goods. He submitted
                        that the Act was provided with an internal balancing
                        mechanism that saved it from being discriminatory
                        against goods imported from other States. In that
                        case, it was pointed out that atleast in case of
                        paddy, wheat and rice, the rate of entry tax was
                        higher than the rate of sales tax with the result that
                        paddy, rice and wheat imported from outside the
                        State suffered a higher incidence of tax compared
                        to paddy, rice and wheat procured from within the
                        State.       The     Advocate          General   countered     the
                        submission by taking the stand that if for some
                        goods the rate of entry tax was higher than the rate
                        of sales tax then that might be a ground to
                        challenge the notification fixing the rate of entry tax
                        under Sub-section (i) of ", Section 3',  of the Entry tax
                        Act but on that basis, it could not be argued that
                        the    Act     was      itself   discriminatory     or   violative
                        of ', Article     304(a)',  of         the     Constitution.   It   thus
                        becomes plain and clear that in order to save the
                        Act from the vice of discrimination against paddy,
                        wheat and rice imported from outside the State, the
                        notification No. SO 32, dated 1.4.2006 fixing the
                        rate of entry tax on those goods at 4% of their
                        value must be struck down for being higher than
                        the rate of sales tax on those goods. This is another

',                      94. In the light of law, which we have discussed

         above, especially, the decisions, in Indian Oil Corporation

         (supra) and Food Corporation of India (supra), it becomes

         apparent that no set-off is available, when goods are brought

         in, on transactions of e-commerce portal, for personal use or

         consumption of individual consumer as per the second Proviso

         to ', Section 3(2)',  of the 1993 Act. Consequently, such goods will

         face a higher burden of tax and, accordingly, it will be

         discriminatory against the goods brought from other States to

         the State of Bihar. Such discrimination will directly contravene

         ', Article 304(a)',  read with ', Article 303',  of the Constitution of India.

         affected by them in the State of J & K, while the local

                        refer to the legislature of a State at all. Probably,
                        the idea was to declare affirmatively in the interest
                        of removing any doubt - that even a legislature of a

                        also given rise to a good amount of controversy,
                        which we shall refer to later, to the extent relevant
                        nature of a classification. It says that "nothing in
                        clause (1) shall prevent Parliament from making
                        any law giving, or authorising the giving of, any
                        preference or making, or authorising the making of,

                        it is necessary to do so for the purpose of dealing
                        with a situation arising from scarcity of goods in any
                        part of the territory of India". ', Article 304',  deals with
                        the power of the State legislatures. It begins with a
                        non-obstante             clause   "Notwithstanding       anything
                        in ', article 301',  or ', article 303".',  ', Article 303',  was also
                        referred to in this non-obstante clause evidently for
                        the reason that clause (1) of ', Article 303',  refers to
                        "the legislature of a State" besides referring to
                        Parliament. ', Article 304',  contains two clauses. Clause
',                         (a) states that "the legislature of a State may by
                        law -- (a) impose on goods imported from other
                        States or the Union territories any tax to which
                        similar goods manufactured or produced in that
                        State     are     subject,        so,   however,    as   not   to
                        discriminate between goods so imported and goods
                        so manufactured or produced". The wording of this
                        clause is of crucial significance. The first half of the
                        clause would make it appear at first flush that it
                        merely states the obvious: one may indeed say that
                        the power to levy tax on goods imported from other
                        States      or    Union       territories   flows   from ', Article
                        246',  read with Lists II and III in the Seventh

                        Schedule and not from this clause. That is of course
                        so, but then there is a meaning and a very
                        significant principle underlying the clauses if one
                        reads it in its entirety. The idea was not really to
                        empower the State legislatures to levy tax on goods
                        imported from other States and Union territories -
',                         that     they      are   already     empowered      by    other
                        provisions in the Constitution - but to declare that
                        power shall not be so exercised to discriminate
                        against      the    imported    goods     vis-a-   vis   locally
                        manufactured goods. The clauses though worded in
                        positive language has negative aspect. It is, in
                        truth, a provision prohibiting discrimination against
                        the imported goods. In the matter of levy of tax -
                        and this is important to bear in mind - the clause
                        tells the State Legislatures - 'tax you may the goods
                        imported from other States/Union Territories but do
                        not, in that process discriminate against them vis-a-
                        vis goods manufactured locally'. In short, the clause
                        says levy of tax on both ought to be at the same
                        rate. This was and is a ringing declaration against
                        the States creating what may be called "tax
                        barriers" - or fiscal barrier", as they may be called -
                        at or along their boundaries in the interest of
                        freedom       of    trade,    commerce      and    intercourse
                        throughout         the   territory   of   India,   guaranteed
                        by ', Article 301.',  As we shall presently point out, this
                        clause does not prevent in any manner the States
                        from encouraging or promoting the local industries
                        in such manner as they think fit so long as they do
                        not use the weapon of taxation to discriminate
                        against the imported goods vis-a-vis the locally
                        manufactured goods. To repeat, the clause bars the

                        States from creating tax barriers - or fiscal barriers,
                        as they can be called - around themselves and/or
                        insulate themselves from the remaining territories
                        of India by erecting such 'tariff walls'. Part-XIII is
                        premised upon the assumption that so long as a
                        State taxes its residents and the residents of other
                        States uniformly, there is no infringement of the
                        freedom guaranteed by ", Article 301;',  no State would
                        tax its people at a higher level merely with a view
                        to tax the people of other States at that level. And it
                        is this clause which has a crucial bearing on this
                        case. Now coming to clause (b), it empowers the
                        legislature of the State to make a law and "impose
                        such reasonable restrictions on the freedom of
                        trade, commerce or intercourse with or within that
                        State as may be required in the public interest;
                        provided       that     no     Dill   or   amendment        for   the
                        purposes of clause (b) shall be introduced or moved
                        in the Legislature of a State without the previous
                        sanction of the President". (This proviso has, of
                        course, to be read along with ', Article 255',  which says
                        that if the Act receives the assent of the Presidents
                        the     non-compliance            with     the   requirement       of
                        obtaining the previous sanction to the introduction
                        of the Bill is cured.) Though in appearance this
                        clause      reads       like     conferring      on   the     State
                        Legislatures a power akin to the power conferred
                        upon the Parliament by ', Article 302', , there are
                        certain distinctions. Firstly, while ', Article 302', , does
                        not use the expression "reasonable" before the
                        word "restrictions," this clause does. Secondly, this
                        power can be exercised by the State Legislature
                        only with the "previous sanction" of the President-

                        which means the Union Ministry, or with the assent
                        of the President, as explained above. It is probably
                        our history which impelled the founding fathers to
                        lay store by the Central Government in the matter
                        of imposing restrictions, or reasonable restrictions,
                        as the case may be on the freedom guaranteed, it is
                        worthy of notice, is "throughout the territory of
                        India" and not merely between the States as such;
                        the emphasis is upon the oneness of the territory of
                        India. Part-XIII starts with this concept of oneness
                        but then it provides exceptions to that rule, as
                        stated above, to meet certain emerging situations.
                        As a matter of fact, it can well be said that clause
',                         (a) of ', Article 304',  is not really an exception to ', Article
                        301', ,     notwithstanding        the   non-obstante    clause
                        in ', Article 304',  and that it is but a re-statement of a
                        facet of the very freedom guaranteed by ', Article
                        301', , viz., power of taxation by the States. (We
                        need not refer to the other articles in Part-XIII for

                        simple cases of hostile discrimination. Therefore,
                        whether a particular tax is discriminatory within the
                        meaning of this clause, the effect of the tax on the

                        rate than is borne by indigenous goods. The tax
                        referred to in ', article 304(a)', u" is a \u2017tax on goods'.

                        has two-fold impact. First, exemptions/ concessional
                        rate of tax affect consumer choice by impacting
                        relative pricing and, thus, materially altering the
                        economic balance. It is because consumption will
                        tend to shift towards untaxed items, the prices of

                        those items and the items used to produce them
                        will increase while the prices of taxed items will
                        decrease        relatively.   Second,   such   exemptions
                        unfairly burden some businesses either within the
                        same industry or in other competing industries.

',                                     54. Therefore, the test to be applied to
                        determine whether rebate is within the realm of tax
                        defined in ', article 304(a)',  of the Constitution of India
                        so as to say that it discriminates between the two
                        class of goods: locally manufactured goods and the
                        imported goods when both the class of dealers meet
                        the conditions required to qualify for the grant of
                        rebate i.e. the use of fly-ash, is the overall effect or
                        impact of such rebate on the manufacturer.

', 
',                                     56. The above principle was re-iterated in
                        the case of ', W.B. Hosiery Association and others v.
                        State of Bihar', ; (1988) 4 SCC 134 and in the case of
                        H. Anraj v Government of Tamil Nadu; (1986) 1
                        SCC 414; wherein the effect of an exemption was
                        discussed. The issue before the Court was that the
                        locally manufactured goods within the State were
                        exempted but those manufactured in other States
                        and imported into the State were subjected to a
                        high rate of tax. The hosiery manufacturers and

                        collecting any sales tax on the sale of hosiery goods

                        Government by a notification exempted dealers
                        from sales tax of hosiery goods manufactured and
                        produced in the State of Bihar whereas levied sales
                        tax on the dealers outside the State. This Court
                        opined that from the commercial or normal point of
                        view, such a discriminatory levy of sales tax would
                        have an effect that would be bound to affect the
                        free flow of hosiery goods from outside State into
                        the      State      of    Bihar   and   would   therefore
                        violate ', article 301',  read with ', article 304(a)',  of the
                        Constitution of India.
', 
',                                     ...
', 
',                                     62. The exemption or rebate of tax is
                        therefore within the purview of taxation. In the
                        instant case, if the grant of rebate of tax by the
                        State Government under ', Section 5',  of the Act is to
                        the full amount of tax levied, then for the dealers
                        manufacturing cement using fly-ash outside the
                        State of Uttar Pradesh but selling it in Uttar
                        Pradesh, though the State Government contends
                        that the rate of tax is same for the dealers inside
                        Uttar Pradesh and outside Uttar Pradesh, but the
                        overall effect is that there is no tax levied on the
                        net turnover after deductions being made from the
                        gross turnover but, on the other hand, the dealers
                        manufacturing or producing cement using fly-ash
                        outside Uttar Pradesh are taxed at the rate of
                        12.5%. Therefore, it can be said that the rebate of
                        tax is in the nature of exemption and the instant
                        case can be decided on the basis of catena of
                        decisions of this Court where blanket exemption
                        without reasons are said to be discriminatory and

                        violating ', article 304(a)',  of the Constitution of India.



',                      97. It needs to be borne in mind that in Jaiprakash

         Associates (supra), the Supreme Court held that the object of

         ', Article 304(a)',  of the Constitution is to prevent imported goods

         being discriminated by imposing a higher tax thereon than on

         local goods. It has been held that what ', Article 304(a)',  demands

         is that the rate of taxation on local goods as well as imported

         goods must be the same. This is designed to discourage the

         State from creating the State barriers or fiscal barriers at its

         boundaries.
', 
', 
',                      98. The Supreme Court has, in no uncertain words

         clarified, in Jaiprakash Associates (supra), that the principle

         of "non-discriminatory tax", as provided in ', Article 304(a)',  of the

         Constitution of India, is a sine qua non to free movement of

         goods between nation/States in several jurisdictions and also in

         international trade and policy.
', 
', 
',                      99. Discrimination is spoken of in terms of effect and

         intention behind such discrimination. The Supreme Court has

         held, in Jaiprakash Associates (supra), that effect of a tax

         should not such that two like goods are given discriminatory

         treatment. The powers given to the State legislature are not

         unrestricted and are bound to function within limitations

         stipulated under ', Article 304(a)',  of the Constitution of India.
 Patna High Court CWJC No.6155 of 2016 dt.27-09-2016

',                                         86/89', 




',                      100. When ', Article 304(a)',  ensures only equal rate for

         incoming goods, if such goods are taxed at a higher rate or

         where they are taxed at any rate, when indigenous goods

         enjoy concessional rate of tax, ', Article 304(a)',  gets attracted.

         These are simple cases of hostile discrimination. However, one

         has to determine whether a particular tax is discriminatory or

         not within the meaning of ', Article 304(a', ), the effect of the tax,

         on the flow of goods from outside the taxing State, has to be

         taken into consideration and if the overall effect of rebate of

         tax is such that they fall within the meaning of concessional

         rates of tax so as to discriminate between imported goods and

         local goods, the same would amount to discrimination within

         the meaning of 304(a) of the Constitution. The set off, as given

         in ', Section 3(2)',  of the 1993 Act, cannot be used as a device or

         weapon so as to make a discrimination in the rate of tax by

         repaying or by allowing set off to one class of local dealers of

         the entry tax paid against the VAT payable and not allowing the

         benefit of set off to outside dealers. Such a situation squarely

         falls within the ambit of ', Article 304(a)',  of the Constitution of

         India.
', 
', 
',                      101. By giving set off under second Proviso to ', Section

         3(2)',  of the 1993 Act, a favourable treatment is given to one

         class of dealers within the State, barring the dealers, similarly

         placed outside the State, supplying goods to the State of Bihar
 Patna High Court CWJC No.6155 of 2016 dt.27-09-2016

',                                         87/89', 




         in course of inter-State trade and commerce, the effect

         whereof is that no entry tax is payable by a dealer making

         resale of the said goods inside the State, but, on the other

         hand, the dealers, who are supplying goods from outside the

         State to consumers, have to pay full entry tax as well as

         central sales tax. The net effect of the impugned provisions is

         that the cumulative burden of taxes, on goods imported from

         outside the State, is higher than the said goods produced

         within the State. This is what is known as fiscal barrier and

         such fiscal barrier has a direct and immediate effect of ensuring

         that goods are brought in from outside the State of Bihar for

         personal use or consumption on payment of CST and thereby

         making a discrimination between the dealers of one State and

         another, which is clearly violative of ', Article 304(a)',  of the

         Constitution.
', 
', 
',                      102. In the present case, respondents have not

         disputed that there is a higher burden of tax on goods brought

         in by the petitioners for individual consumers through e-

         commerce transactions; but the State has tried to defend the

         same by contending that since the levy is compensatory in

         nature, the State has the power to impose such discriminatory

         tax.
', 
', 
',                      103. As discussed in the preceding paragraphs of this

         judgment, we are unable to agree with the effect of the
 Patna High Court CWJC No.6155 of 2016 dt.27-09-2016

',                                          88/89', 




         submissions of the              learned Principal Additional Advocate

         General that in case of compensatory tax, the State has the

         power      to   resort     to    discrimination.   Even   if   the   levy   is

         compensatory          in    nature,      the   compensation     cannot      be

         demanded more from an outside dealer than a local dealer.

         There cannot be any discrimination between an outside dealer

         and a local dealer. Since the impugned provisions clearly

         discriminate between an outside dealer and local dealer by

         imposing higher burden of tax on goods supplied by outside

         dealer than a local dealer, the same is clearly hit by ', Article

         304(a)',  of the Constitution of India.
', 
', 
',                      104. Since we have already held the impugned

         provisions to be discriminatory and violative of ', Article 304(a)',  of

         the Constitution of India read with ', Article 303',  of Constitution of

         India, it is not necessary to examine the other contentions

         advanced on behalf of the petitioner.
', 
', 
',                      105. In the result and for the forgoing reasons, these

         writ petitions are allowed. The impugned provisions of the

         Bihar Finance Act, 2015 ', (Bihar Act',  9 of 2015), amending the

         Bihar Tax on Entry of Goods into Local Areas for Consumption,

         Use or ', Sale Therein Act', , 1993 and the Rules made thereunder

         and Notifications S.O. 176 & 18 both, dated 20.01.2016, are

         declared as ultra vires to the Constitution and are accordingly

         quashed. We hold that no tax can be levied on entry of goods

',                                                           89/89',

                           transactions, made on e-commerce portals, for personal use or

                           consumption of individual consumer.

                HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE CHAKRADHARI SHARAN

    JUDGMENT & ORDER
         C.A.V.
',     (Per: HONOURABLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE)
    Date: 27-09-2016

                          The   present        writ   petitions   have   been   filed

         challenging the levy and collection of entry tax on goods

         brought by the petitioners to the State of Bihar for individual

         consumers, who reside in the State of Bihar, and which are

         transacted using electronic commerce portal (E-commerce).

',                      2. The petitioners are Private Limited Company and

         are engaged in the business of providing logistics and delivery

         services to various individual buyers, who undertake purchase

         transactions through technology platform of M/s Flipkart

         Internet Private Limited ( in short "Flipkart Internet").

',                      3.         The petitioners are registered as a transporter

         within the provisions of the ', Bihar VAT Act', , 2005. In furtherance

         of their business objects, the petitioner of C.W.J.C. No.6155 of

         2016 entered into an agreement, dated 01.09.2015, and the

         petitioner of C.W.J.C. No.6202 of 2016 entered into an

         agreement, dated 01.01.2013, with M/S Flipkart Internet,

         Bangalore, for providing logistics services to the individual

         buyers, who are registered on the website of Flipkart Internet

         Pvt Ltd, viz, www.flipkart.com. Business model, adopted by the

         petitioner for Flipkart Internet, is that the online portal,

         www.flipkart.com, works as an online market place, whereby

',                                         3/89', 




         goods of various sellers, who are registered in the respective

         States, under the VAT/ ', Central Sales Tax Act',  laws, are

         displayed.
', 
',                      4. As per the specific terms of use of the said portal,

         the goods, which are purchased by the purchaser- customers,

         are meant for personal use or consumption only and are not for

         subsequent sale. The customers purchase identified goods from

         amongst the various goods displayed for sale on the portal.

         Once the identified/required/desired goods are purchased by a

         customer and the seller has received the orders from the

         customer, the petitioners undertake logistics support for such

         sellers. The sale between the concerned sellers and customers,

         in the present cases, where the goods are situated outside the

         State of Bihar, consummates prior to the petitioners\u201f taking

         delivery for providing logistics support and the appropriate CST

         is paid on such goods by the concerned seller. Package, along

         with invoice, is handed over to the petitioners for delivery

         directly to the customers at the destination addressed.

',                      5.         The State legislature of Bihar, enacted the

         Bihar Tax on Entry of Goods into Local Areas for consumption,

         Use or ', Sale Therein Act', , 1993, (hereinafter referred to as the

         "1993 Act"), with a view to levy tax on entry of goods into local

         areas for consumption, use or sale therein. The Bihar Entry of

         Goods Into Local Area Rules, 1993, (hereinafter referred to as

         the "1993 Rules") were framed to give effect to the provisions

',                                           4/89', 




         of the 1993 Act. However, the 1993 Act was declared ultra

         vires Articles 301 and 304 of the Constitution of India by the

         judgment of this Court in ', Bihar Chamber of Commerce vs.

         State of Bihar', , (1995) 97 STC 53. The said judgment of this

         Court was subsequently reversed by the Supreme Court in

         ', State of Bihar vs. Bihar Chamber of Commerce', , reported

         in (1996) 9 SCC 136, wherein it was held, by applying the

         decision, in Bhagatram vs. CST, reported in 1995 Supp (1)

         SCC      673,     that     the      levy,    under   the   1993   Act,   was

         compensatory in nature and, hence, did not violate ', Article 301', 

         of the Constitution.
', 
',                      6. The said decision of the Supreme Court, in Bihar

         Chamber of Commerce (supra), was, later on, overruled by

         the decision of the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court, in

         ', Jindal Stainless Ltd. vs. State of Haryana', , reported in

         (2006) 7 SCC 241.
', 
',                      7. By the Bihar Tax on Entry of Goods into Local Areas

         for Consumption, Use or ', Sale Therein (Amendment) Act', , 2001,

         the 1993 Act was amended. In terms of the ', Amendment Act',  of

         2001, the definition of \u2015entry of goods\u2016 was amended and the

         following proviso to ', Section 2(c)',  was inserted:

',                                     \u2015Provided that in case of such goods which
                        are liable to tax under Section 12(1) of the Bihar
                        Finance Act, 1991, entry of goods shall mean entry
                        of goods into local area from a new place outside
                        the State for consumption, use or sale therein.\u2016

',                      8.         Amendment was also made in Section 3 by

         inserting second Proviso to Section 3(2), which read as under:
', 
',                                     \u2015Provided further that where an importer of
                          scheduled goods liable to pay tax under the Act,
                          incurs tax liability, at the rate specified under
                          ', Section 13',  of the Bihar Value Added Tax Act, 2005
                          (Act 27 of 2005), by virtue of sale of imported
                          scheduled goods or sale of goods manufactured by
                          consuming such imported scheduled goods, his tax
                          liability under the ', Bihar Value Added Tax Act', , 2005
                          (Act 27 of 2005) shall stand reduced to the extent
                          of tax paid under the Act.\u2016

',                           9. With the insertion of the second Proviso to

         ', Section 3(2)',  of the 1993 Act, the taxable liability of a person

         on a scheduled goods imported in the State of Bihar, shall

         stand reduced to the extent of tax paid under the Act.', 

',                           10. The 1993 Act was further amended by the Bihar

         Tax on Entry of Goods Into Local Areas for Consumption, Use

         or ', Sale Therein (Amendment) Act', , 2003. By this amendment,

         the maximum rate of entry tax was revised from 5% to 20%

         and a number of other goods were added to the Schedule of

         the 1993 Act. Further, by another amending Act, namely, Bihar

         Tax on Entry of Goods Into Local Areas for Consumption, Use

         or Sale Therein (Amendment and ', Validation) Act', , 2003, an

         explanation has been added. This Explanation to the definition

         of \u2015entry of goods\u2016, goods, coming from outside the territory of

         India, were also brought within the purview of the Act. Both

         the aforesaid amendments of 2003 were made without prior

         sanction of the President of India.', 

',                      11. By the Bihar Finance Act of 2006, the 1993 Act

         was, again, amended by insertion of a proviso to ', Section 3(2)', ,

         which stipulated that the facility of adjustment towards sales

         tax would not be available on goods that were exempted from

         payment of sales tax in terms of any notification issued under

         Section 7(3) of the Bihar Finance Act, 1981. The said proviso

         was inserted retrospectively with effect from 25.02.1993. The

         proviso, as inserted by the Bihar Finance Act, 2006, reads, as

         under:
', 
',                                     \u2015Provided also that if the sale of such
                        scheduled goods is exempted from tax under any
                        notification issued under sub-section (3) of Section
                        7 of the Bihar Finance Act, 1981, reduction of his
                        liability under the Bihar Finance Act, 1981 as
                        provided       in      this   section   or   any   notification
                        thereunder, issued shall not be made.\u2016

',                      12. In the same year, i.e., in 2006, pursuant to the

         decision of the Supreme Court, in Jindal Stainless (supra),

         Bihar Tax on Entry of Goods into Local Areas for Consumption,

         Use or ', Sale Therein (Amendment) Act', , 2006, underwent

         various amendments in the 1993 Act including amendments to

         the second Proviso to ', Section 3(2)',  extending the adjustments

         of entry tax against also the sales tax liability to the sale of

         manufactured goods by consuming the imported scheduled

         goods.', 

',                      13. The amendments, so made by the 2001 Act, 2003

         Act and 2006 Act, were challenged before this Court in ', Indian

         Oil Corporation Limited vs. State of Bihar', , [2007] 10 VST

         140 (Patna), and this Court, upon considering the changes

         made to the 1993 Act by way of the aforesaid amendments,

         held that the parent 1993 Act, before its amendment, was not

         compensatory in character and was, therefore, violative of

         ', Article 301',  of the Constitution. The Court, however, held that

         the Act was nevertheless saved by virtue of ', Article 304(b)',  of

         the Constitution and the decision, in Bihar Chamber of

         Commerce (supra), to that extent, remains subsisting till date.

         The Court further held that the ', Amendment Act', s 10 of 2001

         and 9 of 2003 were bad, because of being violative of ', Article

         304(a)',  of the Constitution and, further, that amendments had

         been made without the previous sanction of the President. It

         was also held that the introduction of imported goods, within

         the    definition     of   "entry     of     goods",   was    bad    for   being

         retrospective        as     also      for     want     of    the    Presidential

         sanction/assent. The Court further held that after the 2006

         amendment, the levy, under the 1993 Act, acquired the nature

         of a compensatory tax and the 1993 Act, therefore, is a valid

         piece of legislation. However, on the question as to whether

         amendments, made in the 1993 Act, were discriminatory or

         not, this Court upheld the validity only on the basis that there

         was a provision of set-off in terms of the second Proviso to

         ', Section 3(1)',  of the 1993 Act.
', 
',                      14. Fresh amendments to the 1993 Act were made by

         the Bihar Finance Act, 2015, to ensure levy of entry tax on

         goods, brought into the State of Bihar, on account of

         transactions undertaken by individual consumers through e-

         commerce. By the said ', Finance Act',  of 2015, the definition of

         "dealer", under the 1993 Act, has been substituted as under:

', u"                                    \u2015(b)      \u2017Dealer'    means        any   person   who,

',                      16.        Apart from the above, the earlier applicability

         of the 1993 Act only to transactions above Rs. 25,000/- has

         been changed making the Act applicable to transactions with

         value above Rs. 1,000/-. To give effect to the amendments

         made in the 1993 Act, changes were made, in exercise of

         powers under ', Section 9(1)',  of the 1993 Act, to the 1993 Rules

         by S.O. No. 169, dated 21.07.2015. Again, vide Notifications

         were added to the existing Schedule of 1993 Act as well as rate

         of entry tax was revised in certain cases.
', 
',                      17. It is the case of the present petitioners that by the

         amendments aforesaid, entry tax, on the various goods

         imported by the petitioners, has been imposed at a rate higher

         than the rate of sales tax under the ', Bihar VAT Act', , 2005.

',                      18. The aforesaid amendments made to the 1993 Act

         as well as 1993 Rules have been put to challenge in the

         present writ application contending the same to be ultra vires

         and illegal being violative of Articles 14, 301 and 304(a) of the

         Constitution.
', 
',                      19. We have heard Dr. Ashok Saraf, learned Senior

         Counsel assisted by Mr. T. Gulati and Mr. S. Chetia on behalf of

         the    petitioners,      and     Mr.    Lalit   Kishore,   learned   Principal

         Additional Advocate General, appearing on behalf of the

         respondents.
', 
',                      20. Contending that the impugned provisions of the

         1993 Act, as amended by the ', Amendment Act',  of 2015, are

         discriminatory against goods, which are brought in by the

         petitioners for personal use or consumption of individual

         consumers, Dr. Saraf submits that the impugned provisions

         create a tax or a fiscal barrier on such goods, which are

         brought in on account of an inter-State sale transaction and on

         which full rate of Central Sales Tax (in short, \u201eCST\u201f) is being

         paid. The impugned levy of entry tax on the goods brought into

         the State of Bihar, contends Dr. Saraf, is a colorable exercise of

         power by the State of Bihar to levy sales tax on goods brought

         into the State of Bihar on account of e-commerce transactions.

         It is submitted by Dr. Saraf that the impugned levy, in pith and

         substance, being sales tax/VAT, in the garb of levy of entry

         tax, violates ', Article 286',  of the Constitution.
 Patna High Court CWJC No.6155 of 2016 dt.27-09-2016

',                                         14/89', 




',                      21. Referring to the definition of "entry of goods"

         given under ', Section 2(c)',  of the 1993 Act and the charging

         provisions of ', Section 3',  of the said Act, Dr. Saraf submits that

         where goods are exigible to tax in terms of sales tax law in the

         State of Bihar, i.e., the ', Bihar VAT Act', , 2005, entry for the

         purpose of levy of entry tax would be only when the goods are

         coming from outside the State of Bihar and, in such cases,

         where the goods move from one local area to another local

         area, the same is not liable to entry tax. This apart, contends

         Dr. Saraf, that if VAT is paid on the goods brought in from

         outside the State of Bihar under the ', Bihar VAT Act', , 2005, no

         entry tax is payable inasmuch as the payment of entry tax is

         liable to be set off against the VAT liability on such goods.

         Further, no entry tax is levied on goods, which are exempted

         from payment of VAT in terms of the third Proviso to ', Section

         3(2)',  of the 1993 Act.
', 
',                      22. Coupled with the above, Dr. Saraf submits that

         the impugned levy of entry tax, in pith and substance, is a tax

         on goods, which are brought into the State of Bihar on account

         of inter-State sale transactions on which the State of Bihar

         cannot levy VAT inasmuch as wherever VAT is leviable, there is

         set off against the VAT so payable. The State of Bihar, submits

         Dr. Saraf, realizing the limitation imposed on it by ', Article

         286(1)(a)',  of Constitution of India, which prohibits the State

         from taxing inter-State sale transactions has evolved a novel

',                                         15/89', 




         way of contravening ', Article 286(1)(a)',  of Constitution by

         selectively taxing inter-State transactions of sale in the garb of

         entry tax.
', 
',                      23. It is submitted by the learned Senior Counsel, Dr.

         Saraf, that in terms of ', Article 286(1)(a', ), the State does not

         have the legislative competence to impose tax on sale or

         purchase of goods, when sale or purchase takes place outside

         the State; whereas, the impugned proviso, in pith and

         substance, seeks to levy tax on the sale transactions, which

         stand already concluded outside the State, and the movement

         of goods, in the State of Bihar, is only for personal use or

         consumption for individual consumers.
', 
',                      24. In support of his above submissions, Dr. Saraf,

         places reliance on the decision of the Gauhati High Court, in

         ', ITC Ltd vs. State of Assam', , (2007) 9 VST 250.                It is

         further submitted by Dr. Saraf that the impugned levy of entry

         tax on goods brought by the petitioners to the State of Bihar,

         for individual consumer on account of e-commerce transaction,

         is discriminatory and thereby violative of ', Article 14', , 19(1)(g)', 

         and ', 304(a)',  of the Constitution of India.
', 
',                      25. It is further submitted by Dr. Saraf that the

         impugned levy of entry tax on goods, brought into the State of

         Bihar by the petitioners on account of an e-commerce

         transactions, is discriminatory against such goods violating

         ', Article 304 (a)',  of the Constitution of India. In so far as other
 Patna High Court CWJC No.6155 of 2016 dt.27-09-2016

',                                         16/89', 




         goods, which are brought into the State of Bihar, and which are

         for further resale or for consumption in the manufacture of

         goods, a set off/reduction of VAT is provided against the

         payment of entry tax to ensure that there is only a single

         incidence of tax. The effect thereof, submits Dr. Saraf, is that if

         the CST paid goods are not sold, but are used for personal

         consumption, the cumulative tax burden on such goods is

         much higher.
', 
',                      26. In support of his plea that              the    impugned

         provisions providing for levy of entry tax on the goods brought

         into the State of Bihar, on account of e-commerce transaction,

         is discriminatory, Dr. Saraf has tried to explain the same by

         four different situations by giving following examples:

        submits that on account of non-availability of set off in terms of

        proviso to ', Section 3(2)', , the imposition of entry tax, by way of

        impugned provisions, leads to a higher tax burden on such
 Patna High Court CWJC No.6155 of 2016 dt.27-09-2016

',                                         20/89', 




        goods, which are brought into the State of Bihar by the

        petitioner      for   personal      use       or   consumption    of   individual

        consumers and which are transacted using an e-commerce

        portal. Therefore, the levy of entry tax, on the goods so brought

        into the State of Bihar by the petitioners, acts as a tax or fiscal

        barrier on the inter-State movement of such goods and is also

        discriminatory        against      such       goods.   It   has   been   further

        submitted that on account of levy, introduced by impugned

        amendment made in the 1993 Act, goods, purchased by an

        individual consumer, when bought from any seller outside the

        State of Bihar using an e-commerce portal, will be liable to

        suffer a higher rate of tax and thereby become costlier for the

        consumer as compared to the same goods, when purchased

        from a local dealer in the State of Bihar.
', 
',                      29. With regard to the above, Dr. Saraf submits that

         the artificial distinction and discrimination against the said

         goods purchased through an e-commerce portal arises on

         account of the second Proviso to ', Section 3(2)', , which restricts

         the set off of entry tax paid on such goods only to a dealer,

         who is liable to pay VAT under the ', Bihar VAT Act', , 2005. In

         respect of the aforesaid submissions, reliance has been placed

         on the decisions of this Court in Indian Oil Corporation

         Limited (supra) and ', Food Corporation of India vs. State of

         Bihar', , reported in (2008) 2 PLJR 69.
', 
',                      30. It is submitted by Dr. Saraf that in Indian Oil

         Corporation Limited (supra), this Court held that the Act was

         saved from being held discriminatory against goods, which are

         brought in on account of an inter-State transactions only on

         account of the proviso to ', Section 3',  (2), which ensured that the

         goods from other States are given similar tax treatment as that

         of locally manufactured/ sold goods.
', 
',                      31. However, in the present case, submits Dr. Saraf,

         the said second Proviso to ', Section 3(2)',  is not applicable to the

         transaction undertaken through e-commerce portal inasmuch

         as the goods, which are brought in by the petitioners, are only

         for personal use or consumption and not for being sold. Where

         the individual consumer are not \u201edealers\u201f and do not have

         liability under the ', Bihar VAT Act', , 2005, the payment of entry

         tax, on such transactions, will be an additional cost on such

         goods.
', 
',                      32. It is submitted by Dr. Saraf in Indian Oil

         Corporation Limited (supra), this Court held the amendment

         to the 1993 Act as discriminatory in the case of a petitioner,

         when the set off was not made applicable. Similarly, in Food

         Corporation of India (supra), the Court struck down the

         notification, whereby entry tax was imposed at a rate higher

         than the rate of sales tax on those goods. Reliance was also

         placed by Dr. Saraf on the decision of the Supreme Court in

         State of U.P. Vs. Jaiprakash Associates Ltd, reported in

         (2014) 4 SCC 17, wherein the notifications, under the Uttar

         Pradesh Trade Tax Act, 1948, granting rebate of tax on goods

         manufactured, in the State of Uttar Pradesh, were challenged

         on the ground of being discriminatory against goods imported

         from neighbouring States and violating ', Article 301',  and ', 304(a).', 

         Placing reliance on the aforesaid decision of the Supreme

         Court, in Jaiprakash Associates (supra), it is submitted that

         set off, as granted by proviso to ', Section 3(2)',  of the 1993 Act,

         is in the nature of a rebate.
', 
',                      33. Relying on the decision of the Supreme Court in

         Jaiprakash Associates (supra), it is submitted by Dr. Saraf

         that granting of set off of entry tax against VAT, payable under

         the ', Bihar VAT Act', , 2005, is only applicable, when the goods are

         imported from outside the State for the purpose of resale

         within the State. No such set off is available, when goods are

         imported from outside the State for the purpose of personal

         use or consumption and, as such, the grant of set off, which is

         in the nature of rebate or exemption, discriminates between

         the goods, which are imported for the purpose of resale, and

         the goods, which are imported for the purpose of personal use

         or consumption inasmuch as the goods, which are imported

         from outside the State for the purpose of use or consumption,

         has to bear the burden of the CST as well as entry tax,

         whereas the goods, which are imported from outside the State

         for the purpose of resale, do not have to bear the burden of

         entry tax and, as such, the goods, brought in for personal use

',                                         23/89', 




         or consumption, has to bear higher burden of tax.

',                      34. It is, therefore, submitted by Dr. Saraf that when

         a dealer, who makes a sale of goods from outside the State to

         a consumer in the State of Bihar, the total burden of tax on

         him is much higher than a dealer, who makes a sale, within the

         State, to a consumer. This clearly violates ', Article 304 (a)',  of the

         Constitution of India; so contends Dr. Saraf.

',                      35. It is also submitted that the impugned levy of

         entry tax is also discriminatory and unreasonable being

         violative of ', Article 14',  and ', 19(1)(g)',  of the Constitution. It is

         submitted, in this regard, that it is obligatory on the part of the

         respondents to give equal treatment to locally sold goods as

         well as goods, which are purchased by the consumers, on

         account of an inter-State sale; whereas, the effect of the

         impugned provisions is that higher burden of tax is imposed

         only on such goods, which are transacted through an e-

         commerce portal and brought in by the petitioners for personal

         use    or    consumption         by    the   individual   consumers   and,

         therefore, the same is, according to Dr. Saraf, violative of

         ', Article 14',  and ', 19(1)(g)',  of the Constitution of India.

',                      36. Mr. Lalit Kishore, learned Principal Additional

         Advocate General, appearing on behalf of the respondents,

         submits that the 1993 Act has already been held to be

         compensatory and, consequently, the issue, as regards the

         validity of the 1993 Act, according to learned Principal
 Patna High Court CWJC No.6155 of 2016 dt.27-09-2016

',                                         24/89', 




         Additional Advocate General, must be taken to have already

         been decided by this Court, in Indian Oil Corporation

         (supra), and, therefore, the validity of the impugned provisions

         of the 1993 Act cannot, again, be looked into in the present

         writ petition. Learned Principal Additional Advocate General

         also submits that the impugned provisions are merely the

         machinery provision and, hence, levy of entry tax, on e-

         commerce transactions, were all along present in the 1993 Act

         prior to 2015 and this has already been upheld by this Court, in

         Indian Oil Corporation (supra). It is submitted that the levy

         of entry tax is irrespective of the fact whether the goods are

         brought into the State directly by the consumer/individual

         buyer thereof or has been imported into the State for

         subsequent sale and, therefore, contends Mr. Lalit Kishore, the

         levy cannot be treated as discriminatory on this count.

',                      37. The learned Principal Additional Advocate General

         submits that the petitioners are also part of the same trade,

         commerce and industry for which infrastructure is developed

         and maintained from the proceeds of the levy and, therefore,

         once the levy has been held to be compensatory, the

         petitioners cannot challenge the validity of the same. It is

         contended by the learned Principal Additional Advocate General

         that the levy of entry tax, even if found to be discriminatory,

         has to be upheld if the entry tax, so levied, is found to be

         compensatory and, hence, the same cannot be challenged on
 Patna High Court CWJC No.6155 of 2016 dt.27-09-2016

',                                         25/89', 




         the ground that the levy of entry tax is violative of ', Article

         304(a)',  of the Constitution of India. Permitting set off is not a

         condition precedent for upholding the validity of the levy of

         entry tax, contends learned Principal Additional Advocate

         General, because entry tax can be levied even if VAT/sales tax

         is not payable. The learned Principal Additional Advocate

         General, therefore, contends that the writ petition has got no

         merit and the same is liable to be dismissed.

',                      38. Reacting to the submissions made on behalf of the

         respondents, Dr. Ashok Saraf, learned Senior Counsel, submits

         that the decision of this Court, in Indian Oil Corporation

         (supra), has been misconstrued. It is submitted that this Court,

         in Indian Oil Corporation (supra), although held that after

         the     2006      amendment,           the   levy,   under   the   Act,   is

         compensatory, yet the question as to whether the validity of

         the levy can be upheld, even if such a compensatory Act is

         distinctly violative of ', Article 304(a)',  of the Constitution, has not

         been decided by this Court in Indian Oil Corporation (supra)

         as the period involved, in the aforesaid case, was prior to the

         year 2006.
', 
',                      39. It is also submitted by Dr. saraf that the question

         of entry tax, on transactions undertaken through e-commerce,

         and, further, colourable exercise of powers to impose sales tax,

         under the garb of entry tax, were not in issue in Indian Oil

         Corporation (supra). Dr. Saraf, learned Senior Counsel,
 Patna High Court CWJC No.6155 of 2016 dt.27-09-2016

',                                            26/89', 




         submits that it is incorrect to say that only machinery

         provisions have been brought in by the impugned amendments

         in the Act; rather, contends Dr. Saraf, substantive changes

         have been made in the 1993 Act to ensure that entry tax is

         levied on transactions of e-commerce, where goods are

         brought into the State of Bihar for personal consumption and

         use of individual buyers.
', 
',                      40. It is not disputed by the respondents, submits Dr.

         Saraf, that there was no machinery provision in the 1993 Act

         prior to the impugned amendments and, therefore, the

         impugned provisions are seeking to provide for a mechanism to

         impose entry tax on e-commerce transactions. Dr. Saraf

         further submits that the goods, brought into the State of Bihar

         for   personal       use     or     consumption,     were,   otherwise,   not

         subjected to entry tax inasmuch as there was no machinery

         provision to collect entry tax and by creating a specific

         machinery for collection of entry tax, when the goods are sold

         for personal use or consumption through the medium of e-

         commerce,         the      provisions        seek   to   create    a   blatant

         discrimination against such goods and seek to put a restrain on

         e-commerce transactions.
', 
',                      41. To reboost his submissions, Dr. Saraf points out

         that the impugned provisions are to ensure that the cumulative

         burden is higher on such goods, which have been held to be

         \u2015fiscal    barrier\u2016     by        the     Supreme   Court    in   Jaiprakash

         and direct effect of ensuring that the goods are not brought in

         from outside the State of Bihar, by resorting to e-commerce for

         personal use or consumption on payment of CST and thereby a

         preferential treatment has been accorded by the State of Bihar

         to the dealers in Bihar, which directly contravenes ', Article

         304(a)',  of the Constitution. Further, it is submitted that a gross

         discrimination has been created by selectively creating a

         compromise         of the      territories of the   States, the   Union

         territories and such other territories as may be acquired. It is in

         the backdrop of the fact that ', Article 1',  conceives India as a

         Union of States that the constitutional scheme for the conduct

         of trade, commerce and intercourse, contained in Part XIII,

         the two expressions used in ', Article 301', , namely, "throughout

         the territory of India" and "subject to the other provisions of

         the part". The use of the words "throughout the territory of

         India" shows that Part XIII conceives India as one economic

         unit. To appreciate as to why ', Article 301',  guarantees freedom

         of trade, commerce and intercourse "throughout the territory of

         India", the background in which ', Article 301',  came to be enacted

         needs to be borne in mind.

         over,     was     mainly     agricultural    based.   There   were   small

         principalities and very little quantity of goods moved from one

         area to another, because goods were, ordinarily, produced for

         consumption by the producers themselves, such as, land-

         owners and their tenants. Petty artisans, normally, produced

         very little commodities for sale. With the industrial revolution,

         expansion of industries took place, which gave rise to larger

         production of goods and this resulted in to faster movement of

         goods to distant places. The trade-barriers were, therefore,

         required to be minimized in order to avoid obstructions to the

         free movement of goods.

         Constitution conceived India as a strong economic unit, it was

         but natural for them to introduce into our Constitution a

         meaningful scheme for growth of industries so as to strengthen

         economic base of India as a whole. The makers of our

         Constitution knew that no meaningful growth of industries is

         achievable unless obstructions, in the movement of the goods,

         were, if not completely removed, be, at least, reduced as much

         as possible.

         Second World War, countries were struggling to overcome the

         disastrous consequences, which the war had brought. It was an

         age, when the people, all over the world, were struggling for

         space and everyone wanted to have greater say in the

         governance of their respective countries. British empire had

         fragmented and struggle to occupy he void created by the fall

         of the British empire had had fragmented and struggle to

         occupy the void created by the fall of the British empire

         intestified. It was in such a period of transition from colonial

         rule to a rule of self-governance that the constitution of India

         was in prepared. What our constitution-makers witnessed and

         experienced had its reflection in our Constitution. The concept

         of entry tax is a concept routed in history. Before the industrial

         revolution, the society, world over was mainly agriculture

         based, there were small principalities and very little quantity of

         goods moved from one area to another, because gods were,

         ordinarily,     produced        for    consumption   by   the   producers

         themselves, such as, land-owners and their tenants. Petty

         artisans, normally, produced very little commodities for sale.

         With the industrial revolution, industries grew and this resulted

         into faster movement of goods, which forms an integral and

         inseparable part of commerce. The situation in India was no

         different. As the makers of our Constitution conceived India as

         a strong economic unit, it was but natural for them to knit into

         the scheme of our Constitution the concept of a meaningful

         growth of industries so as strengthen economic base of India.

         This was not possible to achieve unless obstructions in the

         at least, reduced as much as possible.

         world,     particularly,       Europe        was   fragmented      into   small

         principalities having toll-barriers imposing toll taxes and these

         toll-barriers caused obstructions to the movement of goods.

         Such obstructions to the free flow of goods from one

         principality to another caused hindrance to the growth of

         industries      and     commerce        in    those   countries.    Gradually,

         therefore, these trade barriers were started being removed.

         Having witnessed the history of development of industries all

         over the world, and in order to give India strong economic

         base, the makers of our Constitution incorporated, in Part XIII,

         a specific constitutional scheme for conduct of trade, commerce

         and intercourse. It is in the backdrop of these historical

         realities that the present writ petitions have to be considered.

         and intercourse were guaranteed to be free throughout the

         territory of India, which, as ', Article 1',  reflects, consists of

         various States and Union territories.

         needs some regulations and regulatory measures, the freedom

         of trade, commerce and intercourse, too, could not have been

         left absolutely free or completely without any regulation. It is in

         this light that the words "Subject to the other provisions of this

         part", occurring in ', Article 301', , need to be read. Some of these

         aspects of our Constitutional scheme succinctly surface from

         the decision of the Constitution Bench, in ', Atiabari Tea

         Company Limited v. State of Assam',  (AIR 1961 SC 232),

         wherein the Court, at paragraph 33, observed as follows:

                        XIII there makers of the Constitution were fully
                        conscious       that    economic       unity   was    absolutely
                        essential for the stability and progress of the federal
                        policy which has been adopted by the Constitution
                        for the governance of the country. Political freedom
                        which had been won, and political unity which had
                        been accomplished by the Constitution, had to be
                        sustained       and     strengthened      by    the    bond    of
                        economic unity. It was realised that in course of
                        time different political parties believing in different
                        economic theories or ideologies may come in power
                        in the several constituent units of the Union, and
                        that may conceivably give rise to local and regional
                        pulls and pressures in economic matters. Local or
                        regional fears or apprehensions raised by local or
                        regional      problems        may      persuade       the   State

                        avoid     such     a    possibility.   Free    movement       and

                        guaranteeing the freedom of trade, commerce and
                        intercourse is not a declaration of mere platitude, or
                        the expression of a pious hope of a declaratory
                        character ; it is not also a mere statement of

                        enshrines a principle of paramount importance that

                        of the political and cultural unity of the country. In

                        considerations were may profitably refer to the

                        ascertain the width and amplitude of its scope. On a
                        careful examination of the relevant provisions of
                        Part XIII as a whole as well as the principle of

                        making the said provisions, the conclusion appears
                        to us to be inevitable that the content of freedom
                        provided for by ', article 301',  was larger than the
                        freedom contemplated by',  s. 297',  of the Constitution
                        Act of 1935, and whatever else it may or may not
                        include, it certainly includes movement of trade
                        which is of the very essence of all trade and is its
                        integral part. If the transport or the movement of
                        goods is taxed solely on the basis that the goods
                        are thus carried or transported that, in our opinion,
                        directly      affects         the        freedom   of    trade    as
                        contemplated by ', article 301.',  If the movement,

                        301',  provides that trade shall be free throughout the
                        territory of India primarily is the movement or the
                        transport part of trade must be free subject of
                        course to the limitations and exceptions provided by
                        the other articles of Part XIII. That we think is the
                        result of ', article 301',  read with the other Articles in
                        Part XIII\u2016.',

         flow of goods and that the growth of trade or commerce is not

         possible to achieve unless the movement of goods is made free

         from unreasonable fiscal barriers, ', Article 301',  seeks to ensure

         that tax shall not be imposed on movement of goods solely for

         the reason that the goods are carried to or transported through

         a given State, for, if such restrictions are not avoided, the

         freedom of trade cannot be achieved.
', 
',                      54. Addressing, therefore, the question as to whether

         tax laws are excluded from the provisions of Part XIII and

         whether tax laws are immune from the freedom guaranteed

         under ', article 301', , the Supreme Court, in Atiabari Tea

         Company Limited (supra), observed:
', 
',                                     \u201550. Thus the intrinsic evidence furnished
                        by some of the Articles of Part XIII shows that
                        taxing laws are not excluded from the operation of
                        ', article 301 ;',  which means that tax laws can and do
                        amount to restrictions freedom from which is
                        guaranteed to trade under the said Part. Does that
                        mean that all tax laws attract the provisions of Part
                        XIII whether their impact on trade or its movement
                        is direct and immediate or indirect and remote? It is
                        precisely because the words used in ', article 301',  are
                        very wide, and in a sense vague and indefinite that
                        the problem of construing them and determining
                        their exact width and scope becomes complex and
                        difficult. However ; in interpreting the provisions of
                        the Constitution we must always bear in mind that
                        the relevant provision \u2015has to be read not in vacuo
                        but as occurring in a single complex instrument in
                        which one part may throw light on another\u2016. (Vide..

                        578, 613). In construing ', article 301',  we must,
                        therefore, have regard to the general scheme of our
                        Constitution as well as the particular provisions in
                        regard to taxing laws. The construction of ', article
                        301',  should not be determined on a purely academic
                        or doctrinaire considerations ; in construing the said
                        article we must adopt a realistic approach and bear
                        in mind the essential features of the separation of
                        powers on which our constitution rests. It is a
                        federal constitution which we are interpreting, and
                        so the impact of ', article 301',  must be judged
                        accordingly.        Besides,   it   is   not   irrelevant   to
                        remember in this connection that the article we are
                        construing imposes a constitutional limitation on the
                        power of the Parliament and State Legislatures to
                        levy taxes, and generally, but for such limitation,
                        the power of taxation would be presumed to be for
                        public good and would not be subject to judicial
                        review or scrutiny. Thus, considered we think it
                        would be reasonable and proper to hold that
                        restrictions freedom from which is guaranteed by
                        ', article 301', , would be such restrictions as directly
                        and immediately restrict or impede the free flow or
                        movement of trade. Taxes may and do amount to
                        restrictions ; but it is only such taxes as directly and
                        immediately restrict trade that would fall within the
                        purview of ', article 301.',  The argument that all taxes
                        should be governed by ', article 301',  whether or not
                        their impact on trade is immediate or mediate direct
                        or remote, adopts, in our opinion, an extreme
                        approach which cannot be upheld. If the said
                        argument is accepted it would mean, for instance,

                        that even a legislative enactment prescribing the
                        minimum wages to industrial employees may fall
                        under Part XIII because in an economic sense an
                        additional wage bill may indirectly affect trade or
                        commerce. We are, therefore, satisfied that in
                        determining the limits of the width and amplitude of
                        the freedom guaranteed by ', article 301',  a rational
                        and workable test to apply would be: Does the
                        impugned           restriction    operate     directly    or
                        immediately on trade or its movement? It is in the
                        light of this test that we propose to examine the
                        validity of the Act under scrutiny in the present
                        proceedings.\u2016


',                      55. From the above observations made in Atiabari

         Tea Company Limited (supra), it is clear that the Supreme

         court answered, in the negative, the question as to whether the

         tax laws are immune from the operation of ', Article 301.',  Having

         held that tax laws were not immune from the operation of the

         ', Article 301',  or, for that matter, the constitutional scheme,

         embodied in Part XIII, the Constitution Bench, in Atiabari Tea

         Company Limited (supra), clarified that it is not all taxes, which

         will hit ', Article 301', , but only such taxes, which, directly and

         immediately, restrict trade, for, it is only direct restrictions

         causing impediments to the movement of goods that ', Article

         301',  seeks to avoid and nullify. It is in this light that the

         following      further      observations,       made   in   Atiabari    Tea

         Company Limited (supra), need to be read.

',                                     \u201651. We do not think it necessary or

',                                          39/89', 




                        expedient to consider what other laws would be
                        affected by the interpretation we are placing on
                        ', article 301',  and what other legislative entries would
                        fall under Part XIII. We propose to confine our
                        decision to the Act with which we are concerned. If
                        any other laws are similarly challenged the validity
                        of the challenge will have to be examined in the
                        light of the provisions of those laws. Our conclusion,
                        therefore, is that when ', article 301',  provides that
                        trade shall be free throughout the territory of India
                        it means that the flow of trade shall run smooth and
                        unhampered          by    any      restriction    either         at    the
                        boundaries of the States or at any other points
                        inside     the     States      themselves.       It   is    the        free
                        movement or the transport of goods from one part
                        of the country to other that is intended to be saved,
                        and if any Act imposes any direct restrictions on the
                        very movement of such goods it attracts the
                        provisions of ', article 301', , and its validity can be
                        sustained only if it satisfies the requirements of
                        ', article 302',  or ', article 304',  of Part XIII. At this stage
                        we think it is necessary to repeat that when it is
                        said that the freedom of the movement of trade
                        cannot be subject to any restrictions in the form of
                        taxes imposed on the carriage of goods or their
                        movement all that is meant is that the said
                        restrictions       can        be   imposed       by        the        State
                        Legislatures only after satisfying the requirements
                        of ', article 304(b).',  It is not as if no restrictions at all
                        can be imposed on the free movement of trade."


',                      56. What, thus, surfaces from the above discussion, is

         that ', Article 301',  guarantees freedom of trade, commerce and
 Patna High Court CWJC No.6155 of 2016 dt.27-09-2016

',                                         40/89', 




         intercourse throughout the territory of India. It is, however, not

         freedom from all laws that ', Article 301',  aims at protecting;

         rather, it guarantees freedom only from such laws, which

         restrict or impede the movement or transportation of goods or

         adversely affect the activities of trade and commerce amongst

         the States.
', 
',                      57. In effect, ', Article 301',  casts an obligation on the

         legislative power of the Parliament and the States to ensure

         that the trade, commerce and intercourse throughout India

         shall be free. ', Article 301', , therefore, refers to freedom from

         laws, which go beyond regulations, and which put restrictions

         or prevent movement beyond States or within the States, for,

         ', Article 301',  applies not only to inter-State trade, commerce and

         intercourse, but also to intra-State trade, commerce and

         intercourse.
', 
',                      58. What may, now, be pointed out is that though

         ', Article 301',  restrains both the Union Legislature and the State

         Legislatures from enacting laws including tax laws, which

         create hindrance to the freedom of trade, commerce and

         intercourse throughout India, ', Article 302',  permits the Union

         Legislature to impose, by law, such restrictions on these

         freedoms as may be required in public interest. ', Article 303', ,

         however, clarifies that neither Parliament nor the Legislature of

         States shall have the power to make any law giving or

         authorizing the making of any discrimination between one

',                                         41/89', 




         State and another by virtue of any entry relating to trade and

         commerce in any of the Lists in the Seventh Schedule. In other

         words, ', Article 303',  clarifies that even in public interest,

         Parliament is not authorized to make laws giving preference to

         one State over the other. This restriction is, however, subject

         to one exception, the exception being that the Parliament is left

         with the discretion to make laws giving preferential treatment

         or making discriminatory provisions if such laws become

         necessary for the purpose of dealing with a situation arising

         from scarcity of goods in any part of the territory of India.

',                      59.    Thus,      a   State      Legislature,   apart   from   the

         limitation imposed by ', Article 301', , has the limitation of not

         making laws to give preference or make discrimination between

         one State and another, while making laws, in exercise of its

         powers, relating to trade, commerce and intercourse. However,

         this limitation, on the State Legislature, is lifted in two cases,

         namely, that the State may, under ', Article 304(a', ), impose, on

         goods, imported from sister States or Union territories, any tax

         to which similar goods, manufactured in its own State, are

         subjected, but not so as to discriminate between the imported

         goods and the goods manufactured in the State. In other

         words, ', Article 304(a)',  authorizes State Legislature to impose

         non-discriminatory tax on goods imported from sister States

         even if such law interferes with the freedom of trade,

         commerce and intercourse guaranteed by ', Article 301.',  The ban
 Patna High Court CWJC No.6155 of 2016 dt.27-09-2016

',                                         42/89', 




         imposed,       under ', Article       303(1', ),       stands    lifted   even   when

         discriminatory restrictions are imposed by the State Legislature

         if   the     legislation      fulfils    three    conditions,       which ', Article

         304(b)', embodies,           namely,        that   such    restrictions   shall   be

         reasonable, the same shall be in public interest and, above all,

         no Bill or amendment for the purpose of Clause (b) or for

         making amendment thereto shall be introduced or moved in

         the Legislature of any State without previous sanction of the

         President. To be more precise, one can point out that even

         restrictions, which may be reasonable and are also in public

         interest, cannot be imposed on the freedom of trade and

         commerce unless prior sanction of the President has been

         obtained by the State before introduction of the Bill or before

         making the legislation.
', 
', 
',                      60. In short, while ', Article 301',  guarantees freedom of

         trade and commerce throughout India, this freedom is not

         absolute, for, in an orderly society, the conduct of trade and

         commerce cannot be left completely free from regulations.


',                      61.     Regulatory          measures,      therefore,    cannot    be

         regarded as impediments                  in the     freedom of trade and

         commerce. It is for this reason that the Constitution Bench, in

         Atiabari Tea Co. Ltd. (supra), makes it clear that though tax

         laws are not immune from ', Article 301', , all tax laws do not

         infringe ', Article 301.', 
',  Patna High Court CWJC No.6155 of 2016 dt.27-09-2016

',                                          43/89', 




',                      62. The question, which, naturally, arises is this: what

         can be these laws, which may hit ', Article 301',  or be treated as

         infringement of the guarantee given by ', Article 301?',  Since it is

         the movement part of the goods, which ', Article 301',  guarantees,

         the Supreme Court makes it clear, in Atiabari Tea Company

         Limited (supra), that only such tax laws, which, directly and

         immediately, impact the free flow of trade and commerce that

         will be impermissible under ', Article 301.',  However, a law, which

         has direct and immediate impact on the movement of goods,

         can be saved only if it falls in any of the permissible

         restrictions, which Articles 302, 303 and 304 perceive.


',                      63. It may also be noted that in Atiabari Tea

         Company Ltd. (supra), the three appellants before the

         Supreme Court were tea companies, two of whom carried on

         the trade of growing tea in Assam and the third one carried on

         its trade at Jalpaiguri. They carried their tea to Calcutta in

         order that it might be sold, in Calcutta, for consumption and

         sale outside India. Tea, produced in Jalpaiguri, had to move

         through a few miles of the territory of the State of Assam.

         Besides the tea, which was carried by railways, a substantial

         quantity of tea was also carried by road or by inland waterways

         and, as such, became liable to pay tax leviable under the

         Assam      Taxation       (on     goods      carried   by   roads   or   inland

         waterways) Act, 1954, for, this Act levied tax on certain goods,

         such as, tea, which was carried by road and inland waterways.

         The principal ground of attack on the legislation was that it

         violated the provisions of ', Article 301',  and was not saved

         by ', Article 304(b).',  It is of immense importance to note that in

         Atiabari Tea Company Ltd. (supra), three views were

         expressed. The views, expressed in Atiabari Tea Company

         Ltd. (supra), by the learned Chief Justice BP Sinha, which the

         Supreme Court, in its subsequent judgment in Automobile

         Transport (Rajasthan) Ltd. (supra), described as the narrow

         view, was that taxation simpliciter was not within the ambit of

         ', Article    301',  and       a    tax,      on   the    movement     of    goods    or

         passengers,        did    not     necessarily       connote    impediment       or

         restraint in the matter of trade and commerce. Drawing a

         distinction between laws of taxation, which are enacted for the

         purpose of general revenue, and taxation laws, which are

         enacted for the purpose of making discrimination or giving

         preference, the learned Chief Justice took the view that taxing

         statutes, enacted for the purpose of general revenue, were

         outside the purview of ', Article 301',  and it is only those laws of

         taxation, which were              made       for    the   purpose     of making

         discrimination or giving preference, which fall within the ambit

         of ', Article 301.',  The learned Chief Justice concluded these views

         in the following words:

                        provisions of Part XIII, the following propositions

                        emerge : (1) trade, commerce, and intercourse
                        throughout the territory of India are not absolutely
                        free, but are subject to certain powers of legislation
                        by Parliament or the Legislature of a State; (2) the
                        freedom declared by ', Article 301',  does not mean
                        freedom from taxation simpliciter, but does mean
                        freedom from taxation which has the effect of
                        directly impeding the free flow of trade, commerce
                        and     intercourse       ;     (3)     the    freedom   envisaged
                        in ', Article     301',  is         subject     to    non-discriminatory
                        restrictions (', Article 392', ); (4) even discriminatory or
                        preferential/legislation may be made by Parliament
                        for the purpose of dealing with an emergency like a

                        been continued, except in so far as the President

         view as expressed by Shah, J, and described, in Automobile

         Transport (Rajasthan) Ltd. (supra), as the widest view was

         that    the    freedom,       contemplated             under ', Article    301', ,   was

         freedom of trade, commerce and intercourse in every aspect of

         all such activities, which constitute commerce and intercourse

         and not merely restrictions on the movement or transportation

         part of goods. Shah J (as his Lordship then was) expressed his

         view thus, "The guarantee of freedom of trade and commerce

         is not addressed merely against prohibitions, complete or

         partial ; it is addressed to tariffs, licensing, marketing

         regulations, price-control, nationalization, economic or social

         planning, discriminatory tariffs, compulsory appropriation of

         goods,      freezing     or    stand-still     orders    and   similar     other

         impediments         operating       directly   and      immediately   on    the

         freedom of commercial intercourse as well. Every sequence in

         the series of operations which constitutes trade or commerce is

         an act of trade or commerce and burdens or impediments

         imposed on any such step are restrictions on the freedom of

         trade or commerce and intercourse. What is guaranteed is

         freedom in its widest amplitude - freedom from prohibition,

         control, burden or impediment in commercial intercourse.

         Company Ltd. (supra), differed from what the learned Chief

         Justice had concluded and did not accept as the correct

         proposition that tax laws are governed by Part XII of the

         Constitution and were outside Part XIII. The majority did not

         also agree with the views expressed by Shah, J. Hence,

         speaking for the majority, in Atiabari Tea Company Ltd.

         (supra), Gajendragadkar, J, observed as follows:
 Patna High Court CWJC No.6155 of 2016 dt.27-09-2016

',                                         47/89', 




                                     \u2015It is a federal constitution which we are
                        interpreting, and so the impact of ', Article 301',  must
                        be judged accordingly Besides, it is not irrelevant to
                        remember in this connection that the Article we are
                        construing imposes a constitutional limitation on the
                        power of the Parliament and the State Legislatures
                        to    levy    taxes,     and   generally   ;   but    for   such
                        limitation, the power of taxation would be presumed
                        to be for public good and would not be subject to
                        judicial review or scrutiny. Thus, considered we
                        think it would be reasonable and proper to hold that
                        restrictions freedom from which is                   guaranteed
                        by ', Article 301', , would be such restrictions as directly
                        and immediately restrict or impede the free flow or
                        movement of trade. Taxes may and do amount to
                        restrictions ; but it is only such taxes as directly and
                        immediately restrict trade that would fall within the
                        purview of ', Article 301.',  The argument that all taxes
                        should be governed by ', Article 301',  whether or not
                        their impact on trade is immediate or mediate,
                        direct or remote, adopts, in our opinion, an extreme
                        approach which cannot be upheld.\u2016

',                         66. In short, thus, in Atiabari Tea Company Ltd.

         (supra), while the narrow view was to the effect that unless a

         tax law is enacted for the purpose of making discrimination or

         giving preferential treatment, such a law would not fall within

         the purview of ', Article 301', , the majority view was that apart

         from discrimination or preferential treatment, it was the

         movement or transport part of goods, which ', Article 301',  seeks

         to make free and, hence, any such law, which, directly and

         immediately, restrict the free flow or movement of goods would

         fall within the ambit of ', Article 301.', The third view expressed by

         Shah, J, was that it is not merely movement part of the goods,

         which ', Article 301',  seeks to make free, but also trade and

         commerce, in all its varied aspects and in all its activities, shall

         be free.

',                      67. In Automobile Transport (Rajasthan) Ltd.

         (supra), which is a decision of 7 Judges Bench, the correctness

         of the majority view, expressed in Atiabari Tea Company

         Ltd. (supra), came to be questioned. Having examined all the

         three     views,     as   indicated      hereinabove,     the   majority,    in

         Automobile Transport (Rajasthan) Ltd. (supra), held that

         the widest view, expressed by Shah, J, being based on purely

         taxtual interpretation of Part XIII of the Constitution of India,

         was not the correct view, for, this view ignores altogether,

         amongst others, the reality that the freedom of trade,

         commerce and intercourse in a society, regulated by law, must

         be understood in the context of working of an orderly society

         and the effect of such a view, if conceded to, would be that

         even when a. State Legislature wishes to control or regulate

         trade, commerce and intercourse in such a way as to facilitate

         its free movement, it must, nevertheless, proceed to make a

         law     under ', Article      304(b)',  and        that   no   such   Bill   can   be

         introduced or moved in the Legislature of the States without

         the previous sanction of the President. In other words, the

         views of Shah, J, if acceded to, would mean that even when a

         Bill seeks to impose restrictions in order to facilitate trading or

         commercial activities, such a Bill has to receive sanction of the

         President       under ', Article          304(b).',  Such   an   interpretation,

         according       to    the     majority,      in   Automobile   Transport

         (Rajasthan) Ltd. (supra), would, if accepted, result into

         stoppage of every Bill undermining thereby effective legislation,

         which may, at times, be, otherwise, urgent in nature. Pointing

         to the difficulties in accepting the views expressed by Shah, J,

         the    court, in      Automobile Transport (Rajasthan) Ltd.

         (supra), observed as follows:
', 
', 
',                                      \u201511. The most serious objection to the
                        widest view canvassed before us is that it ignores
                        altogether that in the conception of freedom of
                        trade, commerce and intercourse in a community
                        regulated by law freedom must be understood in
                        the context of the working of an orderly society. The
                        widest view proceeds on the footing that ', Article
                        301',  imposes a general restriction on legislative
                        power and grants a freedom of trade, commerce
                        and intercourse in all its series of operations, from
                        all barriers, from all restrictions, from all regulation,
                        and the only qualification that is to be found in the
                        Article is the opening clause, namely, subject to the
                        other provisions of Part XIII. This in actual practice
                        will mean that if the State Legislature wishes to
                        control or regulate trade, commerce and intercourse
 Patna High Court CWJC No.6155 of 2016 dt.27-09-2016

',                                         50/89', 




                        in such a way as to facilitate its free movement, it
                        must yet proceed to makes a law under ', Article
                        304(b)',  and no such bill can be introduced or moved
                        in the Legislature of a State without the previous
                        sanction of the President. The practical effect would
                        be to stop or delay effective legislation which may
                        be urgently necessary. Take, for example, a case
                        where in the interests of public health, it is
                        necessary to introduce urgently legislation stopping
                        trade in goods which are deleterious to health, like
                        the trade in diseased potatoes in Australia. If the
                        State Legislature wishes to introduce such a bill, it
                        must have the sanction of the President. Even such
                        legislation as imposes traffic regulations would
                        require the sanction of the President. Such an
                        interpretation would, in our opinion, seriously affect
                        the legislative power of the State Legislatures which
                        power has been held to be plenary with regard to
                        subjects in List II. The States must also have
                        revenue to carry out their administration and there
                        are several items relating to the imposition of taxes
                        in List II. The Constitution-makers must have
                        intended that under those items the States will be
                        entitled to raise revenue for their own purposes. If
                        the widest view is accepted, then there would be for
                        all practical purposes, an end of State autonomy
                        even within the fields allotted to them under the
                        distribution        of        powers   envisaged   by   our
                        Constitution. An examination of the entries in the
                        lists of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution
                        would show that there are a large number of entries
                        in the State list (List II) and the Concurrent list (List
                        III) under which a State Legislature has power to

',                                         51/89', 




                        make laws. Under some of these entries the State
                        Legislature may impose different kinds of taxes and
                        duties, such as property tax, sales tax, excise duty,
                        etc., and legislation in respect of anyone of these
                        items may have an indirect effect on trade and
                        commerce. Even laws other than taxation laws,
                        made under different entries in the lists referred to
                        above, may indirectly or remotely affect trade and
                        commerce. If it be held that every law made by the
                        Legislature of a State which has repercussion on
                        tariffs,    licensing,        marketing    regulations,     price
                        control, etc., must have the previous sanction of the
                        President, then the Constitution in so far as it gives
                        plenary power to the States and State Legislatures
                        in    the     fields    allocated    to    them    would      be
                        meaningless. In our view the concept of freedom of
                        trade,      commerce          and   intercourse     postulated
                        by ', Article 301',  must be understood in the context of
                        an orderly society and as part of a Constitution
                        which envisages a distribution of powers between
                        the States and the Union, and if so understood, the
                        concept must recognize the need and the legitimacy
                        of some degree of regulatory control, whether by
                        the Union or the States. this is irrespective of the
                        restrictions imposed by the other Articles in Part
                        XIII of the Constitution. We are, therefore, unable
                        to    accept      the     widest    view    as    the     correct
                        interpretation of the relevant articles in Part XIII of
                        the Constitution.\u2016

',                      68. As regards the narrow view expressed by the

         learned Chief Justice, in Atiabari Tea Company Ltd. (supra),

         which was to the effect that taxing laws were governed by the

         provisions of Part XII and except when a tax law is made

         under ', Article 304(a', ), ', Article 301',  did not come into play or, in

         other words, none of the provisions of Part XIII, except ', Article

         304(a', ), extended to taxing laws, it may be pointed out that the

         majority views expressed in Atiabari Tea Company Ltd.

         (supra), the majority, in Automobile Transport (Rajasthan)

         Ltd. (supra), held thus, "It would appear from what we have

         stated above that this interpretation consists of two main

         parts: one part is that taxation simpliciter is not within the

         terms of ', Article 301',  and the second part is that ', Article

         301',  must take colour from the provisions of ', Article 303',  which,

         it is said, is restricted to legislation with respect to entries

         relating to trade and commerce in any of the lists in the

         Seventh Schedule. In Atiabari Tea Co. Case [1961] 1. S.C.R.

         809 this Court deal with the correctness or otherwise of this

         narrow interpretation and by the majority decision held against

         it. The majority judgment in the Atiabari Tea Co. Case (1961) 1

         S.C.R. 809, deals, with the arguments advanced in support of

         the interpretation in detail and as we are substantially in

         agreement with the reason given in that judgment, we do not

         think that any useful purpose would be served by repeating

         them. It is enough to point out that though the power of

         levying tax is essentially for the very existence of government,
 Patna High Court CWJC No.6155 of 2016 dt.27-09-2016

',                                         53/89', 




         its exercise may be controlled by constitutional provisions

         made in that behalf. It cannot be laid down as a general

         proposition that the power to tax is outside the purview of any

         constitutional limitations. We have carefully examined the

         provisions in Part XII of the Constitution and are unable to

         agree that those provisions exhaust all the limitations on the

         power to impose a tax. The effect of ', Article 265',  was considered

         in the majority decision and it was pointed out that the power

         of taxation under our Constitution was subject to the condition

         that no tax shall be levied or collected except by authority of

         law. ', Article 245',  which deals with the extent of laws made by

         Parliament and by the Legislatures of States expressly states

         that the power of Parliament and of the State Legislatures to

         make laws is, 'subject to the provisions of this Constitution'.

         The expression subject to the provisions of this Constitution" is

         surely wide enough to take in the provisions of both Part XII

         and Part XIII. In view of the provisions of ', Article, 245', , we find

         it difficult to accept the argument that the restrictions in Part

         XIII of the Constitution do not apply to taxation laws. As to the

         argument that ', Article 301',  must take colour from ', Article 303', ,

         we are unable to accept as correct the argument that the

         provisions      of ', Article     303',  must      delimit   the   general   terms

         of ', Article 301.',  It seems to us that so far as Parliament is

         concerned, ', Article 303(1)', carves out an exception from the

         relaxation given in favour of Parliament by ', Article 302 ;',  the
 Patna High Court CWJC No.6155 of 2016 dt.27-09-2016

',                                         54/89', 




         relaxation given by ', Article 302',  is itself in the nature of an

         exception to the general terms of ', Article 301.',  It would be

         against the ordinary canons of construction to treat an

         exception or proviso as having such a repercussion on the

         interpretation of the main enactment so as to exclude from it

         by implication what clearly falls within its express terms.


',                      69. Having, thus, agreed with the views expressed by

         the majority, in Atiabari Tea Company Ltd. (supra), the 7

         Judges Bench, in Automobile Transport (Rajasthan) Ltd.

         (supra), further held that regulatory measures, which do not

         impede the freedom of trade, commerce and intercourse, and

         compensatory taxes for use of the trading facilities are not hit

         by ', Article 301', , for, such regulatory measures or compensatory

         taxes, instead of hampering trade, commerce and intercourse,

         facilitate them. In short, in the opinion of the majority, in

         Automobile Transport (Rajasthan) Ltd. (supra), regulatory

         measures, which do not impede freedom of trade, commerce

         and     intercourse,        are     not        hit   by ', Article   301',  nor   can

         compensatory taxes, which are imposed for providing trading

         facilities to the traders, as a class, be said to be violative

         of ', Article 301.',  The majority view so expressed, in Automobile

         Transport (Rajasthan) Ltd. (supra), run as under:


',                                     \u201514.        After     carefully    considering   the
                        arguments advanced before us we have come to the
                        conclusion that the narrow interpretation canvassed
 Patna High Court CWJC No.6155 of 2016 dt.27-09-2016

',                                         55/89', 




                        for on behalf of the majority of the State cannot be
                        accepted, namely ; that the relevant articles in Part
                        XIII apply only to legislation in respect of the
                        entries relating to trade and commerce in any of the
                        lists of the Seventh Schedule. But wee must advert
                        here to one exception which we have already
                        indicated in an earlier part of this judgment. Such
                        regulatory measures as do not impede the freedom
                        of     trade,      commerce         and   intercourse   and
                        compensatory taxes for the use of trading facilities
                        are not hit by the freedom declared by Article
',                         301. They are excluded from the purview of the
                        provision of Part XIII of the Constitution for the
                        simple reason that they do not hamper trade,
                        commerce and intercourse but rather facilitate
                        them. We have, therefore, come to the conclusion
                        that neither the              widest interpretation nor the
                        narrow interpretation canvassed before us are
                        acceptable. The interpretation which was accepted
                        by the majority in the Atiabari Tea Co. case (1961)
',                         1. S.C.R. 809, is correct, but subject to this
                        clarification.     Regulatory       measures   or   measures
                        imposing compensatory taxes for the use of trading
                        facilities do not come within the purview of the
                        restrictions contemplated by ', Article 301',  and such
                        measures need not comply with the requirements of
                        the proviso to ', Article 304(b)',  of the Constitution.\u2016



',                      70. Having laid down the parameters of the freedom

         guaranteed under ', Article 301', , the majority examined the

         scheme of the Act, which was under challenge in Automobile
 Patna High Court CWJC No.6155 of 2016 dt.27-09-2016

         Transport (Rajasthan) Ltd. (supra) and having found that

         the tax imposed by the enactment, questioned therein, was

         compensatory in nature, it upheld the enactment. This aspect

         can be discerned from the observations made in paragraph

         Nos. 19 and 20, which run as follows:
', 
', 
',                                     \u201519. The taxes are compensatory taxes
                        which instead of hindering trade, commerce and
                        intercourse facilitate them by providing roads and
                        maintaining the roads in a good state of repairs.', 
',                         Whether a tax is compensatory or nor cannot be
                        made to depend on the preamble of the statute
                        imposing it. Nor do we think that it would be right
                        to say that a tax is not compensatory because the
                        precise or specific amount collected is not actually
                        used to providing any facilities. It is obvious that if
                        the     preamble         decided   the   matter:   then   the
                        mercantile community would be helpless and it
                        would be the easiest thing for the Legislature to
                        defeat     the     freedom     assured    by ', Article   341',  by
                        stating in the preamble that it is meant to provide
                        facilities to the tradesmen. Likewise actual user
                        would often be unknown to tradesmen and such
                        user may at some time be compensatory and at
                        others not so. It seems to us that a working test for
                        deciding whether a tax is compensatory or not is to
                        enquire whether the trades people are having the
                        use of certain facilities for the better conduct of
                        their business and paying not patently much more
                        than what is required for providing the facilities. It
                        would be impossible to judge the compensatory
                        nature of a tax by a meticulous test, and in the
 Patna High Court CWJC No.6155 of 2016 dt.27-09-2016

                        nature of things that cannot be done.\u2016

                                    \u201520. Nor do we think that it will make any
                        difference that the money collected from the tax is
                        not put into a separate fund so long as facilities for
                        the trades people who pay the tax are provided and
                        the expenses incurred in providing them are born
                        by the State out of whatever source it may be. In
                        the cases under our consideration the tax is based
                        on passenger capacity of commercial buses and
                        loading capacity of goods vehicles ; both have some
                        relation to the wear and tear caused to the roads
                        used     by    the      buses.    In   basing    the   taxes   on
                        passenger        capacity        or    loading   capacity,     the
                        Legislature has merely evolved a method and
                        measure of compensation demanded by the State,
                        but the taxes are still compensation and charge for
                        regulation.\u2016

         again explained by the Supreme Court, in ', Jindal Stainless

         Ltd vs State of Haryana', , (2006) 7 SCC 241, at para 32, 33,

                        intercourse throughout India shall be free. It is not

                        on all legislative power to ensure that trade,

                        restricts or prevents the trade movement between

                        in public interest under ', Article 302', , nonetheless, it
                        is   clarified     in     clause   (1)    of     ', Article    303',        that
                        notwithstanding anything contained in ', Article 302', ,
                        Parliament is not authorised even in public interest,
                        in the making of any law, to give preference to one
                        State over another. However, the said clarification

                        preference is admissible to Parliament in making of
                        laws in case of scarcity. This is provided in clause

                        (1) of ', Article 303',  imposes additional limitation,
                        namely, that it must not give preference or make
                        discrimination between one State or another in

                        However, this limitation on the State Legislatures is
                        lifted in two cases, namely, it may impose on goods
                        imported from sister State(s) or Union Territories
                        any tax to which similar goods manufactured in its
                        own      State      are    subjected       but     not     so    as     to
                        discriminate between the imported goods and the

                        304 authorises a State Legislature to impose a non-
                        discriminatory tax on goods imported from sister
                        State(s), even though it interferes with the freedom
                        of trade and commerce guaranteed by ', Article 301.', 
                        Secondly, the ban under ', Article 303(1)',  shall stand
                        lifted even if discriminatory restrictions are imposed
                        by the State Legislature provided they fulfil the
                        following      three      conditions,       namely,      that   such
                        restrictions shall be in public interest; they shall be
                        reasonable; and lastly, they shall be subject to the
                        procurement of prior sanction of the President
                        before introduction of the Bill.
', 
', 
',                                      35. Broadly, the above analysis of the
                        scheme of Articles 301 to 304 shows that ', Article
                        304',  relates to the State Legislature while ', Article
                        302',  relates to Parliament in the matter of lifting of
                        limitation, which, as stated above, flows from the
                        freedom of trade and commerce guaranteed under
                        ', Article 301.',  ', Article 304',  also confers upon the State
                        Legislature power to lift the limitations imposed on
                        it by ', Article 301',  and clause (1) of ', Article 303.',  This
                        aspect is important because the doctrine of \u2015direct
                        and     immediate        effect\u2016      which      is   mentioned     in
                        Atiabari Tea Co. emerges from the concept of
                        \u2015limitation\u2016 embodied in ', Article 301.',  It is this
                        doctrine of direct and immediate effect which
                        constitutes       the         basis   of    the       working     test
                        propounded vide para 19 (of AIR) in Automobile
                        Transport. Therefore, whenever the law is impugned
                        as violative of ', Article 301', , the courts will have to
                        examine the effect of the operation of the impugned
                        law     on     the      inter-State        and    the    intra-State

                          movement of goods, which movement constitutes
                          an integral part of trade.\u2016

',                       72. From the aforesaid observations of the Supreme

         Court in Jindal Stainless (supra), it is clear that the State

         Legislature apart from the limitation imposed by ', Article 301', ,

         also suffers from additional limitation, which is imposed by

         clause (1) of ', Article 303', , namely, the State must not give

         preference or make discrimination between one State or

         another in exercise of its powers relating to trade and

         commerce under Entry 26 of List II or List III. However, this

         limitation on, the State Legislatures, is lifted in two cases,

         namely, it may impose on goods imported from sister State(s)

         or       Union   Territories     any     tax   to    which    similar       goods,

         manufactured in its own State, are subject to, but not so as to

         discriminate between the imported goods and the goods

         manufactured in the State. In other words, clause (a) of ', Article

         304',        authorises     a   State     Legislature    to     impose     a    non-

         discriminatory tax on goods imported from sister State(s), even

         though it interferes with the freedom of trade and commerce

         guaranteed by ', Article 301.',  Secondly, the ban, under ', Article

         303(1)',  would stand lifted even if discriminatory restrictions are

         imposed by the State Legislature provided that such provisions

         fulfil    the    following     three    conditions,    namely,     that      such

         restrictions shall be in public interest; such restrictions shall be

         reasonable; and, lastly, such restrictions shall be subject to the

         of the Bill.
', 
', 
',                      73. If we analyse the scheme of ', Article 301',  to 304 of

         Constitution of India, it will become transparent that ', Article

         301',  provides that the trade, commerce and intercourse,

         throughout India, shall be free. ', Article 302',  empowers the

         Parliament to impose restrictions on trade, commerce and

         intercourse between one State and another or within any part

         of the territory of India as may be required in public interest.

         As such, ', Article 302',  deals with imposition of restrictions on

         freedom of trade, commerce and intercourse between one

         State and another within any part of the territory of India and

         Parliament alone has been empowered by ', Article 302',  to impose

         such     restrictions      in    freedom       of   trade,   commerce        and

         intercourse as may be required in public interest.


',                      74. ', Article 303',  deals with discrimination and, in such

         cases, neither the Parliament nor the Legislature has been

         empowered to make any law authorising or giving any

         preference       to    one      State   over    another      or   making     any

         discrimination between one State and another by virtue of any

         entry relating to trade and commerce in any of the lists in the

         Seventh        Schedule.        However,      clause   (2)   of   ', Article    303', 

         empowers        the     Parliament       to   make     any   law,   giving    or

         authorizing the giving of any preference, or making, or

',                                         63/89', 




         authorizing the making of, any discrimination if it is declared by

         such law that it is necessary to do so for the purpose of dealing

         with a situation arising from scarcity of goods in any part of the

         territory of India. As such, while making any discrimination

         between one State and another or giving preference to one

         State over another, Parliament alone can make such a law only

         when it is necessary to do so for the purpose dealing with a

         situation arising out of scarcity of goods in any part of the

         territory of India. No such liberty has, however, been granted

         to the State legislature under any circumstances to give

         preference       to    one    State     over   another   or   making   any

         discrimination between one State and another.


',                      75. ', Article 304',  has two parts. Whereas ', Article 304(a)', 

         deals with discrimination, 304(b) deals with restrictions. Since

         ', Article 303 (1)',  totally prohibits the State from making any

         discrimination between two States or giving preference to one

         State over another, ', Article 304(a)',  gives some relaxation to the

         State legislature by declaring that notwithstanding anything in

         ', Article 301',  or 303, the State legislature may, by law, impose

         on goods imported from other States or Union territories any

         tax to which similar goods manufactured or produced in the

         State are, subject, so, however, as not to discriminate between

         goods so imported and goods so manufactured or produced. As

         such, if the State legislature imposes on goods imported from

',                                         64/89', 




         other States or Union territories, any tax to which similar

         goods, manufactured or produced in the State, are, subject, so,

         however, not to discriminate between goods so imported and

         goods so manufactured or produced within the State, the same

         will not amount to discrimination as contemplated in ', Article

         303(1)',  of the Constitution of India.
', 
', 
',                      76. However, if the State imposes any tax on the

         goods imported from other States or Union Territories to which

         similar goods manufactured or produced in the State are not

         subject to, then, the same will not be permissible inasmuch as

         the same would amount to discrimination and/or giving

         preference to one State over another, which, now ', Article

         303(1)',  of the Constitution, totally stands prohibited as far as

         State legislatures are concerned. ', Article 304(b)',  deals with

         restrictions.
', 
', 
',                      77.     Although       ', Article   302',      empowers      only     the

         Parliament to impose such restrictions on freedom of trade,

         commerce and intercourse as may be required in public

         interest,     304     (b)   gives      certain   relaxation   to   the    State

         legislature inasmuch as ', Article 304(b)',  provides that the State

         legislature may impose such reasonable restrictions on freedom

         of trade, commerce and intercourse in view of public interest

         with a condition that no Bill or amendment for the purpose of

         imposing restrictions on the freedom of trade, commerce and

         intercourse         shall be introduced or moved in the State

         legislature without the previous sanction of the President.


',                      78.     ', Article    304(b)',         does   not,    thus,    deal    with

         discrimination between two States or giving preference to one

         State over another, which is totally prohibited by ', Article 303(1)', 

         of the Constitution subject to relaxation provided in ', Article

         304(a)',  of the Constitution. Hence, to save any law from being

         violative of ', Article 301',  of the Constitution, the fiscal State

         legislation must not be discriminatory meaning thereby it

         should not discriminate between two States or give preference

         to one State over another and, by virtue of ', Article 304(a)',  of

         the Constitution, must not impose tax on the goods imported

         from other States or Union territories, when similar goods

         manufactured or produced in the State, are not subject to such

         tax so as to discriminate between goods manufactured and

         produced within the State and also not to put restrictions on

         the movement of goods except when such restrictions are

         reasonable or in public interest subject to the condition that

         previous      assent      of   the     President    is     taken    before   any

         amendment or Bill is introduced.
', 
', 
',                      79. Although a compensatory tax may not amount to

         restriction on freedom of trade, commerce and intercourse, yet

         the same may be discriminatory if the State imposes any tax

         on the goods imported from other States, while not imposing

         tax on goods manufactured and produced within the State and

         thereby making a discrimination between the goods imported

         and goods manufactured and produced within the State.


',                      80. A microscopic examination of scheme of ', Article

         301',  to 304 of the Constitution of India will clearly reveal that

         the framers of our Constitution never intended that under the

         guise of imposing compensatory tax, the State can discriminate

         between goods imported from outside the State and goods

         manufactured and produced within the State by imposing a

         discriminatory tax. If that is made permissible, then, the State

         can impose taxes on goods imported from other States and

         Union territories, while not imposing such tax on the goods

         manufactured and produced within the State on the ground

         that such tax is for the purpose of providing trading facility and

         the same is compensatory in nature. If that is permitted,

         ', Article 303 (1)',  and ', 304(a)',  of the Constitution shall become

         nugatory.
', 
', 
',                      81. It needs to be further noted that ', Article 304', 

         clearly provides that in order to save a law from being not

         violative of ', Article 301',  or 303 of Constitution of India, both the

         conditions of ', Article 304(a)',  and ', 304(b)',  are required to be

         fulfilled. Whereas condition of ', Article 304(a)',  relates to ', Article

         303', , the conditions of ', Article 304(b)',  relate to ', Article 301.', 


',                      82. If a compensatory tax is imposed, which is
 Patna High Court CWJC No.6155 of 2016 dt.27-09-2016

',                                         67/89', 




         discriminatory in nature and violative of ', Article 304(a)',  of the

         Constitution, such a compensatory tax will not be sustainable,

         being     violative      of    ', Article       303(1)',    of   the     Constitution.

         Consequently, such a discriminatory compensatory tax cannot

         be saved from being declared ultra vires simply on the ground

         that the same is compensatory in nature. It is only non-

         discriminatory tax, which imposes reasonable restrictions on

         the freedom of trade, commerce and intercourse and which is

         in public interest and while imposing such tax, the Bill or

         amendment introduced in the State legislature has received the

         previous assent of the President, then, the same can be said to

         be valid.
', 
', 
',                      83. A discriminatory tax, in our                     view, even if

         compensatory in nature, cannot be said to be intra vires

         inasmuch as the same shall be violative of ', Article 303(1)',  of the

         Constitution of India. The matter can be explained from

         another angle. When even the Parliament has no power to

         discriminate between one State and another or give preference

         to one State over another except in a limited case, how the

         State legislature can be permitted to make such discrimination

         or give preference to one State over another only on the

         ground that the said taxes are compensatory in nature.


',                      84. This Court, in Indian Oil Corporation (supra),

         has not decided the issue as to whether the State can impose
 Patna High Court CWJC No.6155 of 2016 dt.27-09-2016

',                                           68/89', 




         discriminatory taxes only on the ground that the same is

         compensatory          in    nature.          This   Court,   in   Indian     Oil

         Corporation (supra), held that after the 2006 Amendment,

         the    levy,    under      the     1993       Act, acquired the     nature    of

         compensatory tax. Though it was held that amendments

         introduced in the 1993 Act by the Act of 2001 and 2004, were

         bad, because the same were violative of ', Article 304(a)',  of the

         Constitution of India; when both the amendments were made

         without the prior assent of the President. Since the period

         involved in the Writ petition was from 2001 to 2006, the Court

         has not examined the issue as to whether the levy, in question,

         has acquired the nature of compensatory tax after the 2006

         amendment, and whether the levy can be valid, though the

         same was violative of ', Article 304(a)',  of the Constitution of India

         for being discriminatory. Hence, the decision of this Court, in

         Indian Oil Corporation (supra), shall not come in the way of

         deciding the issue raised in the present writ application.


',                      85. While examining the provisions of the 1993 Act

         and the amendment introduced by the ', Finance Act',  of 2015,

         what appears from the statement, object and reasons of 2015

         is that the Amendment of 2015 was introduced as a measure of

         augmenting the revenue of the State. Though the 1993 Act was

         enacted for the purpose of levy of tax on entry of goods into

         local area in the State of Bihar for consumption, use or sale
 Patna High Court CWJC No.6155 of 2016 dt.27-09-2016

',                                         69/89', 




         therein in exercise of powers traceable to Entry 52 of the State

         List, the fact remains that the ', Bihar VAT Act', , 2005, was

         enacted to levy tax on sale and purchase of goods in the State

         of Bihar, which is a legislation traceable to Entry 54 of the

         State List, yet the common and broad objectives of both the

         amendments appear to be to earn revenue for the State, which

         is apparent from the provisions of ', Section 7(iii)',  of the 1993

         Act, which makes provision for set off of Entry tax against the

         VAT payable on the said goods in the State.
', 
', 
',                      86. It is of immense importance to note that the

         amount of entry tax paid by an importer, while importing goods

         from the outside the State to the State of Bihar, is liable to be

         set off against the VAT payable in the State. Viewed from this

         angle, we find considerable force, in the submission made by

         Dr. Saraf, learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner, that the

         levy is a colourable exercise of powers and though entry tax is,

         now, claimed to be compensatory in nature, the legislative

         objective and scheme of the enactment is to be realize sales

         tax/VAT, in advance, inasmuch as the payment of entry tax so

         made is liable to be set off against the VAT payable inside the

         State.

                        liable to pay sales tax need pay so much of the
                        sales tax after reducing the entry tax paid on the
                        very same item. In other words, the payment of
                        entry tax goes to reduce the petitioner's sales tax
                        liability to the extent of the amount of entry tax
                        paid. The payment of sales tax is essentially
                        governed by final determination in the form of
                        assessment and entry tax paid goes only as a credit
                        towards liability for sales tax or in other works,
                        sales tax is demanded after reducing the entry tax
                        paid by the petitioner. Therefore the entry tax
                        collected at the check-post is virtually in the form of
                        advance payment of sales tax and there is no need
                        to determine the entry tax liability in respect of
                        goods brought by a registered dealer for resale in
                        the State.\u2016

         that the levy of the entry tax on goods brought into the State

         of    Bihar,     on     account        of    e-commerce   transaction,    is

         discriminatory and violative of ', Article 304(a)',  of the Constitution

         of India compared to the goods, which are brought into the

         State of Bihar for sale or consumption in the manufacture of

         goods, it is to be noted that a set off is provided against the

         payment of entry tax against the VAT liability to ensure that

         there is only single incidence of tax. However, such set off has

         not been made available, when the goods, on the basis of

         transaction through e-commerce portal, are imported from

         outside the State to the State of Bihar for the purpose of

         personal use or consumption.
', 
', 
',                      90. On account of non-availability of set off in terms

         of the second Proviso to ', Section 3(2)',  of the 1993 Act, the

         imposition of entry tax, by way of the impugned provisions,

         leads to a higher burden of tax on such goods, which are

         brought into the State of Bihar by the petitioners for personal

         use    or    consumption         of    individual   consumer,   which    are

         transacted using e-commerce portal. The goods, purchased by

         an individual consumer into the State of Bihar using e-

         commerce portal, will be liable to suffer higher rate of tax and

         thereby becomes costlier for the consumer as compared to the

         same goods, when purchased from a local dealer in the State

         of Bihar.

',                      91.    Situated       thus,      the   artificial   distinction   and

         discrimination against the said goods, purchased through an

         e-commerce portal, arises on account of the second Proviso to

         ', Section 3(2)', , which restricts the set off of entry tax paid on

         such goods only to a dealer, who is liable to pay VAT under the

         ', Bihar VAT Act', .
', 
', 
',                      92. It is crystal clear that the second Proviso to

         ', Section 3(2)',  is not applicable to a transaction undertaken by e-

         commerce portal inasmuch as the goods, brought in by the

         petitioners, are only for personal use or consumption and not

         for being sold, when the individual consumers are not dealer

         and do not have liability under the ', Bihar VAT Act', , the payment

         of Entry tax, on such transaction will be an additional cost on

         such goods. Similar situations had been dealt with, in Indian

         Oil Corporation (supra), where, in the case of one of the

         petitioners, it was held by this Court as under :

                        reference to goods that were brought into a local

                        2002. In these two cases, the provision of set-off in
                        the sales tax liability would not apply and in these
                        two      cases,         therefore,    the      Act   was   quite
                        discriminatory with regard to the goods imported
                        from other States. The submission of Mr. Jain
                        cannot be said to be without substance. Therefore,
                        while agreeing with the submission of the Advocate-', 
',                         General that there was no discrimination against

                        goods were brought for resale, it has to be held that
                        there was an apparent discrimination against goods
                        imported from other States for the purpose of
                        consumption or use. I., therefore,, conclude that

                        with effect from November 5, 2001 did introduce
                        an     element          of    discrimination     against   goods
                        imported from other States that were brought to

         (supra), held that in the event the imported goods are found to

         be taxed at a higher rate than the local goods, the same will be

         discriminatory. The relevant observations, appearing, in this

         regard, in Food Corporation of India (supra), read as

                        under ', Section 3A',  of the Act, the State Government
                        issued notification No. SO 34, dated 1.4.2006 by

                        fixing the rate of entry tax on paddy, rice, wheat
                        etc. at 4% of their value. It is an admitted position

                        rice, wheat etc. was 1%. In other words, the rate of
                        entry tax on the goods in question was higher then
                        the rate of sales tax by 3%.', 

', u"                                    9. Here, it may be recalled that in M/s

                        Mills    Ltd.,     it    was     argued     that       following      the
                        amendment in the definition of 'Entry of Goods' with
                        effect from 5.11.2001 (by ", Amending Act',  10 of
                        2001), the Act had become discriminatory against

                        Advocate          General        rebutted         the        contention

                        overlooked the fact that simultaneously with the
                        amendment in the definition of 'Entry of Goods', a
                        provision was introduced (vide second proviso to
                        Sub-section 2 of Section 3) for giving credit for
                        entry tax levied and collected towards the sales tax
                        payable on the sale of those goods. He submitted
                        that the Act was provided with an internal balancing
                        mechanism that saved it from being discriminatory
                        against goods imported from other States. In that
                        case, it was pointed out that atleast in case of
                        paddy, wheat and rice, the rate of entry tax was
                        higher than the rate of sales tax with the result that
                        paddy, rice and wheat imported from outside the
                        State suffered a higher incidence of tax compared
                        to paddy, rice and wheat procured from within the
                        State.       The     Advocate          General   countered     the
                        submission by taking the stand that if for some
                        goods the rate of entry tax was higher than the rate
                        of sales tax then that might be a ground to
                        challenge the notification fixing the rate of entry tax
                        under Sub-section (i) of ", Section 3',  of the Entry tax
                        Act but on that basis, it could not be argued that
                        the    Act     was      itself   discriminatory     or   violative
                        of ', Article     304(a)',  of         the     Constitution.   It   thus
                        becomes plain and clear that in order to save the
                        Act from the vice of discrimination against paddy,
                        wheat and rice imported from outside the State, the
                        notification No. SO 32, dated 1.4.2006 fixing the
                        rate of entry tax on those goods at 4% of their
                        value must be struck down for being higher than
                        the rate of sales tax on those goods. This is another
                        important ground on which this writ petition is
                        bound to succeed.

         above, especially, the decisions, in Indian Oil Corporation

         consumption of individual consumer as per the second Proviso

         to ', Section 3(2)',  of the 1993 Act. Consequently, such goods will

         face a higher burden of tax and, accordingly, it will be

         discriminatory against the goods brought from other States to

         the State of Bihar. Such discrimination will directly contravene

                        legislature of a State" when ', Article 302',  does not
                        refer to the legislature of a State at all. Probably,
                        the idea was to declare affirmatively in the interest
                        of removing any doubt - that even a legislature of a
                        State shall not have the power to make any law
                        giving or authorizing the giving of any preference to
                        one estate over another or making or authorising
                        the making of any discrimination between one state
                        and another by virtue of their power to make a law

                        commerce in the Seventh schedule. Further, the

                        to trade and commerce of any of the Lists in the

                        also given rise to a good amount of controversy,
                        which we shall refer to later, to the extent relevant
                        nature of a classification. It says that "nothing in
                        clause (1) shall prevent Parliament from making
                        any law giving, or authorising the giving of, any
                        preference or making, or authorising the making of,
                        any discrimination if it is declared by such law that
                        it is necessary to do so for the purpose of dealing
                        with a situation arising from scarcity of goods in any
                        part of the territory of India". ', Article 304',  deals with
                        the power of the State legislatures. It begins with a
                        non-obstante             clause   "Notwithstanding       anything
                        in ', article 301',  or ', article 303".',  ', Article 303',  was also
                        referred to in this non-obstante clause evidently for
                        the reason that clause (1) of ', Article 303',  refers to
                        "the legislature of a State" besides referring to
                        Parliament. ', Article 304',  contains two clauses. Clause
',                         (a) states that "the legislature of a State may by
                        law -- (a) impose on goods imported from other
                        States or the Union territories any tax to which
                        similar goods manufactured or produced in that
                        State     are     subject,        so,   however,    as   not   to
                        discriminate between goods so imported and goods
                        so manufactured or produced". The wording of this
                        clause is of crucial significance. The first half of the
                        clause would make it appear at first flush that it
                        merely states the obvious: one may indeed say that
                        the power to levy tax on goods imported from other
                        States      or    Union       territories   flows   from ', Article
                        246',  read with Lists II and III in the Seventh

                        Schedule and not from this clause. That is of course
                        so, but then there is a meaning and a very
                        significant principle underlying the clauses if one
                        reads it in its entirety. The idea was not really to
                        empower the State legislatures to levy tax on goods
                        imported from other States and Union territories -
',                         that     they      are   already     empowered      by    other
                        provisions in the Constitution - but to declare that
                        power shall not be so exercised to discriminate
                        against      the    imported    goods     vis-a-   vis   locally
                        manufactured goods. The clauses though worded in
                        positive language has negative aspect. It is, in
                        truth, a provision prohibiting discrimination against
                        the imported goods. In the matter of levy of tax -
                        and this is important to bear in mind - the clause
                        tells the State Legislatures - 'tax you may the goods
                        imported from other States/Union Territories but do
                        not, in that process discriminate against them vis-a-
                        vis goods manufactured locally'. In short, the clause
                        says levy of tax on both ought to be at the same
                        rate. This was and is a ringing declaration against
                        the States creating what may be called "tax
                        barriers" - or fiscal barrier", as they may be called -
                        at or along their boundaries in the interest of
                        freedom       of    trade,    commerce      and    intercourse
                        throughout         the   territory   of   India,   guaranteed
                        by ', Article 301.',  As we shall presently point out, this
                        clause does not prevent in any manner the States
                        from encouraging or promoting the local industries
                        in such manner as they think fit so long as they do
                        not use the weapon of taxation to discriminate
                        against the imported goods vis-a-vis the locally
                        manufactured goods. To repeat, the clause bars the

                        States from creating tax barriers - or fiscal barriers,
                        as they can be called - around themselves and/or
                        insulate themselves from the remaining territories
                        of India by erecting such 'tariff walls'. Part-XIII is
                        premised upon the assumption that so long as a
                        State taxes its residents and the residents of other
                        States uniformly, there is no infringement of the
                        freedom guaranteed by ", Article 301;',  no State would
                        tax its people at a higher level merely with a view
                        to tax the people of other States at that level. And it
                        is this clause which has a crucial bearing on this
                        case. Now coming to clause (b), it empowers the
                        legislature of the State to make a law and "impose
                        such reasonable restrictions on the freedom of
                        trade, commerce or intercourse with or within that
                        State as may be required in the public interest;
                        provided       that     no     Dill   or   amendment        for   the
                        purposes of clause (b) shall be introduced or moved
                        in the Legislature of a State without the previous
                        sanction of the President". (This proviso has, of
                        course, to be read along with ', Article 255',  which says
                        that if the Act receives the assent of the Presidents
                        the     non-compliance            with     the   requirement       of
                        obtaining the previous sanction to the introduction
                        of the Bill is cured.) Though in appearance this
                        clause      reads       like     conferring      on   the     State
                        Legislatures a power akin to the power conferred
                        upon the Parliament by ', Article 302', , there are
                        certain distinctions. Firstly, while ', Article 302', , does
                        not use the expression "reasonable" before the
                        word "restrictions," this clause does. Secondly, this
                        power can be exercised by the State Legislature
                        only with the "previous sanction" of the President-

                        which means the Union Ministry, or with the assent
                        of the President, as explained above. It is probably
                        our history which impelled the founding fathers to
                        lay store by the Central Government in the matter
                        of imposing restrictions, or reasonable restrictions,
                        as the case may be on the freedom guaranteed, it is
                        worthy of notice, is "throughout the territory of
                        India" and not merely between the States as such;
                        the emphasis is upon the oneness of the territory of
                        India. Part-XIII starts with this concept of oneness
                        but then it provides exceptions to that rule, as
                        stated above, to meet certain emerging situations.
                        As a matter of fact, it can well be said that clause
',                         (a) of ', Article 304',  is not really an exception to ', Article
                        301', ,     notwithstanding        the   non-obstante    clause
                        in ', Article 304',  and that it is but a re-statement of a
                        facet of the very freedom guaranteed by ', Article
                        301', , viz., power of taxation by the States. (We
                        need not refer to the other articles in Part-XIII for
                        the purposes of this case).\u2016

                        simple cases of hostile discrimination. Therefore,
                        whether a particular tax is discriminatory within the
                        meaning of this clause, the effect of the tax on the

                        Government by a notification exempted dealers
                        from sales tax of hosiery goods manufactured and
                        produced in the State of Bihar whereas levied sales
                        tax on the dealers outside the State. This Court
                        opined that from the commercial or normal point of
                        view, such a discriminatory levy of sales tax would
                        have an effect that would be bound to affect the
                        free flow of hosiery goods from outside State into
                        the      State      of    Bihar   and   would   therefore
                        violate ', article 301',  read with ', article 304(a)',  of the
                        Constitution of India.
', 
',                                     ...
', 
',                                     62. The exemption or rebate of tax is
                        therefore within the purview of taxation. In the
                        instant case, if the grant of rebate of tax by the
                        State Government under ', Section 5',  of the Act is to
                        the full amount of tax levied, then for the dealers
                        manufacturing cement using fly-ash outside the
                        State of Uttar Pradesh but selling it in Uttar
                        Pradesh, though the State Government contends
                        that the rate of tax is same for the dealers inside
                        Uttar Pradesh and outside Uttar Pradesh, but the
                        overall effect is that there is no tax levied on the
                        net turnover after deductions being made from the
                        gross turnover but, on the other hand, the dealers
                        manufacturing or producing cement using fly-ash
                        outside Uttar Pradesh are taxed at the rate of
                        12.5%. Therefore, it can be said that the rebate of
                        tax is in the nature of exemption and the instant
                        case can be decided on the basis of catena of
                        decisions of this Court where blanket exemption
                        without reasons are said to be discriminatory and

                        violating ', article 304(a)',  of the Constitution of India.



',                      97. It needs to be borne in mind that in Jaiprakash

         Associates (supra), the Supreme Court held that the object of

         ', Article 304(a)',  of the Constitution is to prevent imported goods

         being discriminated by imposing a higher tax thereon than on

         local goods. It has been held that what ', Article 304(a)',  demands

         is that the rate of taxation on local goods as well as imported

         goods must be the same. This is designed to discourage the

         State from creating the State barriers or fiscal barriers at its

         boundaries.
', 
', 
',                      98. The Supreme Court has, in no uncertain words

         clarified, in Jaiprakash Associates (supra), that the principle

         of "non-discriminatory tax", as provided in ', Article 304(a)',  of the

         Constitution of India, is a sine qua non to free movement of

         goods between nation/States in several jurisdictions and also in

         international trade and policy.
', 
', 
',                      99. Discrimination is spoken of in terms of effect and

         intention behind such discrimination. The Supreme Court has

         held, in Jaiprakash Associates (supra), that effect of a tax

         should not such that two like goods are given discriminatory

         treatment. The powers given to the State legislature are not

         unrestricted and are bound to function within limitations

         stipulated under ', Article 304(a)',  of the Constitution of India.

',                      100. When ', Article 304(a)',  ensures only equal rate for

         incoming goods, if such goods are taxed at a higher rate or

         where they are taxed at any rate, when indigenous goods

         enjoy concessional rate of tax, ', Article 304(a)',  gets attracted.

         These are simple cases of hostile discrimination. However, one

         has to determine whether a particular tax is discriminatory or

         not within the meaning of ', Article 304(a', ), the effect of the tax,

         on the flow of goods from outside the taxing State, has to be

         taken into consideration and if the overall effect of rebate of

         tax is such that they fall within the meaning of concessional

         rates of tax so as to discriminate between imported goods and

         local goods, the same would amount to discrimination within

         the meaning of 304(a) of the Constitution. The set off, as given

         in ', Section 3(2)',  of the 1993 Act, cannot be used as a device or

         weapon so as to make a discrimination in the rate of tax by

         repaying or by allowing set off to one class of local dealers of

         the entry tax paid against the VAT payable and not allowing the

         benefit of set off to outside dealers. Such a situation squarely

         falls within the ambit of ', Article 304(a)',  of the Constitution of

         India.
', 
', 
',                      101. By giving set off under second Proviso to ', Section

         3(2)',  of the 1993 Act, a favourable treatment is given to one

         class of dealers within the State, barring the dealers, similarly

         placed outside the State, supplying goods to the State of Bihar

         in course of inter-State trade and commerce, the effect

         whereof is that no entry tax is payable by a dealer making

         resale of the said goods inside the State, but, on the other

         hand, the dealers, who are supplying goods from outside the

         State to consumers, have to pay full entry tax as well as

         central sales tax. The net effect of the impugned provisions is

         that the cumulative burden of taxes, on goods imported from

         outside the State, is higher than the said goods produced

         within the State. This is what is known as fiscal barrier and

         such fiscal barrier has a direct and immediate effect of ensuring

         that goods are brought in from outside the State of Bihar for

         personal use or consumption on payment of CST and thereby

         making a discrimination between the dealers of one State and

         another, which is clearly violative of ', Article 304(a)',  of the

         Constitution.
', 
', 
',                      102. In the present case, respondents have not

         disputed that there is a higher burden of tax on goods brought

         in by the petitioners for individual consumers through e-

         commerce transactions; but the State has tried to defend the

         same by contending that since the levy is compensatory in

         nature, the State has the power to impose such discriminatory

         tax.
', 
', 
',                      103. As discussed in the preceding paragraphs of this

         judgment, we are unable to agree with the effect of the
 Patna High Court CWJC No.6155 of 2016 dt.27-09-2016

',                                          88/89', 




         submissions of the              learned Principal Additional Advocate

         General that in case of compensatory tax, the State has the

         power      to   resort     to    discrimination.   Even   if   the   levy   is

         compensatory          in    nature,      the   compensation     cannot      be

         demanded more from an outside dealer than a local dealer.

         There cannot be any discrimination between an outside dealer

         and a local dealer. Since the impugned provisions clearly

         discriminate between an outside dealer and local dealer by

         imposing higher burden of tax on goods supplied by outside

         dealer than a local dealer, the same is clearly hit by ', Article

         304(a)',  of the Constitution of India.
', 
', 
',                      104. Since we have already held the impugned

         provisions to be discriminatory and violative of ', Article 304(a)',  of

         the Constitution of India read with ', Article 303',  of Constitution of

         India, it is not necessary to examine the other contentions

         advanced on behalf of the petitioner.

',                      105. In the result and for the forgoing reasons, these

         writ petitions are allowed. The impugned provisions of the

         and Notifications S.O. 176 & 18 both, dated 20.01.2016, are

         declared as ultra vires to the Constitution and are accordingly
