The Social Security District Office or field office is the local Social Security office at which you can file a claim for Social Security Disability benefits in person. The District Office does not evaluate Social Security Disability applications and instead it sends claims disability determination services (DDS) to be evaluated. After your Social Security Disability case is evaluated, it will be returned to the District Office.
', 
', 
The District Office conducts the initial in-person interview, which can be set up by calling 800-772-1213 after you have submitted your application for Social Security Disability benefits. At the interview you will meet your assigned claims representative who will handle your claim through the Social Security Disability application process. Therefore, it is important to request your claim representative\u2019s telephone phone number. Staying in touch with your Claims Rep is a good way to find out where your Social Security Disability application is in the approval process and what information has not yet been gathered. You can often expedite the disability application process by contacting doctors or other medical personnel that have not responded to requests from Social Security for information.
', 
', 
When submitting medical evidence to the District Office make a copy of everything you give your Claims Representative as it is common for one or more documents to be misplaced between the District Office and disability determination services.  Also, you can bring your documentation to your initial interview so that you do not have to worry about it getting lost in the mail.
', 
', 
If your Social Security Disability claim is approved, you will be assigned a ', Claims Representative',  in the District Office who will ensure that your monthly benefits are paid and that you receive the back pay (past due benefits) that you may be owed. If you are an SSI recipient, your Claims Representative will handle your benefit distribution directly.
