purchased and the design and approval process was commenced.

development, Gateway Estates in Darfield has recently been approved
and sold.', 

', Other Projects', 

', u"Completed developments by family owned companies include the
ownership, management and redevelopment of the Sydney shopping
centres, Northbridge Plaza and Neeta City and the development of a

a  majority shareholding in a major residential and retail
project in Milton, Brisbane the Development Approved site was sold

', Our policy is to design and construct quality developments that
make a difference and stand the test of time. We invest more to
ensure that each development provides a high level of amenity. We
strive to build long term relationships rather than seeking short
term gain and conduct ourselves with integrity and honesty. It is
important to us to ensure client satisfaction.',
