There is one thing, in particular, which connects them with history. One of the canons of the futuristic painters, as propounded by Modigliani, was that objects behind other objects should not be lost to view, but should be shown through the others by making the latter transparent. The wire sculpture accomplishes this in a most decided manner', . (CF, Calder, unpublished manuscript)',

',  There are environments that appear to remain fixed whilst there are small occurrences that take place at great speed across them. They appear so only because one sees nothing but the mobility of the small occurrences. ',  We notice the movement of automobiles and beings in the street, but we do not notice that the earth turns. We believe that automobiles go at a great speed on a fixed ground; yet the speed of the earth\u2019s rotation at the equator is 40,000 km every 24 hours. ',  As truly serious art must follow the greater laws, and not only appearances, I try to put all the elements in motion in my mobile sculptures. ',  It is a matter of harmonizing these movements, thus arriving at a new possibility of beauty. ',  ', (CF, Calder, unpublished manuscript)',

', We had a lot of visitors\u2014Léger, Picasso, Carl Einstein, Binks Einstein, Petro van Doesburg, Cocteau, Roux, etc.\u2014who all were enthusiastic about "abstract sculptures which move" (toy elec. motors being used). There was only one dissenter . . . that was Mondrian. He said they weren't fast enough, and when I stepped on the gas, he said they still weren't fast enough, so I said I'd make one especially fast, to please him, and then he said that that wouldn't be fast enough\u2014because the whole thing ought to be still.

', 1898', 
', 22 July or August: Calder is born in Lawnton, Pennsylvania, to Nanette Lederer Calder, a painter, and Alexander Stirling Calder, a sculptor. ', I always thought I was born\u2014at least my mother always told me so\u2014on August 22, 1898. But my grandfather Milne\u2019s birthday was on August 23, so there might have been a little confusion. In 1942, when I wrote the Philadelphia City Hall for a birth certificate, I sent them a dollar and they told me I was born on the twenty-second of July, 1898. So I sent them another dollar and told them, \u201cLook again.\u201d They corroborated the first statement.',  (Calder 1966, 11)',

(Calder 1966, 21)', 
', Fall: ', My sister had quite a few dolls for which we made extraordinary jewelry from beads and very fine copper wire that we found in the street left over by men splicing electric cables', . (Calder 1952, 37)',

', Winter: The Calders move to Croton-on-Hudson, New York. Calder has a cellar for his workshop and attends Croton Public School. (Calder 1966, 28\u201329)', 
', December: For Christmas, Calder presents his parents with a dog and a duck that he trimmed from a brass sheet and bent into formation. The duck is kinetic, rocking back and forth when tapped. (Sweeney 1943, 57; Hayes 1977, 41)', 
', u"Before 11 January: For his father's birthday, Calder makes ", Animal Zoo Puzzle', , a game consisting of five painted animals\u2014a tiger, a lion, and three bears\u2014and a wooden board with nails divided into six pens. The challenge is to move the animals from their pens without having two animals in the same pen at once. (Hayes 1977, 42)',

We believe that automobiles go at a great speed on a fixed ground; yet the speed of the earth\u2019s rotation at the equator is 40,000 km every 24 hours.

There was only one dissenter . . . that was Mondrian. He said they weren't fast enough, and when I stepped on the gas, he said they still weren't fast enough, so I said I'd make one especially fast, to please him, and then he said that that wouldn't be fast enough\u2014because the whole thing ought to be still.

Each disc and its supporting pulleys is in a ', separate vertical plane', u" parallel to the frame. The number of discs can be increased indefinitely\u2013\u2013depending on the necessary clearances. In addition to discs there are coloured pennants (of cloth), with weights on them, which fly at high speed\u2013\u2013and various solid objects, bits of hose, springs, etc. [...] I had this in Paris the spring of 1933 and showed it to Massine\u2013\u2013 along with many other things, and it's what I wanted to do for the Ballets Russes.
