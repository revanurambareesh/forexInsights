Today&rsquo;s startups combine scalable, pre-built components from public cloud vendors, API services and the open source community, and deploy them on broadly installed open platforms (mobile, web, Android, Linux).

For SaaS companies, we found that MRR is the best metric on which to base sales commissions. While it may make sense to offer very slight adjustments for favorable payment terms and one time revenue, net additions to MRR should dominate the sales rep&rsquo;s thoughts.

It includes the market size, of course, but also the competitive dynamics, your network in the country (or your investor network) and the similarity with your home country. For example, in my experience, what works in France tends to also work well in Italy and Spain, but the U.K. can be an outlier.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\r\n\u003Cp id=\"e8c1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\u003E\u003Cstrong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"\u003ECash Requirements:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Be clever with your resources. It is very important to assess your cost of capital and how much burn you can afford. If you raised &euro;20 million in your Series A, you can take more risks and launch abroad sooner than if you raised &euro;3&ndash;4 million. Picking a large market is attractive, but if it requires a level of investment that would reduce your runway considerably, you may be better off picking a smaller market.

For SaaS companies, we found that MRR is the best metric on which to base sales commissions. While it may make sense to offer very slight adjustments for favorable payment terms and one time revenue, net additions to MRR should dominate the sales rep&rsquo;s thoughts.

It includes the market size, of course, but also the competitive dynamics, your network in the country (or your investor network) and the similarity with your home country. For example, in my experience, what works in France tends to also work well in Italy and Spain, but the U.K. can be an outlier.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\r\n\u003Cp id=\"e8c1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\u003E\u003Cstrong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"\u003ECash Requirements:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Be clever with your resources. It is very important to assess your cost of capital and how much burn you can afford. If you raised &euro;20 million in your Series A, you can take more risks and launch abroad sooner than if you raised &euro;3&ndash;4 million. Picking a large market is attractive, but if it requires a level of investment that would reduce your runway considerably, you may be better off picking a smaller market.

Today&rsquo;s startups combine scalable, pre-built components from public cloud vendors, API services and the open source community, and deploy them on broadly installed open platforms (mobile, web, Android, Linux).

For SaaS companies, we found that MRR is the best metric on which to base sales commissions. While it may make sense to offer very slight adjustments for favorable payment terms and one time revenue, net additions to MRR should dominate the sales rep&rsquo;s thoughts.

It includes the market size, of course, but also the competitive dynamics, your network in the country (or your investor network) and the similarity with your home country. For example, in my experience, what works in France tends to also work well in Italy and Spain, but the U.K. can be an outlier.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\r\n\u003Cp id=\"e8c1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\u003E\u003Cstrong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"\u003ECash Requirements:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Be clever with your resources. It is very important to assess your cost of capital and how much burn you can afford. If you raised &euro;20 million in your Series A, you can take more risks and launch abroad sooner than if you raised &euro;3&ndash;4 million. Picking a large market is attractive, but if it requires a level of investment that would reduce your runway considerably, you may be better off picking a smaller market.

For SaaS companies, we found that MRR is the best metric on which to base sales commissions. While it may make sense to offer very slight adjustments for favorable payment terms and one time revenue, net additions to MRR should dominate the sales rep&rsquo;s thoughts.

It includes the market size, of course, but also the competitive dynamics, your network in the country (or your investor network) and the similarity with your home country. For example, in my experience, what works in France tends to also work well in Italy and Spain, but the U.K. can be an outlier.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\r\n\u003Cp id=\"e8c1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\u003E\u003Cstrong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"\u003ECash Requirements:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Be clever with your resources. It is very important to assess your cost of capital and how much burn you can afford. If you raised &euro;20 million in your Series A, you can take more risks and launch abroad sooner than if you raised &euro;3&ndash;4 million. Picking a large market is attractive, but if it requires a level of investment that would reduce your runway considerably, you may be better off picking a smaller market.
