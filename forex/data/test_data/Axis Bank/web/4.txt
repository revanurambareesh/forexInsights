eKYC[62] is an online/paperless Aadhaar card based process for fulfilling KYC requirements to start investing in Mutual Funds without submission of any documents. SEBI has recently allowed Aadhaar based KYC to be used for MF investments, for the convenience of investors.
The first step in starting your investment in mutual fund is KYC compliance. KYC verification enables you to open new accounts with all SEBI registered intermediaries such as the Mutual Funds, Stock Brokers, Portfolio Managers, Depository Participants, Venture Capital Funds and Collective Investment Schemes eliminating the need to repeat standard KYC. The normal KYC process requires submission of KYC form along with investor signature and additional documents for ID and address proof. In-person verification (IPV) and sighting the original documents needs to be completed by a competent person. eKYC completely eliminates paperwork and IPV to complete the KYC process.
