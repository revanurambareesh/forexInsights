Aura Imaging Pedal contains acoustic Images of a specific guitar chosen for

through a number of premier mics (including Neumann, DPA, and Schoeps) and a

Dreadnought and
Nylon pedals. The guitars used were a Takamine EG522C Classical 
Acoustic-Electric, a Martin Custom Adirondack dreadnought (the result of a 
collaborative effort between Martin and Musician\u2019s Friend), and an Alvarez 
Professional Series PD80SC Dreadnought Cutaway. I chose these instruments based 
on a price range of $500 to $1,500 to cover the widest variety of ownership. I 
was particularly curious to see if Fishman\u2019s Dreadnought pedal would work on the cutaway since body shape plays an 
important role. ',  ',

can get similar results from a $199 pedal as you can from $4,000 worth of mics 
and preamps, sans hours of setup, you\u2019re golden. My setup employed a Royer 121 
ribbon mic, BPM CR-10 condenser (handmade German) mic, and Summit preamps. Each 
guitar was recorded in four passes, one with the Royer, one with the BPM, direct 
through the Aura, and one with the mics set up in mid-side stereo. ',  ',

through the Aura pedal with the blend control turned all the way down, the sound 
of the guitar was immediately improved. Better still, the
Dreadnought pedal worked equally well on the Alvarez cutaway as it did with 
the traditional Martin dreadnought. On every A/B test between mics and Images, 
the Aura pedal easily held its own. In fact, the Image that I felt worked best

		world-class mic locker by re-amping a dry track through the Aura pedal.

predicted\u2014interesting, but not as satisfying as the direct match. Just for fun, 
I tried the Orchestra pedal with my PRS CE 24 electric, which I always felt was a little 
thin sounding. Bonus! I actually got a really sweet, extra-sparkly sound in the 
out-of-phase pickup position, and it added a nice thickness to the neck position 
pickup. It was exactly the sound I felt I was missing. I wouldn\u2019t go so far as
