', Abstract', 

', 
The aim of this work was to develop ', in vitro',  digestion models for 
mimicking the physiological conditions of upper intestine and microbial 
conversions in the colon. The main emphasis was on the microbial metabolism of 
plant phenolic compounds: pure quercetin derivatives, pure anthocyanins and 
lignans from rye bran and flaxseed.
', 
', 
When cereal samples are introduced to an ', in vitro',  colon a removal of 
digestible components, is needed. An enzymatic ', in vitro',  digestion 
model was developed for maximal starch removal from cereal samples. Pepsin, 
pancreatin and bile concentrations were optimized using an experimental 
design. Surprisingly, pepsin and bile also affected the extent of starch 
hydrolysis in synergy with pancreatin. 5-11 % of the original amount of 
starch remained in the residues of cereal products. Proteins were also partly 
hydrolysed. The ', in vitro',  enzymatic digestion model was used for the 
pretreatment of rye bran and flaxseed samples.
', 
', 
An anaerobic ', in vitro',  colon model, conventionally used for the 
fermentation of non-digestible carbohydrates, was developed further for 
studying pure of phenolic compounds. Human faecal microbiota from several 
healthy donors was used in the preparation of an inoculum. A low inoculum 
concentration was used for decreasing the metabolite concentration from the 
faecal background in the studies concerning pure flavonoids. A dense faecal 
suspension was suitable for the conversion of rye bran and flaxseed lignans to 
enterolactone when the plant matrix was present.
', 
', 
Flavonoids were deconjugated and degraded to phenolic acids by faecal 
microbiota. Specific activities of the deconjugative enzymes from the faecal 
inocula reflected the deconjugation rates of flavonoids. Quercetin aglycone 
was converted to hydroxyphenylacetic acids, but not to methylated phenolic 
acids. The extent of metabolism was 60 %, showing that ring-fission was a 
dominating route in the microbial metabolism of quercetin. Anthocyanins also 
underwent similar conversion, but the estimated extent of metabolite formation 
was low (less than 5 %). Protocatechuic acid was identified, and a 
phenoxyacid or a phenoxyaldehyde was proposed, as ring-fission products of 
cyanidin. In addition, it was suggested that anthocyanins undergo conjugation 
with an unknown moiety of 85 mass units. This conjugate was observed for 
several anthocyanins.
', 
', 
Enterolactone production from plant lignans proceeded steadily and slowly for 
48 hours in the ', in vitro',  colon model using the dense 
(16.7 %) faecal suspension. Flaxseed lignan conversion to enterolactone 
was suppressed by the presence of rye matrix. The enterolactone-producing 
microbiota may be sensitive to non-physiological, low pH values caused by 
acidoc components from rye bran in the presence of microbiota. The presence of 
rye bran matrix did not interfere with enterolactone formation in an ', in 
vivo',  rat model. The difference in the response to the rye bran matrix may 
be due to the absorption of the released and metabolised compounds in rats. 
Rats may also adapt to the diet during their feeding period. This may have 
enhanced the enterolactone production, and may have further increased the 
difference between the bioactivity of the microbiota in the ', in vitro',  
and ', in vivo',  models used in this study.
', 
', 
Clinical human and animal trials describe end-point metabolism after 
adaptation to the test diet. The ', in vitro',  colon model assists in 
elucidation of the role of microbiota in the metabolical network of human 
digestive system and it helps in identification of the crucial reactions. 
Applications of this method can be extended from the studies of food 
components to pharmaceutical research.
