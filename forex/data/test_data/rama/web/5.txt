Greetings.
I have been a sysop on en: from the 5th of May 2005 [1] and on commons: from the 29th of August 2005 [2], and Oversight on Commons since the 5th of January 2009 [3].
There is a small page to explain how to use my images. Nevertheless, do not hesitate to contact me should you have any question.

Contact[edit]
You can contact me through my talk page (add a new discussion) or write me an e-mail. I will usually answer within 24 hours.
I might also be available on IRC on the #wikimedia-commonswebchat and #wikipedia-frwebchat channels (Freenode network).
Points to consider[edit]
Archives and personal archives[edit]
Through photography, [seminarian Stanislas Hutin] attempts to constitute a third group where he would not be alone: those who have seen. With handy and lightweight cameras, conscripted soldiers take numerous photographs of their activities in Algeria. (...) In addition to these photographs that were meant as proofs, how many are still lying in French attics with other war souvenirs of the veterans of the Algeria War?
 La torture et l'arme pendant la guerre d'Algrie, Raphalle Branche, Gallimard.
Many valuable documents are probably sitting in attics. We should ask elderly people to review their personal archives and consider publishing them under Free licences.
Orphan works[edit]
Orphan works are not in the public domain. Prosecution can happen.
Corrolary: images whose author is unknown are not anonymous, and most certainly not in the public domain 70 years after publication.
Achievements[edit]
Images[edit]
I have contributed 12 Featured pictures, 342 Quality Images and 20 Valued pictures as photographs. I also draw and I am competent with SVG graphics.
I am interested in portrait photography, and have thus documented several Nobel laureates and other notable figures (see User:Rama/people). I do a fair amount of technical photography in museums, sometimes with accreditation obtained directly, through Wikimdia France or through Wikimedia CH.
Associative activities[edit]
I take part in activities supported and organised by Wikimdia France and Wikimedia CH. I occasionally lend professional photographic equipment to fellow Wikipedians, and benefit from press accreditations and specialised equipment procured notably by Wikimedia CH.
I notably organised or was involved in the following events (for instance):
I took part in Projet Phoebus (image samples)
I organised the Paris Photo Workshop of 2010
I introduced Commons to User:Evstafiev. See his photographs and weep.
I organised a partnership with the Bolo computer museum (image samples)
I obtained accreditations to photograph the Army museum of Morges castle (image samples)
I obtained accreditations to photograph the Lausanne historical museum (image samples)
I obtained accreditations to photograph the Lausanne Roman museum (image samples)
Wikimedia France provided me with accreditations to photograph the Eurockennes de Belfort in 2007 (image samples)
I obtained accreditations to photograph the Eurockennes de Belfort in 2011 (images)
I obtained accreditations to photograph Ballec in 2011 (images)
I obtained accreditations to photograph Lyon fine Arts museum (image samples)
I obtained permission to photograph Paul Regnier's personnal weapon collection (image samples)
I obtained permission to photograph the 2011 Geneva book fair (image samples)
Wikimedia-CH provided me with permission to photograph the cryptography collection of the Swiss Army headquarters (images)
Using Wikimedia-CH credentials, I obtained a press accreditation for the 6th World Water Forum (images)
