				', \u201cSome company recently was interested in buying my \u2018aura,\u2019 they didn\u2019t want my product.\u201d    \u2014 Andy Warhol, ', The Philosophy of Andy Warhol', 
', The word ', aura',  dates to antiquity (Latin, \u2018breath\u2019 or \u2018breeze;  later, \u2018a subtle emanation from any substance\u2019) and has been used in  numerous ways, not least to describe the existence of electromagnetic  fields around the human ', body',  (OED). Although this usage predates Walter Benjamin\u2019s 1936 essay \u201cThe Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,\u201d ', i',  the use of the term in contemporary media studies is dominated by the  specter of Benjamin and by his elaboration of the term here and in his  work on the storyteller and Baudelaire. \u2018Aura\u2019 refers to the authority  held by the unique, original work, which under modernity is liquidated  by the techniques of mass reproduction. This involvement with ', authenticity',  and reproduction squarely ensconces Benjamin in an older debate over  the nature of the original and the copy, which dates to Plato and  continues through today in (amongst others) ', Jean Baudrillard',  and Gilles Deleuze.  Benjamin\u2019s entrypoint to aura is his concern with technical  reproducibility. Aura for him refers first and foremostly to a certain  kind of ', aesthetic',  ', presence',  of art, grounded in religious experience, and eliminated by the modern development of the ', technologies',  of reproduction\u2013photography and especially ', film', .  Aura also, however, refers to the model of a certain kind of  intersubjective experience, in the experience of an object gazing back  at one. In this way Benjamin means to approach both ', aesthetics',  and ethics and, in doing so, to approach what mass media might mean as  the grounds for a revolutionary politics. As Miriam Hansen argues,  however, the tension in Benjamin between the liberatory potential of  mass media and the vulgarity it represents is never fully resolved  (Hansen 187).', 
', 1. Aura, Presence, Politics', 
The aura of a work issues from the ', presence',  it has: from being situated squarely in a particular ', space',  and having a certain history, or in other words, its ', authenticity', .  The ceiling of the Sistine Chapel has an aura\u2013and an authority\u2013which  derives not only from its formal qualities but the fact of its being in  the Vatican, having lasted five centuries, having been painted by the  hand of Michelangelo, and even more than that, that it cannot ever be  duplicated. A replica of an entire Dutch village has been built in the  south of Japan but it is throughly ', without aura', : it lacks the tradition of the former, the history of the former, it is ersatz and in this sense ', inauthentic', . As Benjamin writes, \u201cEven the most perfect reproduction of a work of art is lacking in one element: its ', presence',  in ', time',  and ', space', ,  its unique existence at the place where it happens to be (Benjamin  220).\u201d Under modernity aura becomes degraded: in the proliferation of  reproductions, the authority of the original is obliterated. To be sure,  ', technologies',  of reproduction have always existed. But for Benjamin there is a  categorical difference between the reproduction the Greeks were capable  of and the technical reproduction we are capable of. Inherent in the  medium of ', photography',  is the process of reproduction: a negative can be used to produce an  infinite number of prints, none of which can really be called an  \u2018original.\u2019 ', Technologies',  such as the lithograph and the photograph allow the work of art to be  reproduced endlessly, and not only reproduced\u2013but allow it to be ', seen better', ,  as in process reproduction, which can enlarge an original. Reproduction  can also transport the original to \u201csituations where it would be out of  reach for the original itself (Benjamin 220),\u201d for example, when the  Sistine Chapel is reproduced in middle school civilizations textbooks.  The ', aura',  that issues from apprehending the Sistine Chapel in the state of its  history, in the Vatican, dissipates with each reproduction. As Benjamin  writes, \u201c[T]he technique of reproduction detaches the reproduced object  from the domain of tradition,\u201d which is to say, it takes the object out  of the ', time',  and place in which it was made. Reproductions are not just other objects: they degrade the ', aura',  of the original.', 
', But while aura is to be found in ', authenticity', , Benjamin is very careful to tether it to religious life ', ii', .  Benjamin being a certain kind of Marxist, the destruction of aura\u2013and  the progression of history\u2013cannot be read in elegiac terms: the end of  aura is also the end of the ritual and political structures which  surround aura. \u201c[T]he unique value of the \u2018authentic\u2019 work of art has  its basis in ritual, the location of its original use value\u2026 for the  first ', time',  in world history, mechanical reproduction emancipates the work of art  from its parasitical dependence on ritual\u201d (Benjamin 224). The  destruction of aura in \u201cThe Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical  Reproduction\u201d is also the destruction of a certain kind of social  organization which propagates it in the first place. The unspoken debt  in Benjamin\u2019s discussion of ritual is to Durkheim and his discussion, in  ', The Elementary Forms of Religious Life', , of ', mana',  (to which ', aura',  is closely tied, as it is a power from which authority issues) and to  his affirmation of the hierarchical nature of early societies. The new  technologies of mechanical reproducibility are above all, then,  emancipatory technologies: mass culture is positioned as a kind of  democratization when, as under the regime of mechanical reproducibility,  the authentic original disappears, and the legitimation of political  resistance thus becomes unnecessary. Benjamin self-consciously means for  \u201cThe Work of Art\u2026\u201d to function as a political exhortation: \u201cThe  concepts which are introduced into the theory of art in what follows\u2026  are useful for the formulation of revolutionary demands in the politics  of art,\u201d he proclaims. Aura is an aesthetic experience; but above all,  for Benjamin, the liquidation of aura is a kind of political  emancipation. In the age of technical reproduction, the authentic,  original ', image',  or document ', cannot',  exist; asking the question of ', authenticity',  of a Microsoft Word document is for Benjamin incomprehensible. \u201cThe instant the criterion of ', authenticity',  ceases to be applicable to artistic production, the total function of  art is reversed. Instead of being based on ritual, it begins to be based  on another practice\u2013politics (Benjamin 224).\u201d The politics of ', aura',  under premodernity are such that the work of art is out of reach for most people: the reliquaries of the church and the ', Kunstkammern',  of the German princes are closed to the eyes of the public. In the reproduction of works of art\u2013in ', photography',  and in ', film',  and in print\u2013there is a radical accessibility at work, which for  Benjamin opens up the possibility of finding in the work of art a place  for revolution.', 
', But while true aura dissipates under modernity, Benjamin does  note that it resurfaces in mass culture as a kind of dream image: it is  refigured, as pastiche, in the production of mass culture. One example  of this refiguring would be Ikea furniture design: the design of an  eccentric and homely chair is meant specifically to elide or gloss the  enormous global distribution networks from which it emerges. Susan  Buck-Morss describes the habit of buying covers and boxes and packages  for our bought objects, by which we seem to want to make a home for them  (Buck-Morss 184). Aura, thus, resurfaces in its dissolution as ersatz  tragicomedy; and more than this, Benjamin has through asserting this  foreclosed absolutely on the possibility of any kind of restoration of  the mystery and distance of the world, of traditional notions of  subjectivity, by working through the structures of capital. If one is to  formulate a revolutionary politics based on mass culture it cannot be  predicated on finding a home within mass culture.', 
', One might argue, however, that the conception of aura which I  have just presented is as unstable as its namesake: as Miriam Hansen  argues in \u201cBenjamin, Cinema, and Experience: \u2018The Blue Flower in the ', Land',  of ', Technology', u",'\u201d Benjamin\u2019s conception of aura, when ", mapped',  against the theory of experience as found in his work on Baudelaire and  on storytelling, is \u2018profoundly ambivalent\u2019 (Hansen 187). In \u201cThe  Storyteller,\u201d for example, Benjamin decries the devaluing of  \u2018experience\u2019, and ennobles the teller of stories: \u201cExperience has fallen  in value\u2026 Every glance at a ', newspaper',  demonstrates that it has reached a new low\u2026 (Benjamin 83-84)\u201d It  should be clear that this is an entirely different tack than is taken in  the ebullient optimism of \u201cThe Work of Art\u2026,\u201d that what is being  decried here is in fact that which the other essay takes as the new  direction for revolutionary politics. Aura is by no means a unitary  concept unto itself for Benjamin and his ambivalent oscillation between  the emancipatory possibilities of mass culture and the sense of mass  culture\u2019s degradation remains a problem for contemporary media studies.  To some extent Benjamin\u2019s work in mass culture can be read as a  predecessor of ', Jean Baudrillard', , who writes in ', Simulacra and Simulation', :  \u201cSimulation is no longer that of a territory, a referential being, or a  substance. It is the generation by models of a real without origin or  reality: a hyperreal (Baudrillard 1).\u201d In this sense Benjamin\u2019s  assertion that the original under technical reproduction ceases to exist  is taken to its most extreme in Baudrillard, in which the  disintegration of the original has been such that it is no longer, even,  a point of reference. The hyperreal spins off reproductions endlessly,  without grounding. (See also articles on simulation, simulacrum: ', 1', , ', 2', ).', 
', 2. Returning the Gaze', 
If one aspect of the aura was the question of its uniqueness, another is  the way it is ensconced in a certain kind of subjectivity. \u2018Aura\u2019  implies a relation between the object and the ', spectator', u" which, for Benjamin, is a relation characterized by distance. \u201cWe  define the aura of [natural objects] as the unique phenomenon of a  distance, however close it may be. If, while resting on a summer  afternoon, you follow with your eyes a mountain range on the horizon or a  branch which casts its shadow over you, you experience the aura of  those mountains, of that branch (Benjamin 222-223).\u201d This idea of  contemplation, important for Benjamin\u2019s conception of what conditions  are necessary for critique to be possible, thus implies a certain kind  of distance and a certain kind of subjectivity. As Susan Buck-Morss  rejoins to this, \u201cCharacteristic of aura, despite its \u2018unique phenomenon  of distance,\u2019 was the sense that \u2018the gaze is returned (Buck-Morss  194).'\u201d If one were ever to find an ambivalence in Benjamin it would be  here: for Benjamin, in the watching of a ", film',  one relates not to the ', face',  of the actor (who is directed towards an infinite number of spectators ', ad infinitum', ),  but to the camera. In saying this he means to call attention to the  technical medium, which enacts a generalized degradation. This is,  however, the same medium by which he hopes to launch a platform for a  radical politics. Inasmuch as the concept ennobles ', authenticity', ,  it places Benjamin squarely on one side of a debate which dates back to  Plato\u2013which is to say that in this position, Benjamin is making a  certain claim about the degradation and inadequacy of the copy, famously  explicated in Plato\u2019s \u201cAllegory of the Cave,\u201d although the issue of  \u2018the modern break\u2019 for him looms large in a way which it does not for  his ancient forebearer. Yet it also ennobles a certain kind of politics  which lead ultimately to the very unseating of the mechanics of  reproducibility.', 
', 3. Aura since Benjamin', 
', Despite the fact that at the ', time',  of its conceptualization, aura was for Benjamin a concept withering  under duress, it remains important for its engagement with issues which  remain front and center for art historical ', discourse', , especially as regards ', authenticity', . Rosalind Krauss et al in ', Art Since 1900',  describes Donald Judd as attempting very baldly to eradicate any sense  of \u2018aura\u2019, by which is meant the hand of the artist, the uniqueness of a  particular piece. In a 1990 public letter to Jacques Derrida, the  architect Peter Eisenman writes of the need in ', architecture',  to ', create',  auras, which he glosses as \u201cthe possibility of a presentness of  something else\u201d (Eisenman 17), or in other words, a gesturing into the  beyond, an open-endedness. \u201cBut I am not talking about this kind of  Benjaminian aura\u2013the aura of metaphysical fullness,\u201d Eisenman is quick  to rejoin, \u201cbut rather of an ', other',  aura evolving from the remainder of the here and now after its deconstruction\u2026 My ', architecture',  holds that ', architecture',  could write something else\u201d (Eisenman 17). If nothing else, Eisenman  reflects the continuing need to answer to Benjamin, and thus his  continuing importance.',

', NOTES', 
', i',  Due to ambiguity over the ', translation',  of               the German (\u201cDas Kunstwerk im Zeitalter seiner technischen               Reproduzierbarkeit\u201d should have been translated as, \u201cThe               Work of Art in the Age of Its Technical Reproducibility\u201d).               Miriam Hansen and Susan Buck-Morss have taken to calling this the \u201cArtwork               Essay.\u201d The word \u2018', aura', \u2018 is also the               word that is used by Benjamin in the original German; this is not               an approximated ', translation', .', 
', ii',  It\u2019s worth noting that the word aura does               not come from the same Latin cognate as aureola, the technical               term for the halo that in medieval Christian imagery surrounds               the head of Christ. Aura refers to an               emanation or a breeze; aureola\u2019s cognate is aureolum, which refers               to the ', color',  of gold. Aureola moreover               refers only to halos around the head; holy emanations from the ', body',  of               Christ at large are nimbuses (OED).',

				', \u201cSome company recently was interested in buying my \u2018aura,\u2019 they didn\u2019t want my product.\u201d    \u2014 Andy Warhol, ', The Philosophy of Andy Warhol', 
', The word ', aura',  dates to antiquity (Latin, \u2018breath\u2019 or \u2018breeze;  later, \u2018a subtle emanation from any substance\u2019) and has been used in  numerous ways, not least to describe the existence of electromagnetic  fields around the human ', body',  (OED). Although this usage predates Walter Benjamin\u2019s 1936 essay \u201cThe Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,\u201d ', i',  the use of the term in contemporary media studies is dominated by the  specter of Benjamin and by his elaboration of the term here and in his  work on the storyteller and Baudelaire. \u2018Aura\u2019 refers to the authority  held by the unique, original work, which under modernity is liquidated  by the techniques of mass reproduction. This involvement with ', authenticity',  and reproduction squarely ensconces Benjamin in an older debate over  the nature of the original and the copy, which dates to Plato and  continues through today in (amongst others) ', Jean Baudrillard',  and Gilles Deleuze.  Benjamin\u2019s entrypoint to aura is his concern with technical  reproducibility. Aura for him refers first and foremostly to a certain  kind of ', aesthetic',  ', presence',  of art, grounded in religious experience, and eliminated by the modern development of the ', technologies',  of reproduction\u2013photography and especially ', film', .  Aura also, however, refers to the model of a certain kind of  intersubjective experience, in the experience of an object gazing back  at one. In this way Benjamin means to approach both ', aesthetics',  and ethics and, in doing so, to approach what mass media might mean as  the grounds for a revolutionary politics. As Miriam Hansen argues,  however, the tension in Benjamin between the liberatory potential of  mass media and the vulgarity it represents is never fully resolved  (Hansen 187).', 
', 1. Aura, Presence, Politics', 
The aura of a work issues from the ', presence',  it has: from being situated squarely in a particular ', space',  and having a certain history, or in other words, its ', authenticity', .  The ceiling of the Sistine Chapel has an aura\u2013and an authority\u2013which  derives not only from its formal qualities but the fact of its being in  the Vatican, having lasted five centuries, having been painted by the  hand of Michelangelo, and even more than that, that it cannot ever be  duplicated. A replica of an entire Dutch village has been built in the  south of Japan but it is throughly ', without aura', : it lacks the tradition of the former, the history of the former, it is ersatz and in this sense ', inauthentic', . As Benjamin writes, \u201cEven the most perfect reproduction of a work of art is lacking in one element: its ', presence',  in ', time',  and ', space', ,  its unique existence at the place where it happens to be (Benjamin  220).\u201d Under modernity aura becomes degraded: in the proliferation of  reproductions, the authority of the original is obliterated. To be sure,  ', technologies',  of reproduction have always existed. But for Benjamin there is a  categorical difference between the reproduction the Greeks were capable  of and the technical reproduction we are capable of. Inherent in the  medium of ', photography',  is the process of reproduction: a negative can be used to produce an  infinite number of prints, none of which can really be called an  \u2018original.\u2019 ', Technologies',  such as the lithograph and the photograph allow the work of art to be  reproduced endlessly, and not only reproduced\u2013but allow it to be ', seen better', ,  as in process reproduction, which can enlarge an original. Reproduction  can also transport the original to \u201csituations where it would be out of  reach for the original itself (Benjamin 220),\u201d for example, when the  Sistine Chapel is reproduced in middle school civilizations textbooks.  The ', aura',  that issues from apprehending the Sistine Chapel in the state of its  history, in the Vatican, dissipates with each reproduction. As Benjamin  writes, \u201c[T]he technique of reproduction detaches the reproduced object  from the domain of tradition,\u201d which is to say, it takes the object out  of the ', time',  and place in which it was made. Reproductions are not just other objects: they degrade the ', aura',  of the original.', 
', But while aura is to be found in ', authenticity', , Benjamin is very careful to tether it to religious life ', ii', .  Benjamin being a certain kind of Marxist, the destruction of aura\u2013and  the progression of history\u2013cannot be read in elegiac terms: the end of  aura is also the end of the ritual and political structures which  surround aura. \u201c[T]he unique value of the \u2018authentic\u2019 work of art has  its basis in ritual, the location of its original use value\u2026 for the  first ', time',  in world history, mechanical reproduction emancipates the work of art  from its parasitical dependence on ritual\u201d (Benjamin 224). The  destruction of aura in \u201cThe Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical  Reproduction\u201d is also the destruction of a certain kind of social  organization which propagates it in the first place. The unspoken debt  in Benjamin\u2019s discussion of ritual is to Durkheim and his discussion, in  ', The Elementary Forms of Religious Life', , of ', mana',  (to which ', aura',  is closely tied, as it is a power from which authority issues) and to  his affirmation of the hierarchical nature of early societies. The new  technologies of mechanical reproducibility are above all, then,  emancipatory technologies: mass culture is positioned as a kind of  democratization when, as under the regime of mechanical reproducibility,  the authentic original disappears, and the legitimation of political  resistance thus becomes unnecessary. Benjamin self-consciously means for  \u201cThe Work of Art\u2026\u201d to function as a political exhortation: \u201cThe  concepts which are introduced into the theory of art in what follows\u2026  are useful for the formulation of revolutionary demands in the politics  of art,\u201d he proclaims. Aura is an aesthetic experience; but above all,  for Benjamin, the liquidation of aura is a kind of political  emancipation. In the age of technical reproduction, the authentic,  original ', image',  or document ', cannot',  exist; asking the question of ', authenticity',  of a Microsoft Word document is for Benjamin incomprehensible. \u201cThe instant the criterion of ', authenticity',  ceases to be applicable to artistic production, the total function of  art is reversed. Instead of being based on ritual, it begins to be based  on another practice\u2013politics (Benjamin 224).\u201d The politics of ', aura',  under premodernity are such that the work of art is out of reach for most people: the reliquaries of the church and the ', Kunstkammern',  of the German princes are closed to the eyes of the public. In the reproduction of works of art\u2013in ', photography',  and in ', film',  and in print\u2013there is a radical accessibility at work, which for  Benjamin opens up the possibility of finding in the work of art a place  for revolution.', 
', But while true aura dissipates under modernity, Benjamin does  note that it resurfaces in mass culture as a kind of dream image: it is  refigured, as pastiche, in the production of mass culture. One example  of this refiguring would be Ikea furniture design: the design of an  eccentric and homely chair is meant specifically to elide or gloss the  enormous global distribution networks from which it emerges. Susan  Buck-Morss describes the habit of buying covers and boxes and packages  for our bought objects, by which we seem to want to make a home for them  (Buck-Morss 184). Aura, thus, resurfaces in its dissolution as ersatz  tragicomedy; and more than this, Benjamin has through asserting this  foreclosed absolutely on the possibility of any kind of restoration of  the mystery and distance of the world, of traditional notions of  subjectivity, by working through the structures of capital. If one is to  formulate a revolutionary politics based on mass culture it cannot be  predicated on finding a home within mass culture.', 
', One might argue, however, that the conception of aura which I  have just presented is as unstable as its namesake: as Miriam Hansen  argues in \u201cBenjamin, Cinema, and Experience: \u2018The Blue Flower in the ', Land',  of ', Technology', u",'\u201d Benjamin\u2019s conception of aura, when ", mapped',  against the theory of experience as found in his work on Baudelaire and  on storytelling, is \u2018profoundly ambivalent\u2019 (Hansen 187). In \u201cThe  Storyteller,\u201d for example, Benjamin decries the devaluing of  \u2018experience\u2019, and ennobles the teller of stories: \u201cExperience has fallen  in value\u2026 Every glance at a ', newspaper',  demonstrates that it has reached a new low\u2026 (Benjamin 83-84)\u201d It  should be clear that this is an entirely different tack than is taken in  the ebullient optimism of \u201cThe Work of Art\u2026,\u201d that what is being  decried here is in fact that which the other essay takes as the new  direction for revolutionary politics. Aura is by no means a unitary  concept unto itself for Benjamin and his ambivalent oscillation between  the emancipatory possibilities of mass culture and the sense of mass  culture\u2019s degradation remains a problem for contemporary media studies.  To some extent Benjamin\u2019s work in mass culture can be read as a  predecessor of ', Jean Baudrillard', , who writes in ', Simulacra and Simulation', :  \u201cSimulation is no longer that of a territory, a referential being, or a  substance. It is the generation by models of a real without origin or  reality: a hyperreal (Baudrillard 1).\u201d In this sense Benjamin\u2019s  assertion that the original under technical reproduction ceases to exist  is taken to its most extreme in Baudrillard, in which the  disintegration of the original has been such that it is no longer, even,  a point of reference. The hyperreal spins off reproductions endlessly,  without grounding. (See also articles on simulation, simulacrum: ', 1', , ', 2', ).', 
', 2. Returning the Gaze', 
If one aspect of the aura was the question of its uniqueness, another is  the way it is ensconced in a certain kind of subjectivity. \u2018Aura\u2019  implies a relation between the object and the ', spectator', u" which, for Benjamin, is a relation characterized by distance. \u201cWe  define the aura of [natural objects] as the unique phenomenon of a  distance, however close it may be. If, while resting on a summer  afternoon, you follow with your eyes a mountain range on the horizon or a  branch which casts its shadow over you, you experience the aura of  those mountains, of that branch (Benjamin 222-223).\u201d This idea of  contemplation, important for Benjamin\u2019s conception of what conditions  are necessary for critique to be possible, thus implies a certain kind  of distance and a certain kind of subjectivity. As Susan Buck-Morss  rejoins to this, \u201cCharacteristic of aura, despite its \u2018unique phenomenon  of distance,\u2019 was the sense that \u2018the gaze is returned (Buck-Morss  194).'\u201d If one were ever to find an ambivalence in Benjamin it would be  here: for Benjamin, in the watching of a ", film',  one relates not to the ', face',  of the actor (who is directed towards an infinite number of spectators ', ad infinitum', ),  but to the camera. In saying this he means to call attention to the  technical medium, which enacts a generalized degradation. This is,  however, the same medium by which he hopes to launch a platform for a  radical politics. Inasmuch as the concept ennobles ', authenticity', ,  it places Benjamin squarely on one side of a debate which dates back to  Plato\u2013which is to say that in this position, Benjamin is making a  certain claim about the degradation and inadequacy of the copy, famously  explicated in Plato\u2019s \u201cAllegory of the Cave,\u201d although the issue of  \u2018the modern break\u2019 for him looms large in a way which it does not for  his ancient forebearer. Yet it also ennobles a certain kind of politics  which lead ultimately to the very unseating of the mechanics of  reproducibility.', 
', 3. Aura since Benjamin', 
', Despite the fact that at the ', time',  of its conceptualization, aura was for Benjamin a concept withering  under duress, it remains important for its engagement with issues which  remain front and center for art historical ', discourse', , especially as regards ', authenticity', . Rosalind Krauss et al in ', Art Since 1900',  describes Donald Judd as attempting very baldly to eradicate any sense  of \u2018aura\u2019, by which is meant the hand of the artist, the uniqueness of a  particular piece. In a 1990 public letter to Jacques Derrida, the  architect Peter Eisenman writes of the need in ', architecture',  to ', create',  auras, which he glosses as \u201cthe possibility of a presentness of  something else\u201d (Eisenman 17), or in other words, a gesturing into the  beyond, an open-endedness. \u201cBut I am not talking about this kind of  Benjaminian aura\u2013the aura of metaphysical fullness,\u201d Eisenman is quick  to rejoin, \u201cbut rather of an ', other',  aura evolving from the remainder of the here and now after its deconstruction\u2026 My ', architecture',  holds that ', architecture',  could write something else\u201d (Eisenman 17). If nothing else, Eisenman  reflects the continuing need to answer to Benjamin, and thus his  continuing importance.',

', NOTES', 
', i',  Due to ambiguity over the ', translation',  of               the German (\u201cDas Kunstwerk im Zeitalter seiner technischen               Reproduzierbarkeit\u201d should have been translated as, \u201cThe               Work of Art in the Age of Its Technical Reproducibility\u201d).               Miriam Hansen and Susan Buck-Morss have taken to calling this the \u201cArtwork               Essay.\u201d The word \u2018', aura', \u2018 is also the               word that is used by Benjamin in the original German; this is not               an approximated ', translation', .', 
', ii',  It\u2019s worth noting that the word aura does               not come from the same Latin cognate as aureola, the technical               term for the halo that in medieval Christian imagery surrounds               the head of Christ. Aura refers to an               emanation or a breeze; aureola\u2019s cognate is aureolum, which refers               to the ', color',  of gold. Aureola moreover               refers only to halos around the head; holy emanations from the ', body',  of               Christ at large are nimbuses (OED).',
