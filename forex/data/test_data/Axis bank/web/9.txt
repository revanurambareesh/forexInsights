March 3, 2017  Hi Ankur, it is necessary to have your Registered Mobile Number SIM card in the device on which the app is being installed for security of your account. A registered mobile number is the one that is registered with the bank for SMS Banking. You will not be able to register in case the SIM for a non-registered mobile number is present in the device.                  Gopinathh R  March 9, 2017                       During first 3days of the app installation, we can able to do txn upto 30,000 INR. This should be informed during txn. Because, after installing we were trying to do txn which shows the error saying "your daily txn limit exceeded." Instead of showing this error, It should exactly show the msg saying, on the first 3 days u can do only this much. It would be better. Pl consider this.
