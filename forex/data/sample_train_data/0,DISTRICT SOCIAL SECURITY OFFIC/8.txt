        ', I came here to replace my card and everyone here is super helpful and super welcoming. I was lost and didn't know what I would need but the guard walk me through the steps and asked me to go through the next room . From there I just waited about 15 min. 

The time I was there, it was not pack so I guess I came in lucky! When my number was called, I went to the designated window and spoke to a man. He was my interviewer and was friendly! His question was "what can I do for you today ?" And listen well I explain what I came for. Quickly, he help me and ask for my driver license. After that, he printed my receipt and I was done! Super friendly, fast and nice! Did not ever expect that! Thanks!',

First off, the parking lot is a nightmare, and did not have enough parking to accommodate the number of people that visit this place. I was able to parallel park to the side.
When I walked in, there were so many people. They have kiosks to check in and get a number. I was Z364. When I looked at the screen, they were on Z250. What???? There was also a loudspeaker where you could hear a muffled voice calling numbers if you were lucky enough to hear it. 
I followed the signs to the social security card area, and that room was packed too! I left to get lunch.
When I came back they had made it to Z290. What?  

Then there was a turn of events. There was a lady who came out and started calling people in increments of 10. I guess a lot of people get tired and leave at that point in the day. It was around 1:45. Everything moved quickly. The lady who helped me was friendly and efficient, and in about 5 minutes, I was on my way....to the DMV, but that is another story. 

2 stars for service, but they should allow you to check in ahead of time online so that you don't have to wait so long.",

How long does it take to get your name changed at the Social Security Office? Only 5 measly minutes. But how long is the wait to get your name changed? A whopping 2 hours and 40 minutes! Yes, people, it's an alllllllllllllll-day affair. 

I got married over two months ago and have been putting off the legal name change for this very reason: the dreaded wait time. I went in expecting the worst, but I didn't realize just how bad it was. Chaotic, not enough seating, long never ending lines.

They have electronic kiosks at the front of the office where you check in. I did just that and grabbed a seat. After an hour of waiting, I heard a security guard announce that if you were simply seeking a replacement card or a name change, you can go to another waiting room down the hall. Thinking it would be much faster from there, I was mistaken. Another hour and a half.

My advice-- come equipped and ready to pass the time. Bring your laptop, your phone charger, a book, snacks and water. And don't come during the first week of the month-- a nightmare on top of an already atrocious waiting time.

Why the extra star? I will say that the staff was extremely helpful and friendly despite the chaos. I noticed a security guard giving a young kid candy and patiently assisting an elderly woman. The staff was completely overworked but friendly all around.  I felt bad for these conditions they have to deal with daily.",

Taking into perspective that this is a government office, my experiences here were not too terrible. It doesn't seem to be too overcrowded considering its centralized location. There is a small little division specifically for people who need SS cards - this is where I'm always hanging out every time I lose my card. When I came here about a week ago, my wait was just a little over an hour, and it consistently stays that way. Bring a book or a phone to stare at to make time flow faster. I did both. Oh, and I was reading "A New Earth" by Eckert Tolle on my last visit. This is probably why I was kind of zen. Look it up, if you don't get what I'm talking about. It can potentially alter your perspective on reality, and perhaps, make you zen during the daunting wait in close proximity to the people you don't want to sit next to.

Anyway, I think I just jinxed my Social Security Office experience. Now I should be extra, extra secure about my card.',

I went there to get my name changed and my birthday changed since apparently, I have been 10 days older than I actually am in the federal government's eyes. Talk about premature aging. We got our number. We waited. We heard babies cry and watched as one helpless ssa staffer made the mistake of stepping out into the floor, open to be swarmed by jittery, anxious, ss card seekers. Those people will do anything for a card. Our number was called. We had an Asian lady who quickly worked on all of our changes and just like that, we were out the door and into our car in just under an hour.

My number was called but I heard Window L so I went to that window and the lady at the window with the rudest tone tells me "I didn't call you" and so I went to another window asking did someone call Z154 and she tells me you will be window O and when I get there the doors are shut and no one is there. It was ridiculous but luckily one of the nicer staff member helps me out and took care of me.

I was pretty terrified when I printed out my number (which was in the 70s) and realized they were only in the teens. I glanced wistfully at my phone, and shed a silent tear that I only had 20% left, and wondered what the hell I was going to do without Ninja Fishing for the next 17 hours I would be stuck there.

                ', u"I came here to replace my card and everyone here is super helpful and super welcoming. I was lost and didn't know what I would need but the guard walk me through the steps and asked me to go through the next room . From there I just waited about 15 min. ", The time I was there, it was not pack so I guess I came in lucky! When my number was called, I went to the designated window and spoke to a man. He was my interviewer and was friendly! His question was "what can I do for you today ?" And listen well I explain what I came for. Quickly, he help me and ask for my driver license. After that, he printed my receipt and I was done! Super friendly, fast and nice! Did not ever expect that! Thanks!',

                ', There has to be a better way for a name change. I recently went to the SS office to get a replacement card with my married name when I had a free afternoon. I arrived around 12:15pm, and the place was packed. I am guessing a lot of people try to go on their lunch breaks.', First off, the parking lot is a nightmare, and did not have enough parking to accommodate the number of people that visit this place. I was able to parallel park to the side.', When I walked in, there were so many people. They have kiosks to check in and get a number. I was Z364. When I looked at the screen, they were on Z250. What???? There was also a loudspeaker where you could hear a muffled voice calling numbers if you were lucky enough to hear it. ', I followed the signs to the social security card area, and that room was packed too! I left to get lunch.', When I came back they had made it to Z290. What?  ', Then there was a turn of events. There was a lady who came out and started calling people in increments of 10. I guess a lot of people get tired and leave at that point in the day. It was around 1:45. Everything moved quickly. The lady who helped me was friendly and efficient, and in about 5 minutes, I was on my way....to the DMV, but that is another story. ', u"2 stars for service, but they should allow you to check in ahead of time online so that you don't have to wait so long.",

                ', I went in at noon and did not come out until almost 3:00PM. ', u"How long does it take to get your name changed at the Social Security Office? Only 5 measly minutes. But how long is the wait to get your name changed? A whopping 2 hours and 40 minutes! Yes, people, it's an alllllllllllllll-day affair. ", u"I got married over two months ago and have been putting off the legal name change for this very reason: the dreaded wait time. I went in expecting the worst, but I didn't realize just how bad it was. Chaotic, not enough seating, long never ending lines.", They have electronic kiosks at the front of the office where you check in. I did just that and grabbed a seat. After an hour of waiting, I heard a security guard announce that if you were simply seeking a replacement card or a name change, you can go to another waiting room down the hall. Thinking it would be much faster from there, I was mistaken. Another hour and a half.', u"My advice-- come equipped and ready to pass the time. Bring your laptop, your phone charger, a book, snacks and water. And don't come during the first week of the month-- a nightmare on top of an already atrocious waiting time.", Why the extra star? I will say that the staff was extremely helpful and friendly despite the chaos. I noticed a security guard giving a young kid candy and patiently assisting an elderly woman. The staff was completely overworked but friendly all around.  I felt bad for these conditions they have to deal with daily.',

                ', u"I only visit this place when I need a replacement card. I'm afraid to admit the number of visits because it's been a lot. It's surprising my identity hasn't been stolen yet. Maybe it has - I just don't know...", Taking into perspective that this is a government office, my experiences here were not too terrible. It doesn't seem to be too overcrowded considering its centralized location. There is a small little division specifically for people who need SS cards - this is where I'm always hanging out every time I lose my card. When I came here about a week ago, my wait was just a little over an hour, and it consistently stays that way. Bring a book or a phone to stare at to make time flow faster. I did both. Oh, and I was reading "A New Earth" by Eckert Tolle on my last visit. This is probably why I was kind of zen. Look it up, if you don't get what I'm talking about. It can potentially alter your perspective on reality, and perhaps, make you zen during the daunting wait in close proximity to the people you don't want to sit next to.', Anyway, I think I just jinxed my Social Security Office experience. Now I should be extra, extra secure about my card.',

                ', u"I've been twice in the past year (initially for name change, then today for a lost card). Both times, I've gotten to the office around 8:30am. There have been lines outside designated to replacement cards, and claiming social security checks/filing for SS benefits. This morning, by 8:50, everyone had been assigned a number, and while I was halfway down the line, I was sent to one of the cubicles immediately. The gentleman that helped me was very nice, and efficient. I was out the door at 9:10am. ", u"My past experience was the exact same.

                ', What can one say about a Social Security office? The place didn't smell of dead bodies. The carpet seemed clean enough. There were clear signs pointing everyone to the right direction. The security guards did a great job at securing. They had two holding pens for us humans which was nice. This must be what "free range" chickens feel like.', u"I went there to get my name changed and my birthday changed since apparently, I have been 10 days older than I actually am in the federal government's eyes. Talk about premature aging. We got our number. We waited. We heard babies cry and watched as one helpless ssa staffer made the mistake of stepping out into the floor, open to be swarmed by jittery, anxious, ss card seekers. Those people will do anything for a card. Our number was called. We had an Asian lady who quickly worked on all of our changes and just like that, we were out the door and into our car in just under an hour. ", Thank you for a great time, SSA. You sure know how to get sh*t done.',

I was nice about it and walked away because it was obviously a wackass attempt at flirting by the guard. And another guard just kept staring at me. bring another pair of nostrils and plenty to keep you busy and snacks for while you wait. The clerk was awesome and the 3 stars are for him.

I've been here several times and only two or three times was I was met by someone who appeared to care but the rest of the time the attendants seemed annoyed and frustrated and it makes for a very anxious and uncomfortable meeting. They are very impatient and it makes you feel dumb because you don't know the system inside out like they do but if yore just an average person like me who's not trying to screw Social Security or trying to get money that yore not really entitled to, it's stressful and I would avoid it if at all possible.",

                ', Considering The amount of time I had to wait, an hour and a half, and without an appointment, my experience was excellent.  The man who helped us, Mr. J. Cardona, was very helpful, professional, and pleasant.  He answered all of my questions as well as those of my spouse.  For all that is said about the Social Security Administration, I think they are doing a great job. Congratulations to the Dallas office!',

                ', I guess this is expected at a Social security office but my experience here was horrific. I got in around 11:00 and out around 12:30 not too bad. However when they call your number on the intercom it's so difficult to hear some of the staff members who have heavy accents or who may be soft spoken. My number was called but I heard Window L so I went to that window and the lady at the window with the rudest tone tells me "I didn't call you" and so I went to another window asking did someone call Z154 and she tells me you will be window O and when I get there the doors are shut and no one is there. It was ridiculous but luckily one of the nicer staff member helps me out and took care of me. If it wasn't for that one staff member I'm terrified to think that I could have sat around for another hour and a half for my new number to be called. I hope that I never have to come here again.',

                ', I feel a little ridiculous reviewing a social security office on Yelp but I was so pleasantly surprised I had to review! I got there at 1 on a Friday to change my name after getting married, and I was out by 2:30. The agent was kind and helpful and the line and process efficient!',

After they opened the doors and have me a ticket, I was out of there at 9:09!!! I can't speak to the wait times of yore there for anything other than a replacement card but I am really happy with this office's efficiency today.",

                ', What a freaking nightmare!  They open at 9am. I got there at 8:30 thinking I would be the first person there! HA! There were over 600 people lined outside around the building. I went in just to see once they opened the door and I have never seen so many people crammed in such a small place in all my life! Never again!  Ever!  Doing everything online!  Plus it was hot in there and stunk from all the sweaty people standing in line outside for God knows how long!   Can we say onions and Mexican food!',

                ', "Oh, yore going to the social security office? Tell me how you hate your life."', That was the response I got from EVERYONE when I mentioned I had to trek my ass out to order a replacement card. But this place is maybe the cleanest, nicest, best staffed government agency I have EVER been to. ', I was pretty terrified when I printed out my number (which was in the 70s) and realized they were only in the teens. I glanced wistfully at my phone, and shed a silent tear that I only had 20% left, and wondered what the hell I was going to do without Ninja Fishing for the next 17 hours I would be stuck there. ', u"Then, a highly efficient guy with a walkie talkie came in and started rattling off numbers like an auctioneer, sending people this way and that, and even smiling and cracking jokes. Wait, you don't hate your job? Yore not hellbent on making everyone stuck in this room wish they were on the business end of a shotgun? Am I in the twilight zone? ", u"I arrived at 1:15pm, and was out the door with a smile on my face and a spring in my step by 1:40 flat.  I don't know what the do here, but whatever it is, let's share it with the DPS. Cause that place makes hell look like a Jamaican vacation.",

Also, be prepared to have you sense if smell assaulted by large amounts of B.O. from the number of non-English speaking "citizens" that don't seem to know how to use deodorant. Typical government agency. No cares given here.',

        ', I came here to replace my card and everyone here is super helpful and super welcoming. I was lost and didn't know what I would need but the guard walk me through the steps and asked me to go through the next room . From there I just waited about 15 min. 

The time I was there, it was not pack so I guess I came in lucky! When my number was called, I went to the designated window and spoke to a man. He was my interviewer and was friendly! His question was "what can I do for you today ?" And listen well I explain what I came for. Quickly, he help me and ask for my driver license. After that, he printed my receipt and I was done! Super friendly, fast and nice! Did not ever expect that! Thanks!',

First off, the parking lot is a nightmare, and did not have enough parking to accommodate the number of people that visit this place. I was able to parallel park to the side.
When I walked in, there were so many people. They have kiosks to check in and get a number. I was Z364. When I looked at the screen, they were on Z250. What???? There was also a loudspeaker where you could hear a muffled voice calling numbers if you were lucky enough to hear it. 
I followed the signs to the social security card area, and that room was packed too! I left to get lunch.
When I came back they had made it to Z290. What?  

Then there was a turn of events. There was a lady who came out and started calling people in increments of 10. I guess a lot of people get tired and leave at that point in the day. It was around 1:45. Everything moved quickly. The lady who helped me was friendly and efficient, and in about 5 minutes, I was on my way....to the DMV, but that is another story. 

2 stars for service, but they should allow you to check in ahead of time online so that you don't have to wait so long.",

How long does it take to get your name changed at the Social Security Office? Only 5 measly minutes. But how long is the wait to get your name changed? A whopping 2 hours and 40 minutes! Yes, people, it's an alllllllllllllll-day affair. 

I got married over two months ago and have been putting off the legal name change for this very reason: the dreaded wait time. I went in expecting the worst, but I didn't realize just how bad it was. Chaotic, not enough seating, long never ending lines.

They have electronic kiosks at the front of the office where you check in. I did just that and grabbed a seat. After an hour of waiting, I heard a security guard announce that if you were simply seeking a replacement card or a name change, you can go to another waiting room down the hall. Thinking it would be much faster from there, I was mistaken. Another hour and a half.

My advice-- come equipped and ready to pass the time. Bring your laptop, your phone charger, a book, snacks and water. And don't come during the first week of the month-- a nightmare on top of an already atrocious waiting time.

Why the extra star? I will say that the staff was extremely helpful and friendly despite the chaos. I noticed a security guard giving a young kid candy and patiently assisting an elderly woman. The staff was completely overworked but friendly all around.  I felt bad for these conditions they have to deal with daily.",

Taking into perspective that this is a government office, my experiences here were not too terrible. It doesn't seem to be too overcrowded considering its centralized location. There is a small little division specifically for people who need SS cards - this is where I'm always hanging out every time I lose my card. When I came here about a week ago, my wait was just a little over an hour, and it consistently stays that way. Bring a book or a phone to stare at to make time flow faster. I did both. Oh, and I was reading "A New Earth" by Eckert Tolle on my last visit. This is probably why I was kind of zen. Look it up, if you don't get what I'm talking about. It can potentially alter your perspective on reality, and perhaps, make you zen during the daunting wait in close proximity to the people you don't want to sit next to.

Anyway, I think I just jinxed my Social Security Office experience. Now I should be extra, extra secure about my card.',

This morning, by 8:50, everyone had been assigned a number, and while I was halfway down the line, I was sent to one of the cubicles immediately.

The security guards did a great job at securing. They had two holding pens for us humans which was nice. This must be what "free range" chickens feel like.

I went there to get my name changed and my birthday changed since apparently, I have been 10 days older than I actually am in the federal government's eyes. Talk about premature aging. We got our number. We waited. We heard babies cry and watched as one helpless ssa staffer made the mistake of stepping out into the floor, open to be swarmed by jittery, anxious, ss card seekers. Those people will do anything for a card. Our number was called. We had an Asian lady who quickly worked on all of our changes and just like that, we were out the door and into our car in just under an hour. 

Thank you for a great time, SSA. You sure know how to get sh*t done.',

However when they call your number on the intercom it's so difficult to hear some of the staff members who have heavy accents or who may be soft spoken. My number was called but I heard Window L so I went to that window and the lady at the window with the rudest tone tells me "I didn't call you" and so I went to another window asking did someone call Z154 and she tells me you will be window O and when I get there the doors are shut and no one is there. It was ridiculous but luckily one of the nicer staff member helps me out and took care of me.

I was pretty terrified when I printed out my number (which was in the 70s) and realized they were only in the teens. I glanced wistfully at my phone, and shed a silent tear that I only had 20% left, and wondered what the hell I was going to do without Ninja Fishing for the next 17 hours I would be stuck there. 

Then, a highly efficient guy with a walkie talkie came in and started rattling off numbers like an auctioneer, sending people this way and that, and even smiling and cracking jokes. Wait, you don't hate your job? Yore not hellbent on making everyone stuck in this room wish they were on the business end of a shotgun? Am I in the twilight zone?

                ', u"I came here to replace my card and everyone here is super helpful and super welcoming. I was lost and didn't know what I would need but the guard walk me through the steps and asked me to go through the next room . From there I just waited about 15 min. ", The time I was there, it was not pack so I guess I came in lucky! When my number was called, I went to the designated window and spoke to a man. He was my interviewer and was friendly! His question was "what can I do for you today ?" And listen well I explain what I came for. Quickly, he help me and ask for my driver license. After that, he printed my receipt and I was done! Super friendly, fast and nice! Did not ever expect that! Thanks!',

                ', There has to be a better way for a name change. I recently went to the SS office to get a replacement card with my married name when I had a free afternoon. I arrived around 12:15pm, and the place was packed. I am guessing a lot of people try to go on their lunch breaks.', First off, the parking lot is a nightmare, and did not have enough parking to accommodate the number of people that visit this place. I was able to parallel park to the side.', When I walked in, there were so many people. They have kiosks to check in and get a number. I was Z364. When I looked at the screen, they were on Z250. What???? There was also a loudspeaker where you could hear a muffled voice calling numbers if you were lucky enough to hear it. ', I followed the signs to the social security card area, and that room was packed too! I left to get lunch.', When I came back they had made it to Z290. What?  ', Then there was a turn of events. There was a lady who came out and started calling people in increments of 10. I guess a lot of people get tired and leave at that point in the day. It was around 1:45. Everything moved quickly. The lady who helped me was friendly and efficient, and in about 5 minutes, I was on my way....to the DMV, but that is another story. ', u"2 stars for service, but they should allow you to check in ahead of time online so that you don't have to wait so long.",

                ', I went in at noon and did not come out until almost 3:00PM. ', u"How long does it take to get your name changed at the Social Security Office? Only 5 measly minutes. But how long is the wait to get your name changed? A whopping 2 hours and 40 minutes! Yes, people, it's an alllllllllllllll-day affair. ", u"I got married over two months ago and have been putting off the legal name change for this very reason: the dreaded wait time. I went in expecting the worst, but I didn't realize just how bad it was. Chaotic, not enough seating, long never ending lines.", They have electronic kiosks at the front of the office where you check in. I did just that and grabbed a seat. After an hour of waiting, I heard a security guard announce that if you were simply seeking a replacement card or a name change, you can go to another waiting room down the hall. Thinking it would be much faster from there, I was mistaken. Another hour and a half.', u"My advice-- come equipped and ready to pass the time. Bring your laptop, your phone charger, a book, snacks and water. And don't come during the first week of the month-- a nightmare on top of an already atrocious waiting time.", Why the extra star? I will say that the staff was extremely helpful and friendly despite the chaos. I noticed a security guard giving a young kid candy and patiently assisting an elderly woman. The staff was completely overworked but friendly all around.  I felt bad for these conditions they have to deal with daily.',

                ', u"I only visit this place when I need a replacement card. I'm afraid to admit the number of visits because it's been a lot. It's surprising my identity hasn't been stolen yet. Maybe it has - I just don't know...", Taking into perspective that this is a government office, my experiences here were not too terrible. It doesn't seem to be too overcrowded considering its centralized location. There is a small little division specifically for people who need SS cards - this is where I'm always hanging out every time I lose my card. When I came here about a week ago, my wait was just a little over an hour, and it consistently stays that way. Bring a book or a phone to stare at to make time flow faster. I did both. Oh, and I was reading "A New Earth" by Eckert Tolle on my last visit. This is probably why I was kind of zen. Look it up, if you don't get what I'm talking about. It can potentially alter your perspective on reality, and perhaps, make you zen during the daunting wait in close proximity to the people you don't want to sit next to.', Anyway, I think I just jinxed my Social Security Office experience. Now I should be extra, extra secure about my card.',

                ', u"I've been twice in the past year (initially for name change, then today for a lost card). Both times, I've gotten to the office around 8:30am. There have been lines outside designated to replacement cards, and claiming social security checks/filing for SS benefits. This morning, by 8:50, everyone had been assigned a number, and while I was halfway down the line, I was sent to one of the cubicles immediately. The gentleman that helped me was very nice, and efficient. I was out the door at 9:10am. ", u"My past experience was the exact same.

                ', What can one say about a Social Security office? The place didn't smell of dead bodies. The carpet seemed clean enough. There were clear signs pointing everyone to the right direction. The security guards did a great job at securing. They had two holding pens for us humans which was nice. This must be what "free range" chickens feel like.', u"I went there to get my name changed and my birthday changed since apparently, I have been 10 days older than I actually am in the federal government's eyes. Talk about premature aging. We got our number. We waited. We heard babies cry and watched as one helpless ssa staffer made the mistake of stepping out into the floor, open to be swarmed by jittery, anxious, ss card seekers. Those people will do anything for a card. Our number was called. We had an Asian lady who quickly worked on all of our changes and just like that, we were out the door and into our car in just under an hour. ", Thank you for a great time, SSA. You sure know how to get sh*t done.',

I was nice about it and walked away because it was obviously a wackass attempt at flirting by the guard. And another guard just kept staring at me. bring another pair of nostrils and plenty to keep you busy and snacks for while you wait. The clerk was awesome and the 3 stars are for him.

I've been here several times and only two or three times was I was met by someone who appeared to care but the rest of the time the attendants seemed annoyed and frustrated and it makes for a very anxious and uncomfortable meeting. They are very impatient and it makes you feel dumb because you don't know the system inside out like they do but if yore just an average person like me who's not trying to screw Social Security or trying to get money that yore not really entitled to, it's stressful and I would avoid it if at all possible.",

                ', Considering The amount of time I had to wait, an hour and a half, and without an appointment, my experience was excellent.  The man who helped us, Mr. J. Cardona, was very helpful, professional, and pleasant.  He answered all of my questions as well as those of my spouse.  For all that is said about the Social Security Administration, I think they are doing a great job. Congratulations to the Dallas office!',

                ', I guess this is expected at a Social security office but my experience here was horrific. I got in around 11:00 and out around 12:30 not too bad. However when they call your number on the intercom it's so difficult to hear some of the staff members who have heavy accents or who may be soft spoken. My number was called but I heard Window L so I went to that window and the lady at the window with the rudest tone tells me "I didn't call you" and so I went to another window asking did someone call Z154 and she tells me you will be window O and when I get there the doors are shut and no one is there. It was ridiculous but luckily one of the nicer staff member helps me out and took care of me. If it wasn't for that one staff member I'm terrified to think that I could have sat around for another hour and a half for my new number to be called. I hope that I never have to come here again.',

                ', I feel a little ridiculous reviewing a social security office on Yelp but I was so pleasantly surprised I had to review! I got there at 1 on a Friday to change my name after getting married, and I was out by 2:30. The agent was kind and helpful and the line and process efficient!',

After they opened the doors and have me a ticket, I was out of there at 9:09!!! I can't speak to the wait times of yore there for anything other than a replacement card but I am really happy with this office's efficiency today.",

                ', What a freaking nightmare!  They open at 9am. I got there at 8:30 thinking I would be the first person there! HA! There were over 600 people lined outside around the building. I went in just to see once they opened the door and I have never seen so many people crammed in such a small place in all my life! Never again!  Ever!  Doing everything online!  Plus it was hot in there and stunk from all the sweaty people standing in line outside for God knows how long!   Can we say onions and Mexican food!',

                ', "Oh, yore going to the social security office? Tell me how you hate your life."', That was the response I got from EVERYONE when I mentioned I had to trek my ass out to order a replacement card. But this place is maybe the cleanest, nicest, best staffed government agency I have EVER been to. ', I was pretty terrified when I printed out my number (which was in the 70s) and realized they were only in the teens. I glanced wistfully at my phone, and shed a silent tear that I only had 20% left, and wondered what the hell I was going to do without Ninja Fishing for the next 17 hours I would be stuck there. ', u"Then, a highly efficient guy with a walkie talkie came in and started rattling off numbers like an auctioneer, sending people this way and that, and even smiling and cracking jokes. Wait, you don't hate your job? Yore not hellbent on making everyone stuck in this room wish they were on the business end of a shotgun? Am I in the twilight zone? ", u"I arrived at 1:15pm, and was out the door with a smile on my face and a spring in my step by 1:40 flat.  I don't know what the do here, but whatever it is, let's share it with the DPS. Cause that place makes hell look like a Jamaican vacation.",
