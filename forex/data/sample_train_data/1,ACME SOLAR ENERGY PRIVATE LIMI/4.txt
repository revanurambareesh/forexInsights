Potential impacts in construction activities besides being mitigable are likely to be limited to project site; short term; and not expected to impact environmentally sensitive areas. Further, it is possible to readily design and implement engineering and management measures to mitigate adverse impacts during construction and operations. The company will manage its environmental and social performance in accordance with applicable local laws and regulations and international standards, including IFC\u2019s Performance Standards on Social and Environmental Sustainability',
