    ', 
    ', Other information:', 
      The academic year begins March and ends in December. Registrations close on 30th June of the year proceeding the year of entry. However, late registrations are permissible along with a late fee, until September, when the entrance tests are conducted. For Indian students, and those Non-resident but able to make it, the entrance tests are conducted in   Delhi  (St. Stephen\u2019s College) and in Shimla.', 
      For Non-resident applicants unable to come to   India  in September we allow for the school in which the applicant is currently studying or the Indian Embassy/High Commission to invigilate the written test on our behalf. It is the parent\u2019s responsibility to negotiate this and obtain written consent for us. This notwithstanding, we prefer to meet the applicants at the time of the entrance test along with both parents. Offers for seats are usually sent out by the middle of October and acceptances are to be received at school by 15th November. If your son is a non-resident Indian he can take French as his second language.', 
    ', We would like to mention here that Bishop Cotton is a 150+ year-old school, quite steeped in tradition, where the discipline is hard and conditions spartan. We do not suit those who are used to a certain degree of luxury and comfort. one of the reasons why we are restrained with regard to registrations in the higher classes is because we often find that boys who join us late find it very much more difficult to adapt to the rigors of boarding life; unless they have been well prepared by their parents as to the reasons for them being sent to boarding school, and in the case of non-resident Indians, miles away from home.', 
      We are also wary of parental expectations, both, of the school and of how they wish for their children to grow. It would be a good idea to think over your decision about a boarding school and ensure that your son is very much a part of the decision making process. At Bishop Cotton we set great stress on commitment and do not expect ourselves, our children or our parents to go back on a commitment\u2026once you join, you are in till you finish year twelve and there are no soft options.',
