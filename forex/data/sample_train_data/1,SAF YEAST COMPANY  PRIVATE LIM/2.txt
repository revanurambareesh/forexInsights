', PER DINESH KUMAR AGARWAL, J.M.
', 
',       These cross appeals by the assessee and the Revenue are directed

against the order dtd. 15-5-2007 passed by the ld. CIT(A), Kolhapur for

the A.Y. 2004-05. Both these appeals are disposed of by this common

order for the sake of convenience.

', u"2.    Briefly stated facts of the case are that the assessee company is

engaged in the manufacturing of bakers' yeast and carries on trading

activity of bakery related ingredients.   The return of income was filed

declaring total income of Rs. 1,62,08,636/- along with tax audit report,

other audit reports, P&L account and balance sheet.         The A.O. after

processing the return u/s 143(1) of the ", Income Tax Act', , 1961 (the Act) on

the same income as disclosed, selected the case for scrutiny and

accordingly issued notices u/s 143(2) and 142(1) of the Act. The A.O.
', 
', also issued a detail questionnaire calling for specific information on

various issues concerning the assessment. In response, the assessee

attended from time to time. However, the assessee has not furnished full

information as called for. Since the assessment was getting barred by

limitation, the A.O., in the absence of any other alternative, completed

the assessment on the basis of information available on record. The A.O.
', 
', after making the disallowance of depreciation of Rs. 95,094/-, out of

distribution expenses Rs. 93,38,903/-, out of professional charges Rs.
', 
', 45,73,390/-, foreign travel expenses Rs. 55,83,927/- and disallowance of

deduction u/s 80IA & 80IB of the Act completed the assessment at an

income of Rs. 14,46,84,040/- vide assessment order dtd, 27-12-2006

passed u/s 143(3) of the Act. On appeal, the ld. CIT(A) while confirming

the disallowance of depreciation and deduction u/s 80IA, deleted the

disallowance of professional charges, partly deleted the disallowance of

distribution expenses, foreign travel expenses and deduction u/s 80IB of

the Act.
', 

', 3.     Being aggrieved by the order of the ld. CIT(A) the assessee and the

Revenue both are in appeal before us.
', 

', 4.     The assessee is aggrieved by the sustenance of disallowance of

depreciation, deduction u/s 80IA & 80IB, distribution expenses and

foreign travelling expenses whereas the Revenue has challenged the relief

allowed by the ld. CIT(A) out of distribution expenses, professional

charges, foreign travel expenses and deduction u/s 80IA and 80IB of the

Act.
', 

', 5.     The assessee vide petition dtd. 12-9-2012 made a request for

admission of additional ground of appeal which reads as under:-
', 

',        "The ld. Commissioner of Income tax (Appeals) erred in confirming the
       assessment order under ', section 143(3)',  of the Income Tax Act passed on
       27-12-2006 without considering the fact that a search and seizure action
       on the appellant under ', section 132(1)',  of the Act was carried out on 30-
       11-2006, the pending assessment had already abated on the date of the
       search under the second proviso to ', Section 153A',  of the Act which
       therefore had to be quashed."
', 
', 6.     In the said petition it was submitted by the assessee that a search

and seizure action u/s 132(1) of the Act took place on the assessee on

30-11-2006 and on the date of the search the assessment for the A.Y.
', 
', 2004-05 was pending. However, the A.O. passed the assessment order

u/s. 143(3) on 27.12.2006 which had already abated as per the second

proviso to ', Section 153A',  of the Act. It was further submitted that after the
',                                       4         ITA No. 1074/PN/2007 &', 
                                               ITA No. 5182/Mum/2007



search, the A.O. issued notices under ', Section 153A',  for six assessment

years immediately preceding the assessment year relevant to the

previous year in which the search took place and accordingly the A.O.
', 
', passed the order u/s. 153A read with ', Section 143(3)',  for all these six

assessment years on 27.11.2008 including the year of the search and

seizure i.e. assessment year 2007-08. It was further submitted that the

assessee filed an appeal against the order u/s.153A read with ', Section

143(3)',  before the C.I.T. (Appeals) which is pending. It was further

submitted that since the assessment order for the A.Y. 2004-05 has been

passed after the search operation on 30.11.2006 in pursuance to the

pending assessment on that date, the same will not have any legal

validity and it is to be quashed. The reliance was also placed in ', Abhay

Kumar Shroff vs CIT and Ors', u" reported in (2007) 210 CTR (Jharkhand)

602 : (2007) 290 ITR 114 (Jharkhand). In the light of the above, it was

submitted that though the aforesaid additional ground was not raised

before the Id. C.I.T.(Appeals) and is now being raised before the Tribunal

for the first time, it is a pure question of law arising from the facts which

are on record in the assessment proceedings, therefore, the additional

ground may be admitted. For this purpose, the reliance was also placed

on the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of ", National

Thermal Power Co. Ltd. vs CIT',  (1998) 229 ITR 383 (SC) wherein it has

been held that "Undoubtedly, the Tribunal has the discretion to allow or

not to allow a new ground to be raised. But where the Tribunal is only
',                                      5        ITA No. 1074/PN/2007 &', 
                                             ITA No. 5182/Mum/2007



required to consider the question of law arising from facts which are on

record in the assessment proceedings, there is no reason why such a

question should not be allowed to be raised when it is necessary to

consider that question in order to correctly assess the tax liability of an

assessee." The reliance was also placed in the case of ', ITO vs M.M', .
', 
', Textiles reported in (2010) 122 I.T.D 435 (Mum) wherein it was held that

when additional legal grounds are raised, before the Tribunal after

obtaining leave from the Tribunal, such legal grounds should be accepted

by the Tribunal provided facts are on record in the assessment

proceedings. It was, therefore prayed that such additional ground be

admitted.
', 

', 7.    At the time of hearing the ld. Counsel for the assessee while

reiterating the same submissions as submitted in the petition dtd.
', 
', 12-9-2012 further submits that in view of the decision cited in the said

petition, the additional ground raised by the assessee be admitted. He

also placed on record a copy of the assessment order for the same A.Y.
', 
', i.e. A.Y. 2004-05 passed after the search u/s 153A r.w.s. 143(3) of the

Act dtd. 27-11-2008.
', 

', 8.    On merit of the additional ground of appeal, the ld. Counsel for the

assessee submits that there is no dispute that as on the date of search

i.e. on 30-11-2006 the assessment for the A.Y. 2004-05 was pending. In

other words as on the date of search, the pending assessment had
',                                       6       ITA No. 1074/PN/2007 &', 
                                             ITA No. 5182/Mum/2007



already abated under the second proviso to ', section 153A',  of the Act and,

therefore, the A.O. has grossly erred in passing the impugned

assessment u/s 143(3) of the Act dtd. 27-12-2006 which is liable to be

quashed and for this proposition, the reliance was also placed on the

following CBDT Circular and decisions:-
', 

',      (i)       Para No. 65.2 to 62.5 of CBDT Circular No. 7 of 2003 dtd.
',                5.9.2003,
',      (ii)      Abhay Kumar Shroff Vs. CIT (2007) 210 CTR (Jharkhand)
               602 : (2007) 290 ITR 114 (Jharkhand) : (2007) 162 TAXMAN
               429 (Jharkhand) [para 12 to 16).', 

',      (iii)     All Cargo Global Logistics Ltd. & Ors. Vs. DCIT (2012) 147
               TTJ (Mumbai)(SB) 513 : (2012) 137 ITD 287 (Mum) (SB)
               [para 52 and 53]

',      (iv)      CIT Vs. Anil Kumar Bhatia (2012) 24 taxmann.com 98(Delhi)
               [para 21]

',      (v)       CIT (Central) Kanpur Vs. Smt. Shaila Agarwal (2011) 16
               taxmann.com 232 (All.) : (2012) 346 ITR 130 (All.)



In the light of the above, he submits that the impugned regular

assessment passed by the A.O. is a nullity and, hence, the same may be

quashed.
', 

', 9.   On the other hand, the ld. D.R. while agreeing that the facts are

available on record, did not object to the admission of legal ground of

appeal.      He further submits that in the subsequent assessment order

passed by the A.O. u/s 153A r.w.s. 143(3) of the Act, dtd. 27-11-2008,

the A.O. has made similar disallowance u/s 80IA, 80IB, distribution
',                                       7       ITA No. 1074/PN/2007 &', 
                                             ITA No. 5182/Mum/2007



expenses, foreign travelling expense to the extent as confirmed by the ld.
', 
', CIT(A) and disallowance of staff welfare expense as per assessment order

dtd. 27-11-2008 (supra), therefore, in the interest of justice, the said

disallowance made by the A.O. may remain to be considered as made in

the assessment order u/s 153A r.w.s. 143(3) of the Act.
', 

', 10.   We have carefully considered the submission of the rival parties

and perused the material available on record. We find that the facts are

not in dispute inasmuch as it is also not in dispute that in this case a

search and seizure action u/s 132(1) of the Act was taken place on the

assessee on 30-11-2006 and on the date of search the assessment for

the year under consideration i.e. A.Y. 2004-05 was pending and the

same assessment order was passed by the A.O. u/s 143(3) of the Act on

27-12-2006 i.e. after the date of search.
', 

', 11.   The assessee in the additional ground has challenged the validity

of the impugned assessment order on the ground that as on the date of

search i.e. on 30-11-2006, the pending assessment had already abated

under the second proviso to ', section 153A',  of the Act and in support he

placed on record the copy of the assessment order dtd. 27-11-2008

passed u/s 153A r.w.s. 143(3) of the Act and also relied on CBDT

Circular and various decisions (supra).
', 

', u"12.   A larger bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of

", National Thermal Power Co. Ltd. v. CIT',  [1998] 229 ITR 383 (SC)
',                                         8         ITA No. 1074/PN/2007 &', u"
                                                 ITA No. 5182/Mum/2007



observed that the question of law which arose from the fact as found by

the income-tax authority any legal issue can be raised at any stage. The

hon'ble Supreme Court observed that (page 387) :
", 

',       "where the Tribunal is only required to consider a question of law arising
      from the facts which are on record in the assessment proceedings we fail
      to see why such a question should not be allowed to be raised when it is
      necessary to consider that question in order to correctly assess the tax
      liability of an assessee".
', 

', 13.   Similarly in the case of ', CIT vs. Jai Parabolic Springs Ltd', . [2008]

206 ITR 42 (Delhi) it was observed that (headnote) :
', 

',       "..........that there was no prohibition on the powers of the Tribunal to
      entertain an additional ground which according to the Tribunal arose in
      the matter and for the just decision of the case. There was no infirmity in
      the order of the Tribunal."
', 

', 14.   It is also pertinent to mention that in the case of ', Jute Corporation

of India Ltd. v. CIT',  [1991] 187 ITR 688 (SC) it was observed that :
', 

',       "An appellate authority has all the powers which the original authority
      may have in deciding the question before it subject to the restrictions or
      limitations, if any, prescribed by the statutory provisions. In the absence
      of any statutory provision, the appellate authority is vested with all the
      plenary powers which the subordinate authority may have in the matter.
      There is no good reason to justify curtailment of the power of the
      Appellate Assistant Commissioner in entertaining an additional ground
      raised by the assessee in seeking modification of the order of assessment
      passed by the Income-tax Officer. There may be several factors justifying
      the raising of such a new plea in an appeal, and each case has to be
      considered on its own facts. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner must
      be satisfied that the ground raised was bonafide and that the same could
      not have been raised earlier for good reasons. Appellate Assistant
      Commissioner should exercise his discretion in permitting or not
      permitting the assessee to raise an additional ground in accordance with
      law and reason. The same observations would apply to appeals before
      the Tribunal also".
',                                         9         ITA No. 1074/PN/2007 &', 
',                                                  ITA No. 5182/Mum/2007



', 15.   In the absence of any contrary material placed on record by the

Revenue, keeping in view that all the material facts are available on

record and the legal ground taken by the assessee goes to the root of the

matter, we respectfully following the ratio of the above decisions, admit

the additional ground raised by the assessee.
', 

', u"16.   On merit, in order to appreciate the submissions of the parties and

the relevant provisions of the Act, we find that recently the similar issue

came up before the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in Anil Kumar Bhatia

(supra) wherein Their Lordships after considering the relevant provisions

section of 153", A of the Act',  and CBDT Circular (supra) have observed and

held as under:-
', 

',       "16. We now proceed to discuss the correctness of the conclusion of the
      Tribunal that the Assessing Officer had wrongly invoked ', Section 153A',  of
      the Act. This Section was introduced into the Act by the ', Finance Act', ,
      2003 w.e.f. 1.6.2003 along with ', Sections 153B',  and ', 153C', . ', Section 153A', u"

', 
', 17. The three sections introduced w.e.f. 1.6.2003 replaced the "Post
Search Block Assessment Scheme" in respect of any search under
', Section 132',  or requisition under ', Section 132A',  made after 31.5.2003. In
Circular No.7 of 2003 dated 5.9.2003 reported in (2003) 263 ITR (St)62,
the new Scheme was explained by the CBDT in the following manner:
', 
',       "65. The special procedure for assessment of search cases under
      Chapter XIV-B be abolished :', 

',        65.1 The existing provisions of the Chapter XIV-B provide for a
      single assessment of undisclosed income of a block period, which
      means the period comprising previous years relevant to six
      assessment years preceding the previous year in which the search

was conducted and also includes the period up to the date of the
commencement of such search, and lay down the manner in which
such income is to be computed.
',  65.2 ', The Finance Act', , 2003, has provided that the provisions of
this Chapter shall not apply where a search is initiated under
', section 132', , or books of account, other documents or any assets are
requisitioned under ', section 132A',  after May 31, 2003, by inserting a
new ', section 158BI',  in the ', Income-tax Act', .
', 
', 65.3 Further three new ', sections 153A', , ', 153B',  and ', 153C',  have been
inserted in the ', Income-tax Act',  to provide for assessment in case of
search or making requisition.
', 
', 65.4 The new ', section 153A',  provides the procedure for completion of
assessment where a search is initiated under ', section 132',  or books
of account, or other documents or any assets are requisitioned
under ', section 132A',  after May 31, 2003. In such cases, the
Assessing Officer shall issue notice to such person requiring him to
furnish, within such period as may be specified in the notice, return
of income in respect of six assessment years immediately preceding
the assessment year relevant to the previous year in which the
search was conducted under ', section 132',  or requisition was made
under ', section 132A', .
', 
',  65.5 The Assessing Officer shall assess or reassess the total
income of each of these six assessment years. Assessment or
reassessment, if any, relating to any assessment year falling within
the period of six assessment years pending on the date of initiation
of the search under ', section 132',  or requisition under ', section 132A', ,
as the case may be, shall abate. It is clarified that the appeal,
revision or rectification proceedings pending on the date of initiation
of search under ', section 132',  or requisition shall not abate. Save as
otherwise provided in the proposed ', section 153A', , ', section 153B',  and
', section 153C', , all other provisions of this Act shall apply to the
assessment or reassessment made under ', section 153A', . It is also
clarified that assessment or reassessment made under ', section
153A',  shall be subject to interest, penalty and prosecution, if
applicable. In the assessment or reassessment made in respect of
an assessment year under this section, the tax shall be chargeable
at the rate or rates as applicable to such assessment year.
', 
', 65.6 The new ', section 153B',  provides for the time limit for completion
of search assessments. It provides that the Assessing Officer shall
make an order of assessment or reassessment in respect of each
assessment year, falling within six assessment years under ', section
153A',  within a period of two years from the end of the financial year
in which the last of the authorisations for search under ', section 132', 
or for requisition under ', section 132A',  was executed.

65.7 This section also provides that assessment in respect of the
assessment year relevant to the previous year in which the search
is conducted under ', section 132',  or requisition is made under ', section
132A',  shall be completed within a period of two years from the end
of the financial year in which the last of the authorisations for
search under ', section 132',  or for requisition under ', section 132A', , as
the case may be, was executed."
', 
', 65.8 It also provides that in computing the period of limitation for
completion of such assessment or reassessment, the period during
which the assessment proceeding is stayed by an order or
injunction of any court ; or the period commencing from the day on
which the Assessing Officer directs the assessee to get his accounts
audited under sub-section (2A) of ', section 142',  and ending on the
day on which the assessee is required to furnish a report of such
audit under that sub-section, or the time taken in reopening the
whole or any part of the proceeding or giving an opportunity to the
assessee of being re-heard under the proviso to ', section 129', , or in a
case where an application made before the Settlement Commission
under ', section 245C',  is rejected by it or is not allowed to be
proceeded with by it, the period commencing on the date on which
such application is made and ending with the date on which the
order under sub-section (1) of ', section 245D',  is received by the
Commissioner under sub-section (2) of that section, shall be
excluded. If, after the exclusion of the aforesaid period, the period of
limitation available to the Assessing Officer for making an order of
assessment or reassessment, as the case may be, is less than sixty
days, such remaining period shall be extended to sixty days and
the period of limitation shall be deemed to be extended accordingly.
', 
', 65.9 The new ', section 153C',  provides that where an Assessing
Officer is satisfied that any money, bullion, jewellery or other
valuable article or thing or books of account or documents seized or
requisitioned belong or belongs to a person other than the person
referred to in ', section 153A', , then the books of account, or documents
or assets seized or requisitioned shall be handed over to the
Assessing Officer having jurisdiction over such other person and
that Assessing Officer shall proceed against such other person and
issue such other person notice and assess or reassess income of
such other person in accordance with the provisions of ', section
153A', .
', 
', 65.10 An appeal against the order of assessment or reassessment
under ', section 153A',  shall lie with the Commissioner of Income-tax
(Appeals).
', 
',  65.11 Consequential amendments have also been made in ', sections
132', , ', 132B', , ', 140A', , ', 234A', , ', 234B', , ', 246A',  and ', 276CC',  to give reference
to ', section 153A',  in these sections.

       65.12 These amendments will take effect from June 1, 2003.
', 
', 18. A perusal of ', Section 153A',  shows that it starts with a non obstante
clause relating to normal assessment procedure which is covered by
', Sections 139', , ', 147', , ', 148', , ', 149', , ', 151',  and ', 153',  in respect of searches made
after 31.5.2003. These Sections, the applicability of which has been
excluded, relate to returns, assessment and reassessment provisions.
Prior to, the introduction of these three Sections, there was Chapter XIV-
B of the Act which took care of the assessment to be made in cases of
search and seizure. Such an assessment was popularly known as \u201eblock
assessment because the Chapter provided for a single assessment to be
made in respect of a period of a block of ten assessment years prior to
the assessment year in which the search was made. In addition to these
ten assessment years, the broken period up to the date on which the
search was conducted was also included in what was known as \u201eblock
period . Though a single assessment order was to be passed, the
undisclosed income was to be assessed in the different assessment years
to which it related. But all this had to be made in a single assessment
order. The block assessment so made was independent of and in addition
to the normal assessment proceedings as clarified by the Explanation
below ', Section 158BA(2)', . After the introduction of the group of Sections
namely, 153A to 153C, the single block assessment concept was given a
go-by. Under the new ', Section 153A', , in a case where a search is initiated
under ', Section 132',  or requisition of books of account, documents or
assets is made under ', Section 132A',  after 31.5.2003, the Assessing Officer
is obliged to issue notices calling upon the searched person to furnish
returns for the six assessment years immediately preceding the
assessment year relevant to the previous year in which the search was
conducted or requisition was made. The other difference is that there is
no broken period from the first day of April of the financial year in which
the search took place or the requisition was made and ending with the
date of search/requisition. Under ', Section 153A',  and the new scheme
provided for, the AO is required to exercise the normal assessment
powers in respect of the previous year in which the search took place.
', 
', 19. Under the provisions of ', Section 153A', , as we have already noticed,
the Assessing Officer is bound to issue notice to the assessee to furnish
returns for each assessment year falling within the six assessment years
immediately preceding the assessment year relevant to the previous year
in which the search or requisition was made. Another significant feature
of this Section is that the Assessing Officer is empowered to assess or
reassess the "total income" of the aforesaid years. This is a significant
departure from the earlier block assessment scheme in which the block
assessment roped in only the undisclosed income and the regular
assessment proceedings were preserved, resulting in multiple
assessments. Under ', Section 153A', , however, the Assessing Officer has
been given the power to assess or reassess the \u201etotal income of the six
assessment years in question in separate assessment orders. This means
that there can be only one assessment order in respect of each of the six
',                                  14        ITA No. 1074/PN/2007 &', 
                                          ITA No. 5182/Mum/2007



assessment years, in which both the disclosed and the undisclosed
income would be brought to tax.
', 
', 20. A question may arise as to how this is sought to be achieved where
an assessment order had already been passed in respect of all or any of
those six assessment years, either under ', Section 143(1)(a)',  or ', Section
143(3)',  of the Act. If such an order is already in existence, having
obviously been passed prior to the initiation of the search/requisition,
the Assessing Officer is empowered to reopen those proceedings and
reassess the total income, taking note of the undisclosed income, if any,
unearthed during the search. For this purpose, the fetters imposed upon
the Assessing Officer by the strict procedure to assume jurisdiction to
reopen the assessment under ', Sections 147',  and ', 148', , have been removed
by the non obstante clause with which sub section (1) of ', Section 153A', 
opens. The time-limit within which the notice under ', Section 148',  can be
issued, as provided in ', Section 149',  has also been made inapplicable by
the non obstante clause. ', Section 151',  which requires sanction to be
obtained by the Assessing Officer by issue of notice to reopen the
assessment under ', Section 148',  has also been excluded in a case covered
by ', Section 153A', . The time-limit prescribed for completion of an
assessment or reassessment by ', Section 153',  has also been done away
with in a case covered by ', Section 153A', . With all the stops having been
pulled out, the Assessing Officer under ', Section 153A',  has been entrusted
with the duty of bringing to tax the total income of an assessee whose
case is covered by ', Section 153A', , by even making reassessments without
any fetters, if need be.
', 
', 21. Now there can be cases where at the time when the search is
initiated or requisition is made, the assessment or reassessment
proceedings relating to any assessment year falling within the period of
the six assessment years mentioned above, may be pending. In such a
case, the second proviso to sub section (1) of ', Section 153A',  says that
such proceedings "shall abate". The reason is not far to seek. Under
', Section 153A', , there is no room for multiple assessment orders in respect
of any of the six assessment years under consideration. That is because
the Assessing Officer has to determine not merely the undisclosed
income of the assessee, but also the \u201etotal income of the assessee in
whose case a search or requisition has been initiated. Obviously there
cannot be several orders for the same assessment year determining the
total income of the assessee. In order to ensure this state of affairs
namely, that in respect of the six assessment years preceding the
assessment year relevant to the year in which the search took place there
is only one determination of the total income, it has been provided in the
second proviso of sub Section (1) of ', Section 153A',  that any proceedings
for assessment or reassessment of the assessee which are pending on the
date of initiation of the search or making requisition "shall abate". Once
those proceedings abate, the decks are cleared, for the Assessing Officer
to pass assessment orders for each of those six years determining the
total income of the assessee which would include both the income
',                                       15        ITA No. 1074/PN/2007 &', 
                                               ITA No. 5182/Mum/2007



      declared in the returns, if any, furnished by the assessee as well as the
      undisclosed income, if any, unearthed during the search or requisition.
      The position thus emerging is that where assessment or reassessment
      proceedings are pending completion when the search is initiated or
      requisition is made, they will abate making way for the Assessing Officer
      to determine the total income of the assessee in which the undisclosed
      income would also be included, but in cases where the assessment or
      reassessment proceedings have already been completed and assessment
      orders have been passed determining the assessee s total income and
      such orders are subsisting at the time when the search or the requisition
      is made, there is no question of any abatement since no proceedings are
      pending. In this latter situation, the Assessing Officer will reopen the
      assessments or reassessments already made (without having the need to
      follow the strict provisions or complying with the strict conditions of
      ', Sections 147', , ', 148',  and ', 151', ) and determine the total income of the
      assessee. Such determination in the orders passed under ', Section 153A', 
      would be similar to the orders passed in any reassessment, where the
      total income determined in the original assessment order and the income
      that escaped assessment are clubbed together and assessed as the total
      income. In such a case, to reiterate, there is no question of any
      abatement of the earlier proceedings for the simple reason that no
      proceedings for assessment or reassessment were pending since they had
      already culminated in assessment or reassessment orders when the
      search was initiated or the requisition was made".
', 

', 17.   Similar issue came up in Abhay Kumar Shroff (supra) wherein

Ther Lordships after considering the relevant provisions of the Act

(supra) and CBDT Circular (supra) have observed and held vide para 12

to 16 as under:-
', 

',       "12. From a bare reading of the provisions of ', sections 153A', , ', 153B',  and
      ', 153C',  of the Act and the Departmental Circular dated September 5, 2003
      (see [2003] 263 ITR (St.) 62), it is manifestly clear that after May 31,
      2003, the earlier provision of block assessment in the case of search
      initiated against the assessee, shall not apply. Instead, the provision
      that there shall be single assessment on undisclosed income comprising
      previous years relating to six assessment years preceding in which the
      search was conducted, shall apply. It further provides that the Assessing
      Officer shall issue notice to such person requiring him to furnish return
      of income in respect of six assessment years immediately preceding the
      assessment year relating to the previous year in which the search was
      conducted under ', section 132',  or requisition was made under ', section
      132A',  of the Act.

', 13.   The second proviso to ', section 153A',  makes it clear that
assessment or reassessment relating to any assessment year falling



within the period of six assessment years pending on the date of
initiation of the search under ', section 132',  or requisition under ', section
132A',  shall abate. In other words, if on the date of initiation of search or
requisition under ', section 132',  or ', section 132A',  any assessment or
reassessment proceeding is initiated relating to any assessment year
falling within the period of six assessment years, it shall stand abated
and the assessing authority cannot and shall not proceed with such
pending assessment after initiation of search or requisition as
contemplated hereinabove.
', 
', 14.   The word "abate" or "abatement" has not been defined in the Act
or in the circular. According to Chambers Dictionary the word "abate"
means demolition or to put an end to.
', 
', The Law Lexicon defines the word "abate", which means to throw down,
destroy or quash or to nullify. According to Black's Law Dictionary the
word "abatement" means the act of eliminating or nullifying or
suspension or defeat of a pending action.
', 

', According to Advanced Law Lexicon by P. Ramanathan Aiyar the word
"abate" means diminish or take away or to put end to or to come to a
naught. The term is used in the U. S. A. to describe the cancellation in
whole or in part of a Government levy (business term and international
accounting).
', 
', 15.     Coming back to the instant case, as noticed above, the search and
seizure was initiated by the respondents on August 24, 2006, which was
carried out by various authorised officials. Thereafter, as admitted by the
respondents in their counter affidavit, no notice as required under
', section 153A',  was issued to the petitioner for the six assessment years,
i.e., from 2001-02 to 2006-07. It has not been disputed by the
respondents that the date on which the search was initiated the
assessment proceeding was pending on the basis of the return furnished
by the petitioner. Consequently, therefore, the pending assessment
proceeding stood abated by virtue of the second proviso to ', section 153A', 
of the said Act. Instead of complying with the requirements of ', section
153A',  of the Act, the respondents            proceeded with the pending
assessment proceeding for the assessment year 2004-05 and passed an
assessment order during the pendency of the instant writ application.
The said impugned order has also been challenged by the petitioner by
filing amendment petition.
', 
', 16.    In the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the case, I am of the
definite opinion that the entire action of the respondents in proceeding
',                                         17        ITA No. 1074/PN/2007 &', 
                                                 ITA No. 5182/Mum/2007



      with the assessment after search in contravention of the provisions of
      ', section 153A',  is vitiated in law. Consequently, the impugned assessment
      order dated December 28, 2006, purportedly passed under ', section
      143(3)',  of the Act in a pending assessment proceeding which stood
      abated is a nullity. As discussed above, continuation of the impugned
      assessment proceeding after the initiation of search without giving any
      notice under ', section 153A',  of the Act and passing the impugned final
      order of assessment is illegal, arbitrary and wholly without jurisdiction".
', 

', u"18.   Recently Their Lordships of Hon'ble Allahabad High Court in case

of Smt. Shaila Agarwal (supra) while considering the provisions of ", section

153A', u" of the Act and the meaning of words 'abate' and 'pending' referred

in the above provision have observed and held as under (headnote) :-
", 

',       "', Section 153A',  of the Income Tax Act, 1961, provides that where notice
      under this section is issued as a result of any search under ', section 132', ,
      assessment or reassessment, if any, relating to any assessment year
      falling within the period of six assessment years referred to under ', section
      153', , pending on the date of initiation of search under ', section 132',  or
      requisition under ', section 132A',  shall abate. The words "pending on the
      date of initiation of search under ', section 132',  or making of requisition
      under ', section 132A', , as the case may be," have to be assigned their
      simple and plain meaning. Where the assessment or reassessment is
      finalised, there are no pending proceedings to abate and be restored to
      the file of the Assessing Officer. The word "abatement" is referable to
      something which is pending, alive, or is subject to deduction. Abatement
      refers to suspension or termination of proceedings either of the main
      action, or proceedings ancillary or collateral to it. Proceedings which have
      already terminated are not liable for abatement unless the statute
      expressly provides for it. The word "pending" occurring in the second
      proviso to ', section 153A',  of the Act is qualified by the words "on the date
      of initiation of the search", and makes it abundantly clear that only such
      assessment or reassessment proceedings are liable to abate. The
      pendency of an appeal in the Tribunal against the order of assessment
      against which an appeal has been decided by the Commissioner
      (Appeals) is not a continuation of the proceedings of assessment. An
      appeal under the ', Income-tax Act',  lies to the Appellate Tribunal on a
      question of law. Even f it is pending on the date of search the
      reassessment proceedings will not abate. The abatement of any
      proceedings has serious effect inasmuch as it takes away all the
',                                        18         ITA No. 1074/PN/2007 &',

      consequences that arise thereafter. The material found in the search may
      be a ground for notice and assessment under ', section 153A',  of the Act but
      that would not efface or terminate all the consequences, which arise out
      of the regular assessment or reassessment resulting in a demand or
      proceedings for penalty.
', 
',       The assessee filed a return for the assessment year 2002-03. She was
      required to produce evidence regarding gifts. He was unable to do so and
      hence an addition was made to her income. The Commissioner (Appeals)
      confirmed the addition. After the decision of the Commissioner (Appeals)
      search proceedings were initiated against the assessee. A notice under
      ', section 153A',  was issued to the assessee as a result of search and
      seizure, calling upon the assessee to file returns for six assessment years
      including the assessment year 2002-03. The Tribunal held that once a
      notice under ', section 153A',  had been issued after search and seizure
      operations, according to the provisions of ', section 153A', , all the
      assessments of the six preceding assessment years prior to the search
      abated. On appeal to the High Court:
', 
',       Held, that the assessment proceedings did not abate".

which, one of us was a party) and the Special Bench had an occasion to

deal with the scope of interpretation of ', section 153A', u" of the Act in the

case of in All Cargo Global Logistics Ltd. (supra). The Special Bench of

the Tribunal after considering the various decisions and CBDT circulars

including the Circular No. 7 of 2003 dtd. 5-9-2003 and the decision of

the Hon'ble Jharkhand High Court in Abhay Kumar Shroff (supra)

[mentioned in the list of cases/circulars] has held as under:-
", 

',       "52. The provision comes into operation if a search or requisition is
      initiated after 31.5.2003. On satisfaction of this condition, the AO is
      under obligation to issue notice to the person requiring him to furnish
      the return of income of six years immediately preceding the year of
      search. The word used is "shall" and, thus, there is no option but to
      issue such a notice. Thereafter he has to assess or reassess total income
      of these six years. In this respect also, the word used is "shall" and,
',                                  19        ITA No. 1074/PN/2007 &', 
                                          ITA No. 5182/Mum/2007



therefore, the AO has no option but to asses or reassess the total income
of these six years. The pending proceedings shall abate. This means that
out of six years, if any assessment or reassessment is pending on the
date of initiation of the search, it shall abate. In other words pending
proceedings will not be proceeded with thereafter. The assessment has
now to be made u/s 153A (1)(b) and the first proviso. It also means that
only one assessment will be made under the aforesaid provisions as the
two proceedings i.e. assessment or reassessment proceedings and
proceedings under this provision merged into one. If assessment made
under sub-section (1) is annulled in appeal or other legal proceedings,
then the abated assessment or reassessment shall revive. This means
that the assessment or reassessment, which had abated, shall be made,
for which extension of time has been provided under ', section 153B', .
', 
', 53.    The question now is - what is the scope of assessment or
reassessment of total income u/s 153A (1) (b) and the first proviso ? We
are of the view that for answering this question, guidance will have to be
sought from ', section 132(1)', . If any books of account or other documents
relevant to the assessment had not been produced in the course of
original assessment and found in the course of search in our humble
opinion such books of account or other documents have to be taken into
account while making assessment or reassessment of total income under
the aforesaid provision. Similar position will obtain in a case where
undisclosed income or undisclosed property has been found as a
consequence of search. In other words, harmonious interpretation will
produce the following results :-
', 
', a) In so far as pending assessments are concerned, the jurisdiction to
make original assessment and assessment u/s 153A merge into one and
only one assessment for each assessment year shall be made separately
on the basis of the findings of the search and any other material existing
or brought on the record of the A.O.
', 
', b)     in respect of non-abated assessments, the assessment will be
made on the basis of books of account or other documents not produced
in the course of original assessment but found in the course of search,
and undisclosed income or undisclosed property discovered in the course
of search."
', 
',              ......                  ........                ......
', 58. Thus, question No.1 before us is answered a) as under :
', (a)    In assessments that are abated, the A.O. retains the original
jurisdiction as well as jurisdiction conferred on him under',  s. 153A',  for
which assessments shall be made for each of the six assessment years
separately ;
', 
', b)    In other cases, in addition to the income that has already been
assesed, the asesment u/s 153A wil be made on the basis of
incriminating material, which in the context of relevant provisions means
',                                        20       ITA No. 1074/PN/2007 &', 
                                               ITA No. 5182/Mum/2007



',       - (i) books of account, other documents, found in the course of search
      but not produced in the course of original asessment, and (i) undisclosed
      income or property discovered in the course of search.
', 
',       59. Having come to this conclusion we need not go into various orders of
      the `Tribunal cited by the rival parties. The decisions inconsistent with
      the aforesaid view/conclusion stand disapproved and the decisions
      consistent with this view/conclusion are approved".
', 
', u"20.   Applying the ratio of the above decisions to the facts of the present

case, we find that the search and seizure was initiated by the

Department in assessee's case on 30-11-2006 on which date the

assessment for A.Y. 2004-05 was pending which was completed on 27-
", 
', 12-2006 u/s 143(3) of the Act. We further find that there is no dispute

that the assessee is covered under the search action u/s 132(1) of the

Act dtd.    30-11-2006. Consequently notice u/s 153', A of the Act',  was

issued to the assessee on 12-10-2007 and in response, the assessee filed

its return of income on 15-11-2007 declaring total income of Rs.
', 
', 1,64,50,999/-    as   against   the   income    originally   shown      at   Rs.
', 
', 1,62,08,636/- in the return filed u/s 139(1) of the Act. It is also not in

dispute that as on the date of search, the assessment proceeding for the

A.Y. 2004-05 was pending and the regular assessment was completed on

27-12-2006 vide order passed u/s 143(3) of the Act. The position thus

emerging is that where assessment proceedings are pending completion

when the search is initiated, the pending assessment proceeding stood

abated by virtue of the second proviso to ', section 153A',  of the Act.
', 
', Instead of complying with the requirements of ', section 153A',  of the Act,

the A.O. proceeded with the pending assessment proceeding for the A.Y.
',                                        21        ITA No. 1074/PN/2007 &', 
',                                                 ITA No. 5182/Mum/2007



2004-05 and passed the impugned assessment order during the

pendency of the assessment u/s 153', A of the Act',  which is a nullity and

as such the assessment order dtd. 27-12-2006 passed u/s 143(3) of the

Act is illegal, arbitrary, wholly without jurisdiction and, hence, the same

is quashed.
', 

', 21.   As regards the plea of the ld. D.R. that in the assessment order

passed      u/s   153', A    of   the    Act', ,   the    A.O.    has    made     the

additions/disallowances on the basis of the impugned assessment order

passed u/s 143(3) of the Act, therefore, on equitable ground, the said

additions may remain to be considered as made in the assessment order

passed u/s 153', A of the Act', , we find that it is a settled law that where

there is no ambiguity and the intention of the legislature is clearly

conveyed, there is no scope for the court to undertake any exercise to

read something into the provisions which the legislature in its wisdom

concisely omitted.    Such an exercise is undertaken by the court may

amount to amending or altering statutory provisions. The courts have to

decide what the law is and not what it should be. For this proposition,

reliance is also placed on the following decisions:-
', 

',       (1)     ', In Union of India vs. Deoki Nandan Aggarwal', u" (1992) Supp. 1 SCC
      323, a three judge Bench of Hon'ble Supreme Court held that it is not
      the duty of the Court either to enlarge the scope of legislation or the
      intention of the Legislature, when the language of the provision is plain.", 
',       The Court cannot rewrite the legislation for the reason that it had no
',                                   22        ITA No. 1074/PN/2007 &', 
                                           ITA No. 5182/Mum/2007



power to legislate. The power to legislate has not been conferred on the
Courts. The Court cannot add words to a statute or read words into it
which are not there.
', 
', (2)    ', In State of Kerala vs. Mathai Verghese',  (1986) 4 SCC 746, the
Hon'ble Supreme Court has reiterated the well-settled position that the
Court can merely interpret the section; it cannot rewrite, recast or
redesign the section.      In interpreting the provision the exercise
undertaken by the Court is to make explicit the intention of the
Legislature which enacted the legislation.     It is not for the Court to
reframe the legislation for the very good reason that the powers to
"legislate" have not been conferred on the Court.
', 
', (3)    ', In Gwalior Rayons Silk Mfg. (Wvg.) Co. Ltd. vs. Custodian of
Vested Forests', u" (1990) (Supp) SCC 785 the Hon'ble Supreme Court
observed that in seeking legislative intention Judges not only listen to the
voice of the Legislature but also listen attentively to what the Legislature
does not say.
", 
', u"4.     The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of ", Federation of Andhra
Pradesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry v. State of Andhra
Pradesh',  reported in [2001] 247 ITR 36 (SC) reiterated the basic principle
that (page 39):-
', 
',         "it is trite law that a taxing statute has to be strictly construed
       and nothing can be read into it..... In a taxing Act one has to look
       merely at what is clearly said.        There is no room for any
       intendment. There is no equity about a tax. There is no
       presumption as to a tax. Nothing is to be read in, nothing is to be
       implied. One can look fairly at the language used." The Hon'ble
       Supreme Court further went on to hold that (page 39) "the courts
       in interpreting a taxing statute will not be justified in adding
       words thereto so as to make out some presumed object of the
       Legislature...... If the legislature has failed to clarify its meaning
       by the use of the appropriate language, the benefit thereof must go
       to the taxpayer. It is settled law that in case of doubt, that
       interpretation of a taxing statute which is beneficial to the
       taxpayer must be adopted."
',                                        23        ITA No. 1074/PN/2007 &', 
',                                                 ITA No. 5182/Mum/2007



      (5)   ', In CIT vs. Tara Agencies',  (2007) 292 ITR 444 (SC) it has been held
      by Their Lordships at page 464 as under:-
', 
',             "Therefore, the legal position seems to be clear and consistent that
            it is the bounden duty and obligation of the Court to interpret the
            statute as it is. It is contrary to all rules of construction to read
            words into a statute which the legislature in its wisdom has
            deliberately not incorporated."
', 
', 22.   Respectfully following the above settled position of law, the plea

taken by the ld. D.R. is devoid of any merit and, hence, rejected.
', 

', 23.   Since we have quashed the impugned assessment order on the

legal ground raised by the assessee, therefore, we do not consider it

necessary to discuss the grounds raised by the assessee and Revenue on

merits of the additions sustained/relief allowed. Accordingly the other

grounds taken by the assessee and Revenue are rejected.
', 

', u"24.   In the result, the assessee's appeal stands partly allowed and

Revenue's appeal is dismissed.",

order for the sake of convenience.

', u"2.    Briefly stated facts of the case are that the assessee company is

engaged in the manufacturing of bakers' yeast and carries on trading

activity of bakery related ingredients.   The return of income was filed

declaring total income of Rs. 1,62,08,636/- along with tax audit report,

other audit reports, P&L account and balance sheet.         The A.O. after

processing the return u/s 143(1) of the ", Income Tax Act', , 1961 (the Act) on

the same income as disclosed, selected the case for scrutiny and

accordingly issued notices u/s 143(2) and 142(1) of the Act. The A.O.
', 
', also issued a detail questionnaire calling for specific information on

various issues concerning the assessment. In response, the assessee

attended from time to time. However, the assessee has not furnished full

information as called for. Since the assessment was getting barred by

limitation, the A.O., in the absence of any other alternative, completed

the assessment on the basis of information available on record. The A.O.

', after making the disallowance of depreciation of Rs. 95,094/-, out of

distribution expenses Rs. 93,38,903/-, out of professional charges Rs.

Revenue both are in appeal before us.

depreciation, deduction u/s 80IA & 80IB, distribution expenses and

foreign travelling expenses whereas the Revenue has challenged the relief

allowed by the ld. CIT(A) out of distribution expenses, professional

charges, foreign travel expenses and deduction u/s 80IA and 80IB of the

Act.

', 5.     The assessee vide petition dtd. 12-9-2012 made a request for

admission of additional ground of appeal which reads as under:-
', 

',        "The ld. Commissioner of Income tax (Appeals) erred in confirming the
       assessment order under ', section 143(3)',  of the Income Tax Act passed on
       27-12-2006 without considering the fact that a search and seizure action
       on the appellant under ', section 132(1)',  of the Act was carried out on 30-
       11-2006, the pending assessment had already abated on the date of the
       search under the second proviso to ', Section 153A',  of the Act which
       therefore had to be quashed."

', 6.     In the said petition it was submitted by the assessee that a search

and seizure action u/s 132(1) of the Act took place on the assessee on

30-11-2006 and on the date of the search the assessment for the A.Y.

search, the A.O. issued notices under ', Section 153A',  for six assessment

years immediately preceding the assessment year relevant to the

previous year in which the search took place and accordingly the A.O.
', 
', passed the order u/s. 153A read with ', Section 143(3)',  for all these six

assessment years on 27.11.2008 including the year of the search and

seizure i.e. assessment year 2007-08. It was further submitted that the

assessee filed an appeal against the order u/s.153A read with ', Section

143(3)',  before the C.I.T. (Appeals) which is pending. It was further

submitted that since the assessment order for the A.Y. 2004-05 has been

passed after the search operation on 30.11.2006 in pursuance to the

pending assessment on that date, the same will not have any legal

validity and it is to be quashed. The reliance was also placed in ', Abhay

Kumar Shroff vs CIT and Ors', u" reported in (2007) 210 CTR (Jharkhand)

602 : (2007) 290 ITR 114 (Jharkhand). In the light of the above, it was

submitted that though the aforesaid additional ground was not raised

before the Id. C.I.T.(Appeals) and is now being raised before the Tribunal

for the first time, it is a pure question of law arising from the facts which

are on record in the assessment proceedings, therefore, the additional

ground may be admitted. For this purpose, the reliance was also placed

on the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of ", National

Thermal Power Co. Ltd. vs CIT',  (1998) 229 ITR 383 (SC) wherein it has

been held that "Undoubtedly, the Tribunal has the discretion to allow or

not to allow a new ground to be raised. But where the Tribunal is only

required to consider the question of law arising from facts which are on

record in the assessment proceedings, there is no reason why such a

question should not be allowed to be raised when it is necessary to

consider that question in order to correctly assess the tax liability of an

assessee." The reliance was also placed in the case of ', ITO vs M.M', .
', 
', Textiles reported in (2010) 122 I.T.D 435 (Mum) wherein it was held that

when additional legal grounds are raised, before the Tribunal after

obtaining leave from the Tribunal, such legal grounds should be accepted

by the Tribunal provided facts are on record in the assessment

proceedings. It was, therefore prayed that such additional ground be

admitted.
', 

', 7.    At the time of hearing the ld. Counsel for the assessee while

reiterating the same submissions as submitted in the petition dtd.
', 
', 12-9-2012 further submits that in view of the decision cited in the said

petition, the additional ground raised by the assessee be admitted. He

also placed on record a copy of the assessment order for the same A.Y.

', i.e. A.Y. 2004-05 passed after the search u/s 153A r.w.s. 143(3) of the

Act dtd. 27-11-2008.
', 

', 8.    On merit of the additional ground of appeal, the ld. Counsel for the

assessee submits that there is no dispute that as on the date of search

i.e. on 30-11-2006 the assessment for the A.Y. 2004-05 was pending. In

other words as on the date of search, the pending assessment had

therefore, the A.O. has grossly erred in passing the impugned

assessment u/s 143(3) of the Act dtd. 27-12-2006 which is liable to be

quashed and for this proposition, the reliance was also placed on the

following CBDT Circular and decisions:-

In the light of the above, he submits that the impugned regular

assessment passed by the A.O. is a nullity and, hence, the same may be

quashed.

', 9.   On the other hand, the ld. D.R. while agreeing that the facts are

available on record, did not object to the admission of legal ground of

appeal.      He further submits that in the subsequent assessment order

passed by the A.O. u/s 153A r.w.s. 143(3) of the Act, dtd. 27-11-2008,

the A.O. has made similar disallowance u/s 80IA, 80IB, distribution

disallowance made by the A.O. may remain to be considered as made in

the assessment order u/s 153A r.w.s. 143(3) of the Act.
', 

', 10.   We have carefully considered the submission of the rival parties

and perused the material available on record. We find that the facts are

not in dispute inasmuch as it is also not in dispute that in this case a

search and seizure action u/s 132(1) of the Act was taken place on the

assessee on 30-11-2006 and on the date of search the assessment for

the year under consideration i.e. A.Y. 2004-05 was pending and the

same assessment order was passed by the A.O. u/s 143(3) of the Act on

27-12-2006 i.e. after the date of search.
', 

', 11.   The assessee in the additional ground has challenged the validity

of the impugned assessment order on the ground that as on the date of

search i.e. on 30-11-2006, the pending assessment had already abated

under the second proviso to ', section 153A',  of the Act and in support he

placed on record the copy of the assessment order dtd. 27-11-2008

passed u/s 153A r.w.s. 143(3) of the Act and also relied on CBDT

Circular and various decisions (supra).

observed that the question of law which arose from the fact as found by

the income-tax authority any legal issue can be raised at any stage. The

hon'ble Supreme Court observed that (page 387) :
", 

',       "where the Tribunal is only required to consider a question of law arising
      from the facts which are on record in the assessment proceedings we fail
      to see why such a question should not be allowed to be raised when it is
      necessary to consider that question in order to correctly assess the tax
      liability of an assessee".
', 

', 13.   Similarly in the case of ', CIT vs. Jai Parabolic Springs Ltd', . [2008]

206 ITR 42 (Delhi) it was observed that (headnote) :
', 

',       "..........that there was no prohibition on the powers of the Tribunal to
      entertain an additional ground which according to the Tribunal arose in
      the matter and for the just decision of the case. There was no infirmity in
      the order of the Tribunal."
', 

', 14.   It is also pertinent to mention that in the case of ', Jute Corporation

of India Ltd. v. CIT',  [1991] 187 ITR 688 (SC) it was observed that :
', 

',       "An appellate authority has all the powers which the original authority
      may have in deciding the question before it subject to the restrictions or
      limitations, if any, prescribed by the statutory provisions. In the absence
      of any statutory provision, the appellate authority is vested with all the
      plenary powers which the subordinate authority may have in the matter.
      There is no good reason to justify curtailment of the power of the
      Appellate Assistant Commissioner in entertaining an additional ground
      raised by the assessee in seeking modification of the order of assessment
      passed by the Income-tax Officer. There may be several factors justifying
      the raising of such a new plea in an appeal, and each case has to be
      considered on its own facts. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner must
      be satisfied that the ground raised was bonafide and that the same could
      not have been raised earlier for good reasons. Appellate Assistant
      Commissioner should exercise his discretion in permitting or not
      permitting the assessee to raise an additional ground in accordance with
      law and reason. The same observations would apply to appeals before
      the Tribunal also".

matter, we respectfully following the ratio of the above decisions, admit

the additional ground raised by the assessee.

', u"16.   On merit, in order to appreciate the submissions of the parties and

the relevant provisions of the Act, we find that recently the similar issue

came up before the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in Anil Kumar Bhatia

held as under:-
', 

',       "16. We now proceed to discuss the correctness of the conclusion of the

Circular No.7 of 2003 dated 5.9.2003 reported in (2003) 263 ITR (St)62,
the new Scheme was explained by the CBDT in the following manner:
', 
',       "65. The special procedure for assessment of search cases under
      Chapter XIV-B be abolished :', 

',        65.1 The existing provisions of the Chapter XIV-B provide for a
      single assessment of undisclosed income of a block period, which
      means the period comprising previous years relevant to six
      assessment years preceding the previous year in which the search

was conducted and also includes the period up to the date of the
commencement of such search, and lay down the manner in which
such income is to be computed.
',  65.2 ', The Finance Act', , 2003, has provided that the provisions of
this Chapter shall not apply where a search is initiated under
', section 132', , or books of account, other documents or any assets are
requisitioned under ', section 132A',  after May 31, 2003, by inserting a
new ', section 158BI',  in the ', Income-tax Act', .
', 
', 65.3 Further three new ', sections 153A', , ', 153B',  and ', 153C',  have been
inserted in the ', Income-tax Act',  to provide for assessment in case of
search or making requisition.
', 
', 65.4 The new ', section 153A',  provides the procedure for completion of
assessment where a search is initiated under ', section 132',  or books
of account, or other documents or any assets are requisitioned
under ', section 132A',  after May 31, 2003. In such cases, the
Assessing Officer shall issue notice to such person requiring him to
furnish, within such period as may be specified in the notice, return
of income in respect of six assessment years immediately preceding
the assessment year relevant to the previous year in which the
search was conducted under ', section 132',  or requisition was made
under ', section 132A', .
', 
',  65.5 The Assessing Officer shall assess or reassess the total
income of each of these six assessment years. Assessment or
reassessment, if any, relating to any assessment year falling within
the period of six assessment years pending on the date of initiation
of the search under ', section 132',  or requisition under ', section 132A', ,
as the case may be, shall abate. It is clarified that the appeal,
revision or rectification proceedings pending on the date of initiation
of search under ', section 132',  or requisition shall not abate. Save as
otherwise provided in the proposed ', section 153A', , ', section 153B',  and
', section 153C', , all other provisions of this Act shall apply to the
assessment or reassessment made under ', section 153A', . It is also
clarified that assessment or reassessment made under ', section
153A',  shall be subject to interest, penalty and prosecution, if
applicable. In the assessment or reassessment made in respect of
an assessment year under this section, the tax shall be chargeable
at the rate or rates as applicable to such assessment year.
', 
', 65.6 The new ', section 153B',  provides for the time limit for completion
of search assessments. It provides that the Assessing Officer shall
make an order of assessment or reassessment in respect of each
assessment year, falling within six assessment years under ', section
153A',  within a period of two years from the end of the financial year
in which the last of the authorisations for search under ', section 132', 
or for requisition under ', section 132A',  was executed.

65.7 This section also provides that assessment in respect of the
assessment year relevant to the previous year in which the search
is conducted under ', section 132',  or requisition is made under ', section
132A',  shall be completed within a period of two years from the end
of the financial year in which the last of the authorisations for
search under ', section 132',  or for requisition under ', section 132A', , as
the case may be, was executed."
', 
', 65.8 It also provides that in computing the period of limitation for
completion of such assessment or reassessment, the period during
which the assessment proceeding is stayed by an order or
injunction of any court ; or the period commencing from the day on
which the Assessing Officer directs the assessee to get his accounts
audited under sub-section (2A) of ', section 142',  and ending on the
day on which the assessee is required to furnish a report of such
audit under that sub-section, or the time taken in reopening the
whole or any part of the proceeding or giving an opportunity to the
assessee of being re-heard under the proviso to ', section 129', , or in a
case where an application made before the Settlement Commission
under ', section 245C',  is rejected by it or is not allowed to be
proceeded with by it, the period commencing on the date on which
such application is made and ending with the date on which the
order under sub-section (1) of ', section 245D',  is received by the
Commissioner under sub-section (2) of that section, shall be
excluded. If, after the exclusion of the aforesaid period, the period of
limitation available to the Assessing Officer for making an order of
assessment or reassessment, as the case may be, is less than sixty
days, such remaining period shall be extended to sixty days and
the period of limitation shall be deemed to be extended accordingly.
', 
', 65.9 The new ', section 153C',  provides that where an Assessing
Officer is satisfied that any money, bullion, jewellery or other
valuable article or thing or books of account or documents seized or
requisitioned belong or belongs to a person other than the person
referred to in ', section 153A', , then the books of account, or documents
or assets seized or requisitioned shall be handed over to the
Assessing Officer having jurisdiction over such other person and
that Assessing Officer shall proceed against such other person and
issue such other person notice and assess or reassess income of
such other person in accordance with the provisions of ', section
153A', .
', 
', 65.10 An appeal against the order of assessment or reassessment
under ', section 153A',  shall lie with the Commissioner of Income-tax
(Appeals).
', 
',  65.11 Consequential amendments have also been made in ', sections
132', , ', 132B', , ', 140A', , ', 234A', , ', 234B', , ', 246A',  and ', 276CC',  to give reference
to ', section 153A',  in these sections.

',                                            ITA No. 5182/Mum/2007



       65.12 These amendments will take effect from June 1, 2003.
', 
', 18. A perusal of ', Section 153A',  shows that it starts with a non obstante
clause relating to normal assessment procedure which is covered by
', Sections 139', , ', 147', , ', 148', , ', 149', , ', 151',  and ', 153',  in respect of searches made
after 31.5.2003. These Sections, the applicability of which has been
excluded, relate to returns, assessment and reassessment provisions.
Prior to, the introduction of these three Sections, there was Chapter XIV-
B of the Act which took care of the assessment to be made in cases of
search and seizure. Such an assessment was popularly known as \u201eblock
assessment because the Chapter provided for a single assessment to be
made in respect of a period of a block of ten assessment years prior to
the assessment year in which the search was made. In addition to these
ten assessment years, the broken period up to the date on which the
search was conducted was also included in what was known as \u201eblock
period . Though a single assessment order was to be passed, the
undisclosed income was to be assessed in the different assessment years
to which it related. But all this had to be made in a single assessment
order. The block assessment so made was independent of and in addition
to the normal assessment proceedings as clarified by the Explanation
below ', Section 158BA(2)', . After the introduction of the group of Sections
namely, 153A to 153C, the single block assessment concept was given a
go-by. Under the new ', Section 153A', , in a case where a search is initiated
under ', Section 132',  or requisition of books of account, documents or
assets is made under ', Section 132A',  after 31.5.2003, the Assessing Officer
is obliged to issue notices calling upon the searched person to furnish
returns for the six assessment years immediately preceding the
assessment year relevant to the previous year in which the search was
conducted or requisition was made. The other difference is that there is
no broken period from the first day of April of the financial year in which
the search took place or the requisition was made and ending with the
date of search/requisition. Under ', Section 153A',  and the new scheme
provided for, the AO is required to exercise the normal assessment
powers in respect of the previous year in which the search took place.
', 
', 19. Under the provisions of ', Section 153A', , as we have already noticed,
the Assessing Officer is bound to issue notice to the assessee to furnish
returns for each assessment year falling within the six assessment years
immediately preceding the assessment year relevant to the previous year
in which the search or requisition was made. Another significant feature
of this Section is that the Assessing Officer is empowered to assess or
reassess the "total income" of the aforesaid years. This is a significant
departure from the earlier block assessment scheme in which the block
assessment roped in only the undisclosed income and the regular
assessment proceedings were preserved, resulting in multiple
assessments. Under ', Section 153A', , however, the Assessing Officer has
been given the power to assess or reassess the \u201etotal income of the six
assessment years in question in separate assessment orders. This means
that there can be only one assessment order in respect of each of the six
',                                  14        ITA No. 1074/PN/2007 &', 
                                          ITA No. 5182/Mum/2007



assessment years, in which both the disclosed and the undisclosed
income would be brought to tax.
', 
', 20. A question may arise as to how this is sought to be achieved where
an assessment order had already been passed in respect of all or any of
those six assessment years, either under ', Section 143(1)(a)',  or ', Section
143(3)',  of the Act. If such an order is already in existence, having
obviously been passed prior to the initiation of the search/requisition,
the Assessing Officer is empowered to reopen those proceedings and
reassess the total income, taking note of the undisclosed income, if any,
unearthed during the search. For this purpose, the fetters imposed upon
the Assessing Officer by the strict procedure to assume jurisdiction to
reopen the assessment under ', Sections 147',  and ', 148', , have been removed
by the non obstante clause with which sub section (1) of ', Section 153A', 
opens. The time-limit within which the notice under ', Section 148',  can be
issued, as provided in ', Section 149',  has also been made inapplicable by
the non obstante clause. ', Section 151',  which requires sanction to be
obtained by the Assessing Officer by issue of notice to reopen the
assessment under ', Section 148',  has also been excluded in a case covered
by ', Section 153A', . The time-limit prescribed for completion of an
assessment or reassessment by ', Section 153',  has also been done away
with in a case covered by ', Section 153A', . With all the stops having been
pulled out, the Assessing Officer under ', Section 153A',  has been entrusted
with the duty of bringing to tax the total income of an assessee whose
case is covered by ', Section 153A', , by even making reassessments without
any fetters, if need be.
', 
', 21. Now there can be cases where at the time when the search is
initiated or requisition is made, the assessment or reassessment
proceedings relating to any assessment year falling within the period of
the six assessment years mentioned above, may be pending. In such a
case, the second proviso to sub section (1) of ', Section 153A',  says that
such proceedings "shall abate". The reason is not far to seek. Under
', Section 153A', , there is no room for multiple assessment orders in respect
of any of the six assessment years under consideration. That is because
the Assessing Officer has to determine not merely the undisclosed
income of the assessee, but also the \u201etotal income of the assessee in
whose case a search or requisition has been initiated. Obviously there
cannot be several orders for the same assessment year determining the
total income of the assessee. In order to ensure this state of affairs
namely, that in respect of the six assessment years preceding the
assessment year relevant to the year in which the search took place there
is only one determination of the total income, it has been provided in the
second proviso of sub Section (1) of ', Section 153A',  that any proceedings
for assessment or reassessment of the assessee which are pending on the
date of initiation of the search or making requisition "shall abate". Once
those proceedings abate, the decks are cleared, for the Assessing Officer
to pass assessment orders for each of those six years determining the
total income of the assessee which would include both the income
',                                       15        ITA No. 1074/PN/2007 &', 
                                               ITA No. 5182/Mum/2007



      declared in the returns, if any, furnished by the assessee as well as the
      undisclosed income, if any, unearthed during the search or requisition.
      The position thus emerging is that where assessment or reassessment
      proceedings are pending completion when the search is initiated or
      requisition is made, they will abate making way for the Assessing Officer
      to determine the total income of the assessee in which the undisclosed
      income would also be included, but in cases where the assessment or
      reassessment proceedings have already been completed and assessment
      orders have been passed determining the assessee s total income and
      such orders are subsisting at the time when the search or the requisition
      is made, there is no question of any abatement since no proceedings are
      pending. In this latter situation, the Assessing Officer will reopen the
      assessments or reassessments already made (without having the need to
      follow the strict provisions or complying with the strict conditions of
      ', Sections 147', , ', 148',  and ', 151', ) and determine the total income of the
      assessee. Such determination in the orders passed under ', Section 153A', 
      would be similar to the orders passed in any reassessment, where the
      total income determined in the original assessment order and the income
      that escaped assessment are clubbed together and assessed as the total
      income. In such a case, to reiterate, there is no question of any
      abatement of the earlier proceedings for the simple reason that no
      proceedings for assessment or reassessment were pending since they had
      already culminated in assessment or reassessment orders when the
      search was initiated or the requisition was made".

', 17.   Similar issue came up in Abhay Kumar Shroff (supra) wherein

Ther Lordships after considering the relevant provisions of the Act

(supra) and CBDT Circular (supra) have observed and held vide para 12

to 16 as under:-
', 

',       "12. From a bare reading of the provisions of ', sections 153A', , ', 153B',  and
      ', 153C',  of the Act and the Departmental Circular dated September 5, 2003
      (see [2003] 263 ITR (St.) 62), it is manifestly clear that after May 31,
      2003, the earlier provision of block assessment in the case of search
      initiated against the assessee, shall not apply. Instead, the provision
      that there shall be single assessment on undisclosed income comprising
      previous years relating to six assessment years preceding in which the
      search was conducted, shall apply. It further provides that the Assessing
      Officer shall issue notice to such person requiring him to furnish return
      of income in respect of six assessment years immediately preceding the
      assessment year relating to the previous year in which the search was
      conducted under ', section 132',  or requisition was made under ', section
      132A',  of the Act.

', 13.   The second proviso to ', section 153A',  makes it clear that
assessment or reassessment relating to any assessment year falling



within the period of six assessment years pending on the date of
initiation of the search under ', section 132',  or requisition under ', section
132A',  shall abate. In other words, if on the date of initiation of search or
requisition under ', section 132',  or ', section 132A',  any assessment or
reassessment proceeding is initiated relating to any assessment year
falling within the period of six assessment years, it shall stand abated
and the assessing authority cannot and shall not proceed with such
pending assessment after initiation of search or requisition as
contemplated hereinabove.
', 
', 14.   The word "abate" or "abatement" has not been defined in the Act
or in the circular. According to Chambers Dictionary the word "abate"
means demolition or to put an end to.
', 
', The Law Lexicon defines the word "abate", which means to throw down,
destroy or quash or to nullify. According to Black's Law Dictionary the
word "abatement" means the act of eliminating or nullifying or
suspension or defeat of a pending action.
', 

', According to Advanced Law Lexicon by P. Ramanathan Aiyar the word
"abate" means diminish or take away or to put end to or to come to a
naught. The term is used in the U. S. A. to describe the cancellation in
whole or in part of a Government levy (business term and international
accounting).
', 
', 15.     Coming back to the instant case, as noticed above, the search and
seizure was initiated by the respondents on August 24, 2006, which was
carried out by various authorised officials. Thereafter, as admitted by the
respondents in their counter affidavit, no notice as required under
', section 153A',  was issued to the petitioner for the six assessment years,
i.e., from 2001-02 to 2006-07. It has not been disputed by the
respondents that the date on which the search was initiated the
assessment proceeding was pending on the basis of the return furnished
by the petitioner. Consequently, therefore, the pending assessment
proceeding stood abated by virtue of the second proviso to ', section 153A', 
of the said Act. Instead of complying with the requirements of ', section
153A',  of the Act, the respondents            proceeded with the pending
assessment proceeding for the assessment year 2004-05 and passed an
assessment order during the pendency of the instant writ application.
The said impugned order has also been challenged by the petitioner by
filing amendment petition.
', 
', 16.    In the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the case, I am of the
definite opinion that the entire action of the respondents in proceeding

      with the assessment after search in contravention of the provisions of
      ', section 153A',  is vitiated in law. Consequently, the impugned assessment
      order dated December 28, 2006, purportedly passed under ', section
      143(3)',  of the Act in a pending assessment proceeding which stood
      abated is a nullity. As discussed above, continuation of the impugned
      assessment proceeding after the initiation of search without giving any
      notice under ', section 153A',  of the Act and passing the impugned final
      order of assessment is illegal, arbitrary and wholly without jurisdiction".
', 

', u"18.   Recently Their Lordships of Hon'ble Allahabad High Court in case

of Smt. Shaila Agarwal (supra) while considering the provisions of ", section

153A', u" of the Act and the meaning of words 'abate' and 'pending' referred

in the above provision have observed and held as under (headnote) :-
", 

',       "', Section 153A',  of the Income Tax Act, 1961, provides that where notice
      under this section is issued as a result of any search under ', section 132', ,
      assessment or reassessment, if any, relating to any assessment year
      falling within the period of six assessment years referred to under ', section
      153', , pending on the date of initiation of search under ', section 132',  or
      requisition under ', section 132A',  shall abate. The words "pending on the
      date of initiation of search under ', section 132',  or making of requisition
      under ', section 132A', , as the case may be," have to be assigned their
      simple and plain meaning. Where the assessment or reassessment is
      finalised, there are no pending proceedings to abate and be restored to
      the file of the Assessing Officer. The word "abatement" is referable to
      something which is pending, alive, or is subject to deduction. Abatement
      refers to suspension or termination of proceedings either of the main
      action, or proceedings ancillary or collateral to it. Proceedings which have
      already terminated are not liable for abatement unless the statute
      expressly provides for it. The word "pending" occurring in the second
      proviso to ', section 153A',  of the Act is qualified by the words "on the date
      of initiation of the search", and makes it abundantly clear that only such
      assessment or reassessment proceedings are liable to abate. The
      pendency of an appeal in the Tribunal against the order of assessment
      against which an appeal has been decided by the Commissioner
      (Appeals) is not a continuation of the proceedings of assessment. An
      appeal under the ', Income-tax Act',  lies to the Appellate Tribunal on a
      question of law. Even f it is pending on the date of search the
      reassessment proceedings will not abate. The abatement of any
      proceedings has serious effect inasmuch as it takes away all the
',                                        18         ITA No. 1074/PN/2007 &', 
                                                 ITA No. 5182/Mum/2007



      consequences that arise thereafter. The material found in the search may
      be a ground for notice and assessment under ', section 153A',  of the Act but
      that would not efface or terminate all the consequences, which arise out
      of the regular assessment or reassessment resulting in a demand or
      proceedings for penalty.
', 
',       The assessee filed a return for the assessment year 2002-03. She was
      required to produce evidence regarding gifts. He was unable to do so and
      hence an addition was made to her income. The Commissioner (Appeals)
      confirmed the addition. After the decision of the Commissioner (Appeals)
      search proceedings were initiated against the assessee. A notice under
      ', section 153A',  was issued to the assessee as a result of search and
      seizure, calling upon the assessee to file returns for six assessment years
      including the assessment year 2002-03. The Tribunal held that once a
      notice under ', section 153A',  had been issued after search and seizure
      operations, according to the provisions of ', section 153A', , all the
      assessments of the six preceding assessment years prior to the search
      abated. On appeal to the High Court:
', 
',       Held, that the assessment proceedings did not abate".
', 

', 19.   Similar issue came up before the Special Bench of this Tribunal (in

which, one of us was a party) and the Special Bench had an occasion to

deal with the scope of interpretation of ', section 153A', u" of the Act in the

case of in All Cargo Global Logistics Ltd. (supra). The Special Bench of

the Tribunal after considering the various decisions and CBDT circulars

including the Circular No. 7 of 2003 dtd. 5-9-2003 and the decision of

the Hon'ble Jharkhand High Court in Abhay Kumar Shroff (supra)

[mentioned in the list of cases/circulars] has held as under:-
", 

',       "52. The provision comes into operation if a search or requisition is
      initiated after 31.5.2003. On satisfaction of this condition, the AO is
      under obligation to issue notice to the person requiring him to furnish
      the return of income of six years immediately preceding the year of
      search. The word used is "shall" and, thus, there is no option but to
      issue such a notice. Thereafter he has to assess or reassess total income
      of these six years. In this respect also, the word used is "shall" and,
',                                  19        ITA No. 1074/PN/2007 &', 
                                          ITA No. 5182/Mum/2007



therefore, the AO has no option but to asses or reassess the total income
of these six years. The pending proceedings shall abate. This means that
out of six years, if any assessment or reassessment is pending on the
date of initiation of the search, it shall abate. In other words pending
proceedings will not be proceeded with thereafter. The assessment has
now to be made u/s 153A (1)(b) and the first proviso. It also means that
only one assessment will be made under the aforesaid provisions as the
two proceedings i.e. assessment or reassessment proceedings and
proceedings under this provision merged into one. If assessment made
under sub-section (1) is annulled in appeal or other legal proceedings,
then the abated assessment or reassessment shall revive. This means
that the assessment or reassessment, which had abated, shall be made,
for which extension of time has been provided under ', section 153B', .
', 
', 53.    The question now is - what is the scope of assessment or
reassessment of total income u/s 153A (1) (b) and the first proviso ? We
are of the view that for answering this question, guidance will have to be
sought from ', section 132(1)', . If any books of account or other documents
relevant to the assessment had not been produced in the course of
original assessment and found in the course of search in our humble
opinion such books of account or other documents have to be taken into
account while making assessment or reassessment of total income under
the aforesaid provision. Similar position will obtain in a case where
undisclosed income or undisclosed property has been found as a
consequence of search. In other words, harmonious interpretation will
produce the following results :-
', 
', a) In so far as pending assessments are concerned, the jurisdiction to
make original assessment and assessment u/s 153A merge into one and
only one assessment for each assessment year shall be made separately
on the basis of the findings of the search and any other material existing
or brought on the record of the A.O.
', 
', b)     in respect of non-abated assessments, the assessment will be
made on the basis of books of account or other documents not produced
in the course of original assessment but found in the course of search,
and undisclosed income or undisclosed property discovered in the course
of search."
', 
',              ......                  ........                ......
', 58. Thus, question No.1 before us is answered a) as under :
', (a)    In assessments that are abated, the A.O. retains the original
jurisdiction as well as jurisdiction conferred on him under',  s. 153A',  for
which assessments shall be made for each of the six assessment years
separately ;
', 
', b)    In other cases, in addition to the income that has already been
assesed, the asesment u/s 153A wil be made on the basis of
incriminating material, which in the context of relevant provisions means
',                                        20       ITA No. 1074/PN/2007 &', 
                                               ITA No. 5182/Mum/2007



',       - (i) books of account, other documents, found in the course of search
      but not produced in the course of original asessment, and (i) undisclosed
      income or property discovered in the course of search.
', 
',       59. Having come to this conclusion we need not go into various orders of
      the `Tribunal cited by the rival parties. The decisions inconsistent with
      the aforesaid view/conclusion stand disapproved and the decisions
      consistent with this view/conclusion are approved".
', 
', u"20.   Applying the ratio of the above decisions to the facts of the present

case, we find that the search and seizure was initiated by the

Department in assessee's case on 30-11-2006 on which date the

assessment for A.Y. 2004-05 was pending which was completed on 27-
", 
', 12-2006 u/s 143(3) of the Act. We further find that there is no dispute

that the assessee is covered under the search action u/s 132(1) of the

Act dtd.    30-11-2006. Consequently notice u/s 153', A of the Act',  was

issued to the assessee on 12-10-2007 and in response, the assessee filed

its return of income on 15-11-2007 declaring total income of Rs.
', 
', 1,64,50,999/-    as   against   the   income    originally   shown      at   Rs.
', 
', 1,62,08,636/- in the return filed u/s 139(1) of the Act. It is also not in

dispute that as on the date of search, the assessment proceeding for the

A.Y. 2004-05 was pending and the regular assessment was completed on

27-12-2006 vide order passed u/s 143(3) of the Act. The position thus

emerging is that where assessment proceedings are pending completion

when the search is initiated, the pending assessment proceeding stood

abated by virtue of the second proviso to ', section 153A',  of the Act.
', 
', Instead of complying with the requirements of ', section 153A',  of the Act,

the A.O. proceeded with the pending assessment proceeding for the A.Y.

2004-05 and passed the impugned assessment order during the

pendency of the assessment u/s 153', A of the Act',  which is a nullity and

as such the assessment order dtd. 27-12-2006 passed u/s 143(3) of the

Act is illegal, arbitrary, wholly without jurisdiction and, hence, the same

is quashed.
', 

', 21.   As regards the plea of the ld. D.R. that in the assessment order

passed      u/s   153', A    of   the    Act', ,   the    A.O.    has    made     the

additions/disallowances on the basis of the impugned assessment order

passed u/s 143(3) of the Act, therefore, on equitable ground, the said

additions may remain to be considered as made in the assessment order

passed u/s 153', A of the Act', , we find that it is a settled law that where

there is no ambiguity and the intention of the legislature is clearly

conveyed, there is no scope for the court to undertake any exercise to

read something into the provisions which the legislature in its wisdom

concisely omitted.    Such an exercise is undertaken by the court may

amount to amending or altering statutory provisions. The courts have to

decide what the law is and not what it should be. For this proposition,

reliance is also placed on the following decisions:-
', 

',       (1)     ', In Union of India vs. Deoki Nandan Aggarwal', u" (1992) Supp. 1 SCC
      323, a three judge Bench of Hon'ble Supreme Court held that it is not
      the duty of the Court either to enlarge the scope of legislation or the
      intention of the Legislature, when the language of the provision is plain.", 
',       The Court cannot rewrite the legislation for the reason that it had no

power to legislate. The power to legislate has not been conferred on the
Courts. The Court cannot add words to a statute or read words into it
which are not there.
', 
', (2)    ', In State of Kerala vs. Mathai Verghese',  (1986) 4 SCC 746, the
Hon'ble Supreme Court has reiterated the well-settled position that the
Court can merely interpret the section; it cannot rewrite, recast or
redesign the section.      In interpreting the provision the exercise
undertaken by the Court is to make explicit the intention of the
Legislature which enacted the legislation.     It is not for the Court to
reframe the legislation for the very good reason that the powers to
"legislate" have not been conferred on the Court.
', 
', (3)    ', In Gwalior Rayons Silk Mfg. (Wvg.) Co. Ltd. vs. Custodian of
Vested Forests', u" (1990) (Supp) SCC 785 the Hon'ble Supreme Court
observed that in seeking legislative intention Judges not only listen to the
voice of the Legislature but also listen attentively to what the Legislature
does not say.
", 
', u"4.     The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of ", Federation of Andhra
Pradesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry v. State of Andhra
Pradesh',  reported in [2001] 247 ITR 36 (SC) reiterated the basic principle
that (page 39):-
', 
',         "it is trite law that a taxing statute has to be strictly construed
       and nothing can be read into it..... In a taxing Act one has to look
       merely at what is clearly said.        There is no room for any
       intendment. There is no equity about a tax. There is no
       presumption as to a tax. Nothing is to be read in, nothing is to be
       implied. One can look fairly at the language used." The Hon'ble
       Supreme Court further went on to hold that (page 39) "the courts
       in interpreting a taxing statute will not be justified in adding
       words thereto so as to make out some presumed object of the
       Legislature...... If the legislature has failed to clarify its meaning
       by the use of the appropriate language, the benefit thereof must go
       to the taxpayer. It is settled law that in case of doubt, that
       interpretation of a taxing statute which is beneficial to the
       taxpayer must be adopted."

            it is the bounden duty and obligation of the Court to interpret the
            statute as it is. It is contrary to all rules of construction to read
            words into a statute which the legislature in its wisdom has
            deliberately not incorporated."

', 22.   Respectfully following the above settled position of law, the plea

taken by the ld. D.R. is devoid of any merit and, hence, rejected.
', 

', 23.   Since we have quashed the impugned assessment order on the

legal ground raised by the assessee, therefore, we do not consider it

necessary to discuss the grounds raised by the assessee and Revenue on

merits of the additions sustained/relief allowed. Accordingly the other

grounds taken by the assessee and Revenue are rejected.

Revenue's appeal is dismissed.",
