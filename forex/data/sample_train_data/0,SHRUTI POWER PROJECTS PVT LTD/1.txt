achieving sustainable development while conserving natural resources
that have been depleted due to the rapid growth in population,
urbanization, and fossil fuel consumption.', Wind Energy is where India competes globally in manufacturing and
deployment in the present scenario.  Wind has emerged as the most
promising renewable energy source in India. Our Policy framework in
wind energy generation is extremely investor-friendly and an attractive

of the sector.', The Indian renewable energy sector has shown impressive growth in the
past few years and investments into the sector have increased
significantly. The Indian power sector has immense opportunities in

happiest when it comes to electricity.  Anyone visiting Gujarat
appreciates the stark difference in the quality of the electricity
supply between Gujarat and rest of the country.', Gujarat state has enormous potential for wind power generation. The
average velocity of wind in the state is just less than seven meters
per second, which is very much suitable for wind power generation.
Gujarat has the benefit of plenty of land available for wind power
generation mainly in the Kutch region.  Industry experts said wind
velocity in the range of 6-7 meters per second is best suitable for the
wind power generation. This is available in Gujarat due to winds
blowing from Arabian Sea and in desert area of Kutch.', The Company is pleased to inform that in the state of Rajasthan, it has

Corporation Limited (RRECL).', INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS', The Company has in place adequate internal financial controls with
