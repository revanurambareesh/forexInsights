						', Manappuram Loan Against Property FAQs', 
							', How is availing a loan against property different from other loans like Personal Loan?', 
							', A loan against property is sanctioned by mortgaging the property of the customer with the bank or other financial institution. A personal loan is solely approved on the basis of the applicant\u2019s income stability. Credit cards and personal loans are expensive forms of credit due to the relatively high interest rates. A loan against property is different in the sense that it is secured by your property. Compared to personal loans and credit cards, it has lower  interest rates  because it is a secured loan and the lender\u2019s money is safeguarded by the property pledged as collateral. Personal loans and credit card borrowings are unsecured and therefore usually carry a higher rate of interest because of the risk involved in lending the money. ', 
							', Are there any end-use restrictions of the loan secured by mortgaging my property?', 
							', There is no such restriction, provided that the end use of the loan is legal. You could use the loan to fund your business, as a working capital, to expand your business, for your child\u2019s marriage, or for your personal needs.   ', 
							', What is the tenure range?', 
							', You can repay your loan over a tenure that ranges between 2-7 years. ', 
							', What is the maximum loan amount I can avail?', 
							', You can avail a maximum loan amount of Rs. 2 crores, depending on the value of your property, your income and other factors.',

							', You need to submit your application form along with all the supporting documents. Once you do that, the loan is sanctioned upon successful verification of the documents in question.  All loan approvals are at the sole discretion of Manappuram Finance. ',

						', Manappuram Loan Against Property FAQs', 
							', How is availing a loan against property different from other loans like Personal Loan?', 
							', A loan against property is sanctioned by mortgaging the property of the customer with the bank or other financial institution. A personal loan is solely approved on the basis of the applicant\u2019s income stability. Credit cards and personal loans are expensive forms of credit due to the relatively high interest rates. A loan against property is different in the sense that it is secured by your property. Compared to personal loans and credit cards, it has lower  interest rates  because it is a secured loan and the lender\u2019s money is safeguarded by the property pledged as collateral. Personal loans and credit card borrowings are unsecured and therefore usually carry a higher rate of interest because of the risk involved in lending the money. ', 
							', Are there any end-use restrictions of the loan secured by mortgaging my property?', 
							', There is no such restriction, provided that the end use of the loan is legal. You could use the loan to fund your business, as a working capital, to expand your business, for your child\u2019s marriage, or for your personal needs.   ', 
							', What is the tenure range?', 
							', You can repay your loan over a tenure that ranges between 2-7 years. ', 
							', What is the maximum loan amount I can avail?', 
							', You can avail a maximum loan amount of Rs. 2 crores, depending on the value of your property, your income and other factors.',

							', You need to submit your application form along with all the supporting documents. Once you do that, the loan is sanctioned upon successful verification of the documents in question.  All loan approvals are at the sole discretion of Manappuram Finance. ',
