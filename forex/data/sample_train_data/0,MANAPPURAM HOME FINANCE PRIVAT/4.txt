The loan amount is instantly credited to the your savings bank account registered with us. The loan is disbursed on the basis of the value of Gold already pledged at a branch.

                Through OGL only one loan can be disbursed at a time. However, the customer can take a new loan at any point of time after closing the old loan account. There are no restrictions on taking a new loan after closing the old loan. For example, a customer with an existing loan who desires to obtain a loan of higher amount within his overall eligibility, will be permitted the same. In this case, the system will close the existing loan account from the proceeds of the new loan of the higher amount and the difference will be credited to the customer\u2019s bank account. In this way, each customer will have only one live loan account.	        ',

Each loan scheme will have its own limits, rate of interest rate, period of the loan etc. In other words, the Loan limit will depend on the scheme selected by the customer when availing the OGL. However, there is a company wide exposure limit for loans to individuals based on the loan policy approved by the Board of the company.

	        	OGL, or Online Gold Loan, is a new product launched by Manappuram Finance Limited. With OGL, you can obtain a gold loan anytime, from any place. The loan amount is instantly credited to the your savings bank account registered with us. The loan is disbursed on the basis of the value of Gold already pledged at a branch.

                Through OGL only one loan can be disbursed at a time. However, the customer can take a new loan at any point of time after closing the old loan account. There are no restrictions on taking a new loan after closing the old loan. For example, a customer with an existing loan who desires to obtain a loan of higher amount within his overall eligibility, will be permitted the same. In this case, the system will close the existing loan account from the proceeds of the new loan of the higher amount and the difference will be credited to the customer\u2019s bank account. In this way, each customer will have only one live loan account.	        ',

The OTP is generated at the time of confirmation of OGL transaction after the customer has logged in through the customer`s User ID and Password. The OGL pawn ticket also records the date and time of the transaction, and the IP number of the system through which the customer has transacted.
