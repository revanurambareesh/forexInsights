', What is a Systematic Investment Plan?', 
', Systematic Investment Plan is an approach to investing within managed investments which involves investing a set of amount at regular intervals rather than investing a larger lump sum amount in one shot. By investing this way you are not attempting to capture the highs and lows of the market but rather the cost of your investment is averaged over a period of time. The essence of SIPs is that when the markets fall investors automatically acquire more units. Likewise they acquire lesser units when the market rises. This means that you buy less when the price is high whereas you buy more the price is low. Hence the average cost per unit drops down over a period of time.',

', What is a Systematic Investment Plan?', 
', Systematic Investment Plan is an approach to investing within managed investments which involves investing a set of amount at regular intervals rather than investing a larger lump sum amount in one shot. By investing this way you are not attempting to capture the highs and lows of the market but rather the cost of your investment is averaged over a period of time. The essence of SIPs is that when the markets fall investors automatically acquire more units. Likewise they acquire lesser units when the market rises. This means that you buy less when the price is high whereas you buy more the price is low. Hence the average cost per unit drops down over a period of time.',
