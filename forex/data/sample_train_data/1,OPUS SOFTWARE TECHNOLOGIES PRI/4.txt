', OPUS, originally an acronym for the Online Publikationsverbund der Universität Stuttgart, was developed with the support of the ', Deutsches Forschungsnetz',  in 1997 and 1998 at the ', University of Stuttgart', . OPUS is used at many universities and library networks.', [1]',  Since December 2010, the ', Cooperative Library Network of Berlin-Brandenburg (KOBV)',  took over the development and management of the project at the ', Zuse Institute',  in ', Berlin', . In ', Germany', , the OPUS software is the most commonly used for the operation of open access repositories (according to a survey carried out in 2012,', [2]',  77 repositories were based on OPUS). OPUS-based repositories may either be hosted and operated by universities on their own, or as part of hosting services provided by the German library network. The KOBV provides hosting for more than 35 instances of OPUS.', [3]',  Apart from Germany, OPUS is also used in Serbia by two research institutes.', [4]', 
', Development', [', edit', ]', 
', The current version, OPUS 4, is being developed by the Cooperative Library Network Berlin-Brandenburg at the Zuse Institute Berlin.', 
', The earlier development was coordinated by the ', Library Service Centre for Baden-Württemberg',  and the ', Stuttgart University',  Library.

', Technology', [', edit', ]', 
', OPUS 3.x was written in ', PHP',  4. The current version, OPUS 4, is developed in PHP (version 5.3) and is based on the ', Zend Framework',  and the search engine ', Solr', . Data are stored in a ', MySQL',  database. Both versions are designed for ', LAMP',  environments.',

', 
', OPUS is a simple repository system for various types of objects and formats. These can be deposited, managed and provided with descriptive information (', metadata', ) via a web interface. The objects themselves are not processed on the server side except for full-text search. Metadata can be harvested by different search engines (e.g ', OAI service providers', , ', Google Scholar', , ', WorldCat', ).', 
', OPUS supports Uniform Resource Names (URN) for persistent identification of objects.', 
', OPUS has a ', license',  module; various types of licenses (', Digital Peer Publishing', , ', Creative Commons', , etc.) can be set up.', 
', OPUS supports ', OAI-PMH 2.0 protocol', .', 
', OPUS supports XmetaDiss, the metadata set of the ', German National Library',  for online ', dissertations',  and post-doctoral theses.',
