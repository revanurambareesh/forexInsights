', Published on ', 28/05/2015, 4:45pm', 
', Desert state has abundance of sunshine and could produce more than it consumes, says power company boss', 
', (Pic: Activ Solar/Flickr)', 
', By ', Ed King',  in Barcelona', 
', Hopes that Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s top crude oil producer, could soon become a top solar energy exporter are well founded, according the head of one of the country\u2019s leading power firms.', 
', \u201cSaudi could be a solar exporter \u2013 I think it\u2019s absolutely realistic and it\u2019s going to happen,\u201d said Paddy Padmanathan, CEO of ACWA Power, which runs a portfolio of solar, coal, gas and desalination plants across the Middle East.', 
', In the short term, he said it was likely solar would fill the gaps in fast rising demand in the country, 10-11% a year in what is now a 50 GW grid.', 
', \u201cWithin a decade I have a suspicion we will produce a significant amount of electricity using renewable energy and particularly solar \u2013 but we will consume it.\u201d', 
', \u201cThere will come a time when we have enough capacity for exports\u2026 the minute we start looking across a broader mix of countries we can start looking at time zone differences.\u201d', 
', 
', Last week Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil minister \u2013 who also heads the country\u2019s climate planning \u2013 said the government planned to be a \u201cglobal leader in solar and wind energy\u201d.', 
', \u201cIn Saudi Arabia, we recognise that eventually, one of these days, we are not going to need fossil fuels. I don\u2019t know when, in 2040, 2050 or thereafter,\u201d he told a conference in Paris.', 
', Padmanathan\u2019s company recently made headlines after promising to deliver solar power at one of the lowest prices on the planet \u2013 5.98 cents per kilowatt hour.', 
', The 200MW project in Dubai \u2013 secured with a US$344 million loan from three Saudi banks \u2013 is evidence of the potential solar has in the region, he said.', 
', \u201cPricing is coming down and this is immediately changing the midst \u2013 everyone is out there looking at new targets.', 
', \u201cI think in 2020 we\u2019re going to look back and say \u2013 if we pick one year as a point of inflexion \u2013 I\u2019m very confident it will be 2015.\u201d', 
', ACWA runs a portfolio of solar, coal, gas and desalination plants across the Middle East, and is also planning further fossil fuel investments.', 
', Still, Padmanathan insisted that the prospect of a global climate deal later this year in Paris would accelerate renewables growth.', 
', \u201cIt is cost competitive already \u2013 what we want to see is if we can get there faster,\u201d he said.', 
', \u201cWhat the private sector is looking from policymakers [in Paris] is a clear commitment to accepting renewable energy into the mix.', 
', \u201cWhether they pick 5% or 50% it doesn\u2019t really matter \u2013 but they need to come out and pick a target and give a convincing commitment.', 
', \u201cThat is what is going to allow the private sector confidence in a market to invest in innovation and make it more affordable.\u201d',

', If households producing power and send it into the grid, the power company says that they can not regulate that extra power that goes into the grid and it will create all kinds of problems and they even charge a fee for households with solar panels if they send power into the grid.', 
But\u2026.it is ironic that the same power companies are installing and operating Mega watts of solar panels and that will not cause any problems.', 
Also in states where power companies do not have to pay for solar power send into the grid, such solar power that goes into the grid is not a problem either if power companies are getting it for free.',

', 
',

', 
',

', It is to much politics involved in the US, that is the reason solar is moving slow.',

', 
', Steven Geiger', 
', 
', 
', 
', I have the greatest respect for such an accomplished visionary as Paddy. But whether significant solar electricity exports from the Kingdom will happen needs much more investigation. The greatest benefit of renewables is allowing countries to finally wean themselves off the dangerous dependency and costs of imported energy. Countries can now aspire to much greater security and energy independence due to rapidly-dropping prices and increasing financial innovation facilitating massive worldwide deployments. Countries can now keep all that money at home, investing in their own industries and people.', 
', It is not clear at all that the insolation advantage of KSA will be enough incentive for other countries to forgo these new-found freedoms, energy security, and balance of trade. The high cost of laying long-distance HV cables is also a factor.', 
', Certainly regional exports into the GCC grid are likely, and perhaps into other neighboring countries.',
