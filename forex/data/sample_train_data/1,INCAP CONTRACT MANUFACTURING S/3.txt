', 
', Per Shri Vijay Pal Rao, J.M. :
', 
',      These three appeals by the assessee are directed against the composite

order of Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) dt.16.7.2014 for the

Assessment Year 2009-10 to 2011-12.
', 
', 2.     The assessee has raised common grounds in these appeals. The grounds

raised for the Assessment Year 2009-10 are as under :
',                                                  2', 
',                                                                   ITA Nos.1469 to 1471/Bang/2014


 " 1   The order of the learned CIT(A) is based on incorrect interpretation of law and
       facts and therefore is erroneous and bad in law.
', 
',  Grounds relating to corporate tax matters

 2     The learned CIT(A) has erred in law and in facts, by disallowing depreciation on
       customer relationship rights (non-compete      fees) which was considered as an
       intangible asset by the Appellant. This asset was acquired by the Appellant as a part
       of business transfer agreement with MIS TVS Electronics Ltd.

 3     The learned CIT(A) has erred in law and in facts, by failing to appreciate that the
       expression "any other business or commercial right of similar nature" would include
       such "Customer Relationship Rights (Non-compete fees)", which is essential to carry
       on the business after the business transfer.
', 
',  4     The learned CIT(A) has erred in law and in facts, by not giving the Appellant the
       advantage of ruling held in the following cases:
', 
',        i)     by The Honourable Karnataka High Court in ', CIT vs. Ingersoll Rand
              International Ind.Ltd', .
',        ii)    by the ITAT Chennai Bench in ITO Vs Medicorp Technologies India Ltd
               (2009) 30 SOT 506

 5     The learned CIT(A) has erred in law and in facts, by differentiating the Customer
       relationship rights (non-compete fees) from any other business or commercial rights.
       The Appellant has claimed depreciation on Customer Rights on the understanding
       that the consideration was paid to TVS Electronics Ltd to acquire certain commercial
       rights, including these customer relationship right, which are in the nature of intangible
       capital assets and essential for carrying on the business. Thus these rights qualify to
       be a part of "any other business or commercial rights" as mentioned under Section
       32(1 )(ii) of the ', Income-tax Act', , 1961 and hence eligible for depreciation. On acquiring
       the business from TVS Electronics Ltd for a slump price on a going concern basis a
       part of the consideration was bonafide allocated towards "Customer Rights" in the
       Appellants      books of accounts. The price was paid for marketing and trading
       reputation, trading style, territory know-how, customer database, distribution network,
       contracts, refraining the seller from entering the same business and eventually
       soliciting Appellants customers and other commercial rights. The finding of the learned
       CIT(A) that these customer relationship rights are different from "any other business or
       commercial rights" and hence not eligible for depreciation is erroneous and contrary
       to law.
',  Further, the Appellant craves leave to add, alter, vary, omit, substitute or amend the above
 grounds of appeal, at any time before, or at the time of, hearing of the appeal.

On the above grounds and such other grounds that may be urged at the time of hearing, the
appellant prays that the appeal may be allowed in full."
',                                          3', 
',                                                        ITA Nos.1469 to 1471/Bang/2014

', u"3.        The assessee company is engaged in the business of providing

comprehensive contract manufacture services to the leading equipment

manufacturers and development of renewable energy like solar energy. The

assessee entered into a Business Transfer Agreement (BTA) with TVS

Electronics (Seller) on 31.5.2007 to purchase the business of Contract

Manufacturing Services ('CMS') Division as a going concern. The CMS was

purchased by the assessee for a total consideration of Rs.42.33 Crores. The

assessee in its return of income claimed a sum of Rs.1,26,54,563 as

depreciation on customer right taking it as being on par with goodwill or non-

compete rights. The Assessing Officer was of the view that the customer

relationship right does not fall under the expression of similar nature used in

", Section 32(1)(ii)', u" of the Act to the term patent, copy right, trade mark, business

and franchise.   Thus the Assessing Officer held that applying the Doctrine of

ejusdem generis the expression 'customer relationship right'            cannot be

considered as another business or commercial rights of similar nature of

patent, copy right, trade mark businesses and franchise as used in ", Section

32(1)(ii)',  of the Act. Thus the Assessing Officer held that the payment made in

respect of customer relationship right is only in the nature of goodwill for which
',                                          4', u"
                                                       ITA Nos.1469 to 1471/Bang/2014

no depreciation was allowable. Accordingly, the Assessing Officer denied the

benefit of depreciation on the amount paid in respect of customer relationship

right and brought to tax the said amount for all the assessment years under

consideration. The assessee challenged the action of the Assessing Officer

before the CIT (Appeals).     The CIT (Appeals) confirmed the action of the

Assessing Officer in disallowing depreciation on the said amount by following

the judgment of Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of Sharp Business System

Vs. CIT (2013) 211 Taxman 576.
", 
', 4.      Before us, the learned Authorise Representative of the assessee has

submitted that as per ', Article 11',  of the Business Transfer Agreement (BTA), the

seller agreed and undertook that it was not directly or indirectly for a period of

three years (i) participate or engage in any jurisdiction or in any capacity in

Contract Manufacturing Services (CMS) business and contract manufacturing

related to medical and power electronics and (ii) Solicit / entics the employee

of the CMS business of buyer of the assessee (buyer). Thus the payment made

by the assessee is for getting a vested right, which can be enforced under law

and without that other business man could compete with the assessee. The

learned Authorised Representative has submitted that the payment of non-
',                                          5', 
',                                                        ITA Nos.1469 to 1471/Bang/2014

compete is for acquiring a number of rights such as restricting the seller directly

or indirectly participating in the business similar to the assessee as acquired or

directly or indirectly soliciting the claim or customers of the existing business.

Thus the learned Authorised Representative has submitted that the payment

has been made for acquiring a commercial / business right is a valuable right.

The learned Authorised Representative has also referred the notes to accounts

and submitted that the contract manufacturing service division has been

purchased as a going concern and it was transferred to the assessee for a

purchase consideration of Rs.42.33 Crores. Thereafter the company engaged

external consultants to undertake fair valuation of fixed asset and intangibles

taken over from TVS Electronics Limited. Accordingly, as per the consultant,

the purchase price has been allocated to various assets including intangibles.

As per the share valuation a sum of Rs.6.7491 Crores has been allocated to

customer relationship right and a sum of Rs.2.55 Crores has been allocated to

goodwill. The learned Authorised Representative has pointed out that since it

was lumpsum sale for transfer of on going concern therefore no value was

assigned to the specific assets in the agreement but the purchase consideration

was agreed between parties on lumpsum basis. The learned A.R. has contended
',                                         6', u"
                                                     ITA Nos.1469 to 1471/Bang/2014

that the CIT (Appeals) has relied upon the decision of Hon'ble Delhi High Court

in the Sharp Business System (supra) whereas the jurisdictional High Court in

the subsequent judgment in the case of CIT Vs. Ingersoll Rand International

India Ltd. 48 taxmann.com 349 (Kar) has decided this issue of depreciation on

non-compete fees in favour of the assessee.           He learned Authorised

Representative has pointed out that Hon'ble High Court after considering the

judgment of Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of Sharp Business System

(supra) has decided this issue. Therefore, in view of the judgment of Hon'ble

jurisdictional High Court, the issue is now covered in favour of the assessee.

He has also relied upon the judgment of Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of

Areva T & D India Ltd. V DCIT (2012) 345 ITR 421 and submitted that in an

identical case there was a lump sum sale, the Hon'ble Delhi High Court has held

that the intangible assets in the nature of business information, business

record, contract, employees and know-how fall in the genus of intangible

assets that form part of the tool of trade of assessee facilitating smooth

carrying on the business and therefore eligible for depreciation under ", Section

31(1)(ii)',  of the Act.
',                                          7', 
',                                                        ITA Nos.1469 to 1471/Bang/2014

', u"5.        On the other hand, the learned Departmental Representative has

submitted that neither anything mentioned in the BTA nor in the arrangement

between parties which can indicate that there was any transfer of intangible

asset in the transaction of contract manufacture service division of TVS

Electronics Ltd.. Further, the term 'customer relationship right' does not find

place in ", Section 32(1)(ii)', u" and this term also not similar to the terms of know

how, patent, copy right, trade mark, business or franchise. Therefore, in view

of the judgment of Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of Sharp Business

System (supra), the payments made by the assessee on account of business

relationship right or non-compete fees is not eligible for depreciation.

", 6.     We have heard the rival submissions as well as considered the relevant

material on record. The transaction of purchase of contract manufacturing

service division of TVS Electronics Ltd. by the assessee vide BTA dt.31.5.2007 is

slump sale as the consideration was agreed and paid in lump sum without

assigning any value to specific assets. Therefore as per the agreement the

consideration was paid lump sum without giving any details of payment for any

specific assets.   The business was purchased by the assessee and it was

transferred by the TVS Electronics as an on going business/division. However,
',                                         8', 
                                                     ITA Nos.1469 to 1471/Bang/2014

in its books of accounts the assessee has valued the fixed asset and intangibles

as per the valuation made by the consultants as under :
', 
',                                                      (in Rs. Million)
           Land                                      29.013
           Building                                  15.286
           Plant and Machinery                       39.230
           Other Fixed Assets                        14.076
           Inventory
',               - Raw material                         92.062
',               - Finished and semi-finished goods     23.368
           Debtors                                   97.793
           Loans and Advances                        45.410
           Total Assets                              356.238
           Current Liabilities and Proivsions        79.571
           Net Assets taken over                     276.667
           Advance for building                      53.614
           Customer Relationships                    67.491
           Goodwill                                  25.563
           Total value of assets taken over (Net)    423.335


Thus it is clear that the excess amount paid by the assessee over and above the

value assigned to the various assets had been assigned to two intangibles

namely "customer relationship" and "goodwill". The assessee did not claim any

depreciation on the value of Rs.2.55 Crores assigned to the goodwill and

therefore the same was not an issue before the authorities below.             The

assessee claimed depreciation in respect of the amount of Rs.6.74 Crores which
',                                        9', 
                                                    ITA Nos.1469 to 1471/Bang/2014

was assigned to customer relationship (intangible). The assessee took a plea

that this amount was paid as non-compete fees as the seller has expressed,

agreed and undertook not to participate or engage in any jurisdiction as a

owner or partner or as shareholder or in any capacity in the business of

contract manufacturing services which was transferred to the assessee. Thus

the learned Authorised Representative has referred to the ', Article 11',  of BTA in

support of his contention that the payment was made for non-compete fees.
', 
', However, in the absence of any agreement between the parties for any

consideration on account of non-compete fees as well as in the absence of any

such value assigned to the non-compete fees in the books of accounts, we do

not find any substance in the contention of the learned Authorised

Representative that the said payment is made as non-compete fees. The

assessee in its books of accounts has allocated sum to the intangible being

customer relationship. Therefore, though the seller has agreed not to engage

in any business for a period of three years or participate or engage as owner,

partner shareholder, consultant, advisor or any other capacity solicit the

employees of the CMS Business however in the absence of any intention of

parties to pay consideration for such restrictive covenants in the agreement
',                                         10', u"
                                                      ITA Nos.1469 to 1471/Bang/2014

the payment in question cannot be regarded as non-compete fees. Therefore,

the decision of the Hon'ble jurisdictional High Court in the case of Ingersoll

Rand International India Ltd. (supra) will not help the case of the assessee. As

regards the nature of payment in question, as treated by the assessee in the

books of accounts being customer relationship, the issue is clearly decided

against the assessee by the decision of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case

of Sharp Business System (supra). However, this can be looked from another

angle because the Assessing Officer while denying the claim of depreciation has

taken a view that the customer relationship rights are in the nature of goodwill

as under :
", 
', "The submissions made by company are considered. The assessee has relied
upon ', section 32(1)(ii)',  of the Income Tax Act, stating that the wordings äny other
business or commercial rights of similar nature" gives scope to many such
business or commercial rights including customer relationship rights which are
as per assessee almost in nature of goodwill. Hence there is no dispute that
customer relationship rights are in nature of goodwill."

Therefore the claim of the assessee is required to be considered by treating the

said payment as goodwill.     The learned Authorised Representative of the

assessee has relied upon the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of

CIT Vs. Smsifs Securities Ltd. 348 ITR 302 and submitted that in view of the said
',                                               11', u"
                                                               ITA Nos.1469 to 1471/Bang/2014

judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, goodwill eligible for depreciation as

per the ", Section 31(1)(ii)',  of the Act.             Since the assessee did not claim

depreciation on goodwill in the return of income and even not made any claim

before the CIT (Appeals). Therefore, the issue of allowing depreciation on

goodwill has not been examined by the authorities below.

', 7.    The assessee has also raised additional ground in respect of depreciation

on goodwill as under :
', 
', " The learned CIT(A) has failed to appreciate that the customer relationship rights
(non-compete fees) are akin to any other business or commercial rights and therefore eligible
for depreciation under the provisions of ', Section 32(1)(ii)', u" of the Act.

Additional Ground of Appeal No 1

Without prejudice to the Appellant's contention that depreciation should be allowed on the
non-compete fees, the learned Assessing Officer / Commissioner of Income-tax (Appeals)
have erred in law and facts in not allowing the non-compete fees paid by the Appellant as
revenue expenditure since the same has been incurred wholly and exclusively for the
purpose of the business.
", 
', Additional Ground of Appeal No 2

The learned Assessing Officer has erred in law, and in facts, in not allowing depreciation on
goodwill      as    per     ', Section     32(1)(ii)',    of     the     Act,     amounting       to
Rs.5,992,765 i.e 25% of the written down value of the total goodwill amounting to
Rs 31,961,412, which arose on account of acquisition of the Contract Manufacturing Services
division of TVS Electronics Limited under a slump sale arrangement by executing a Business
Transfer Agreement."
', 
', u"8.     We have heard the rival submissions as well as considered the relevant

material on record. The issue of 'depreciation' on goodwill is a legal issue and

does not require any further investigation of fact as the Assessing Officer has
",                                           12', 
                                                        ITA Nos.1469 to 1471/Bang/2014

not disputed or disturbed the valuation allocated/assigned by the assessee in

the books of accounts to the fixed assets and intangibles including goodwill.

Therefore in the facts and circumstances of the case and in the interest of

justice, we admit the additional ground raised by the assessee. Since this issue

has been raised for the first time by the assessee before us, therefore we set

aside this issue to the record of the Assessing Officer for deciding the same as

per law.
', 
', 8.   In the result, the appeal of the assessee is allowed for statistical purpose.

', 
', Per Shri Vijay Pal Rao, J.M. :
', 
',      These three appeals by the assessee are directed against the composite

order of Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) dt.16.7.2014 for the

Assessment Year 2009-10 to 2011-12.
', 
', 2.     The assessee has raised common grounds in these appeals. The grounds

raised for the Assessment Year 2009-10 are as under :
',                                                  2', 
',                                                                   ITA Nos.1469 to 1471/Bang/2014


 " 1   The order of the learned CIT(A) is based on incorrect interpretation of law and
       facts and therefore is erroneous and bad in law.
', 
',  Grounds relating to corporate tax matters

 2     The learned CIT(A) has erred in law and in facts, by disallowing depreciation on
       customer relationship rights (non-compete      fees) which was considered as an
       intangible asset by the Appellant. This asset was acquired by the Appellant as a part
       of business transfer agreement with MIS TVS Electronics Ltd.

 3     The learned CIT(A) has erred in law and in facts, by failing to appreciate that the
       expression "any other business or commercial right of similar nature" would include
       such "Customer Relationship Rights (Non-compete fees)", which is essential to carry
       on the business after the business transfer.
', 
',  4     The learned CIT(A) has erred in law and in facts, by not giving the Appellant the
       advantage of ruling held in the following cases:
', 
',        i)     by The Honourable Karnataka High Court in ', CIT vs. Ingersoll Rand
              International Ind.Ltd', .
',        ii)    by the ITAT Chennai Bench in ITO Vs Medicorp Technologies India Ltd
               (2009) 30 SOT 506

 5     The learned CIT(A) has erred in law and in facts, by differentiating the Customer
       relationship rights (non-compete fees) from any other business or commercial rights.
       The Appellant has claimed depreciation on Customer Rights on the understanding
       that the consideration was paid to TVS Electronics Ltd to acquire certain commercial
       rights, including these customer relationship right, which are in the nature of intangible
       capital assets and essential for carrying on the business. Thus these rights qualify to
       be a part of "any other business or commercial rights" as mentioned under Section
       32(1 )(ii) of the ', Income-tax Act', , 1961 and hence eligible for depreciation. On acquiring
       the business from TVS Electronics Ltd for a slump price on a going concern basis a
       part of the consideration was bonafide allocated towards "Customer Rights" in the
       Appellants      books of accounts. The price was paid for marketing and trading
       reputation, trading style, territory know-how, customer database, distribution network,
       contracts, refraining the seller from entering the same business and eventually
       soliciting Appellants customers and other commercial rights. The finding of the learned
       CIT(A) that these customer relationship rights are different from "any other business or
       commercial rights" and hence not eligible for depreciation is erroneous and contrary
       to law.
',  Further, the Appellant craves leave to add, alter, vary, omit, substitute or amend the above
 grounds of appeal, at any time before, or at the time of, hearing of the appeal.

On the above grounds and such other grounds that may be urged at the time of hearing, the
appellant prays that the appeal may be allowed in full."
',                                          3', 
',                                                        ITA Nos.1469 to 1471/Bang/2014

', u"3.        The assessee company is engaged in the business of providing

comprehensive contract manufacture services to the leading equipment

manufacturers and development of renewable energy like solar energy. The

assessee entered into a Business Transfer Agreement (BTA) with TVS

Electronics (Seller) on 31.5.2007 to purchase the business of Contract

Manufacturing Services ('CMS') Division as a going concern. The CMS was

purchased by the assessee for a total consideration of Rs.42.33 Crores. The

assessee in its return of income claimed a sum of Rs.1,26,54,563 as

depreciation on customer right taking it as being on par with goodwill or non-

compete rights. The Assessing Officer was of the view that the customer

relationship right does not fall under the expression of similar nature used in

", Section 32(1)(ii)', u" of the Act to the term patent, copy right, trade mark, business

and franchise.   Thus the Assessing Officer held that applying the Doctrine of

ejusdem generis the expression 'customer relationship right'            cannot be

considered as another business or commercial rights of similar nature of

patent, copy right, trade mark businesses and franchise as used in ", Section

32(1)(ii)',  of the Act. Thus the Assessing Officer held that the payment made in

respect of customer relationship right is only in the nature of goodwill for which
',                                          4', u"
                                                       ITA Nos.1469 to 1471/Bang/2014

no depreciation was allowable. Accordingly, the Assessing Officer denied the

benefit of depreciation on the amount paid in respect of customer relationship

right and brought to tax the said amount for all the assessment years under

consideration. The assessee challenged the action of the Assessing Officer

before the CIT (Appeals).     The CIT (Appeals) confirmed the action of the

Assessing Officer in disallowing depreciation on the said amount by following

the judgment of Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of Sharp Business System

Vs. CIT (2013) 211 Taxman 576.
", 
', 4.      Before us, the learned Authorise Representative of the assessee has

submitted that as per ', Article 11',  of the Business Transfer Agreement (BTA), the

seller agreed and undertook that it was not directly or indirectly for a period of

three years (i) participate or engage in any jurisdiction or in any capacity in

Contract Manufacturing Services (CMS) business and contract manufacturing

related to medical and power electronics and (ii) Solicit / entics the employee

of the CMS business of buyer of the assessee (buyer). Thus the payment made

by the assessee is for getting a vested right, which can be enforced under law

and without that other business man could compete with the assessee. The

learned Authorised Representative has submitted that the payment of non-
',                                          5', 
',                                                        ITA Nos.1469 to 1471/Bang/2014

compete is for acquiring a number of rights such as restricting the seller directly

or indirectly participating in the business similar to the assessee as acquired or

directly or indirectly soliciting the claim or customers of the existing business.

Thus the learned Authorised Representative has submitted that the payment

has been made for acquiring a commercial / business right is a valuable right.

The learned Authorised Representative has also referred the notes to accounts

and submitted that the contract manufacturing service division has been

purchased as a going concern and it was transferred to the assessee for a

purchase consideration of Rs.42.33 Crores. Thereafter the company engaged

external consultants to undertake fair valuation of fixed asset and intangibles

taken over from TVS Electronics Limited. Accordingly, as per the consultant,

the purchase price has been allocated to various assets including intangibles.

As per the share valuation a sum of Rs.6.7491 Crores has been allocated to

customer relationship right and a sum of Rs.2.55 Crores has been allocated to

goodwill. The learned Authorised Representative has pointed out that since it

was lumpsum sale for transfer of on going concern therefore no value was

assigned to the specific assets in the agreement but the purchase consideration

was agreed between parties on lumpsum basis. The learned A.R. has contended
',                                         6', u"
                                                     ITA Nos.1469 to 1471/Bang/2014

that the CIT (Appeals) has relied upon the decision of Hon'ble Delhi High Court

in the Sharp Business System (supra) whereas the jurisdictional High Court in

the subsequent judgment in the case of CIT Vs. Ingersoll Rand International

India Ltd. 48 taxmann.com 349 (Kar) has decided this issue of depreciation on

non-compete fees in favour of the assessee.           He learned Authorised

Representative has pointed out that Hon'ble High Court after considering the

judgment of Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of Sharp Business System

(supra) has decided this issue. Therefore, in view of the judgment of Hon'ble

jurisdictional High Court, the issue is now covered in favour of the assessee.

He has also relied upon the judgment of Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of

Areva T & D India Ltd. V DCIT (2012) 345 ITR 421 and submitted that in an

identical case there was a lump sum sale, the Hon'ble Delhi High Court has held

that the intangible assets in the nature of business information, business

record, contract, employees and know-how fall in the genus of intangible

assets that form part of the tool of trade of assessee facilitating smooth

carrying on the business and therefore eligible for depreciation under ", Section

31(1)(ii)',  of the Act.
',                                          7', 
',                                                        ITA Nos.1469 to 1471/Bang/2014

', u"5.        On the other hand, the learned Departmental Representative has

submitted that neither anything mentioned in the BTA nor in the arrangement

between parties which can indicate that there was any transfer of intangible

asset in the transaction of contract manufacture service division of TVS

Electronics Ltd.. Further, the term 'customer relationship right' does not find

place in ", Section 32(1)(ii)', u" and this term also not similar to the terms of know

how, patent, copy right, trade mark, business or franchise. Therefore, in view

of the judgment of Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of Sharp Business

System (supra), the payments made by the assessee on account of business

relationship right or non-compete fees is not eligible for depreciation.

", 6.     We have heard the rival submissions as well as considered the relevant

material on record. The transaction of purchase of contract manufacturing

service division of TVS Electronics Ltd. by the assessee vide BTA dt.31.5.2007 is

slump sale as the consideration was agreed and paid in lump sum without

assigning any value to specific assets. Therefore as per the agreement the

consideration was paid lump sum without giving any details of payment for any

specific assets.   The business was purchased by the assessee and it was

transferred by the TVS Electronics as an on going business/division. However,
',                                         8', 
                                                     ITA Nos.1469 to 1471/Bang/2014

in its books of accounts the assessee has valued the fixed asset and intangibles

as per the valuation made by the consultants as under :
', 
',                                                      (in Rs. Million)
           Land                                      29.013
           Building                                  15.286
           Plant and Machinery                       39.230
           Other Fixed Assets                        14.076
           Inventory
',               - Raw material                         92.062
',               - Finished and semi-finished goods     23.368
           Debtors                                   97.793
           Loans and Advances                        45.410
           Total Assets                              356.238
           Current Liabilities and Proivsions        79.571
           Net Assets taken over                     276.667
           Advance for building                      53.614
           Customer Relationships                    67.491
           Goodwill                                  25.563
           Total value of assets taken over (Net)    423.335


Thus it is clear that the excess amount paid by the assessee over and above the

value assigned to the various assets had been assigned to two intangibles

namely "customer relationship" and "goodwill". The assessee did not claim any

depreciation on the value of Rs.2.55 Crores assigned to the goodwill and

therefore the same was not an issue before the authorities below.             The

assessee claimed depreciation in respect of the amount of Rs.6.74 Crores which
',                                        9', 
                                                    ITA Nos.1469 to 1471/Bang/2014

was assigned to customer relationship (intangible). The assessee took a plea

that this amount was paid as non-compete fees as the seller has expressed,

agreed and undertook not to participate or engage in any jurisdiction as a

owner or partner or as shareholder or in any capacity in the business of

contract manufacturing services which was transferred to the assessee. Thus

the learned Authorised Representative has referred to the ', Article 11',  of BTA in

support of his contention that the payment was made for non-compete fees.
', 
', However, in the absence of any agreement between the parties for any

consideration on account of non-compete fees as well as in the absence of any

such value assigned to the non-compete fees in the books of accounts, we do

not find any substance in the contention of the learned Authorised

Representative that the said payment is made as non-compete fees. The

assessee in its books of accounts has allocated sum to the intangible being

customer relationship. Therefore, though the seller has agreed not to engage

in any business for a period of three years or participate or engage as owner,

partner shareholder, consultant, advisor or any other capacity solicit the

employees of the CMS Business however in the absence of any intention of

parties to pay consideration for such restrictive covenants in the agreement
',                                         10', u"
                                                      ITA Nos.1469 to 1471/Bang/2014

the payment in question cannot be regarded as non-compete fees. Therefore,

the decision of the Hon'ble jurisdictional High Court in the case of Ingersoll

Rand International India Ltd. (supra) will not help the case of the assessee. As

regards the nature of payment in question, as treated by the assessee in the

books of accounts being customer relationship, the issue is clearly decided

against the assessee by the decision of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case

of Sharp Business System (supra). However, this can be looked from another

angle because the Assessing Officer while denying the claim of depreciation has

taken a view that the customer relationship rights are in the nature of goodwill

as under :
", 
', "The submissions made by company are considered. The assessee has relied
upon ', section 32(1)(ii)',  of the Income Tax Act, stating that the wordings äny other
business or commercial rights of similar nature" gives scope to many such
business or commercial rights including customer relationship rights which are
as per assessee almost in nature of goodwill. Hence there is no dispute that
customer relationship rights are in nature of goodwill."

Therefore the claim of the assessee is required to be considered by treating the

said payment as goodwill.     The learned Authorised Representative of the

assessee has relied upon the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of

CIT Vs. Smsifs Securities Ltd. 348 ITR 302 and submitted that in view of the said
',                                               11', u"
                                                               ITA Nos.1469 to 1471/Bang/2014

judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, goodwill eligible for depreciation as

per the ", Section 31(1)(ii)',  of the Act.             Since the assessee did not claim

depreciation on goodwill in the return of income and even not made any claim

before the CIT (Appeals). Therefore, the issue of allowing depreciation on

goodwill has not been examined by the authorities below.

', 7.    The assessee has also raised additional ground in respect of depreciation

on goodwill as under :
', 
', " The learned CIT(A) has failed to appreciate that the customer relationship rights
(non-compete fees) are akin to any other business or commercial rights and therefore eligible
for depreciation under the provisions of ', Section 32(1)(ii)', u" of the Act.

Additional Ground of Appeal No 1

Without prejudice to the Appellant's contention that depreciation should be allowed on the
non-compete fees, the learned Assessing Officer / Commissioner of Income-tax (Appeals)
have erred in law and facts in not allowing the non-compete fees paid by the Appellant as
revenue expenditure since the same has been incurred wholly and exclusively for the
purpose of the business.
", 
', Additional Ground of Appeal No 2

The learned Assessing Officer has erred in law, and in facts, in not allowing depreciation on
goodwill      as    per     ', Section     32(1)(ii)',    of     the     Act,     amounting       to
Rs.5,992,765 i.e 25% of the written down value of the total goodwill amounting to
Rs 31,961,412, which arose on account of acquisition of the Contract Manufacturing Services
division of TVS Electronics Limited under a slump sale arrangement by executing a Business
Transfer Agreement."
', 
', u"8.     We have heard the rival submissions as well as considered the relevant

material on record. The issue of 'depreciation' on goodwill is a legal issue and

does not require any further investigation of fact as the Assessing Officer has
",                                           12', 
                                                        ITA Nos.1469 to 1471/Bang/2014

not disputed or disturbed the valuation allocated/assigned by the assessee in

the books of accounts to the fixed assets and intangibles including goodwill.

Therefore in the facts and circumstances of the case and in the interest of
