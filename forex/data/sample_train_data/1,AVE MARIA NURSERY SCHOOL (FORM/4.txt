', Loans', 
', Few students can afford to pay for law school without some form of educational loan. Scholarships, work-study and other forms of aid typically do not cover the cost of a law school education. Many students find they must supplement their savings and scholarship assistance with educational loans. Ave Maria School of Law participates in the Federal Direct Loan Program which includes the Federal Direct Stafford Loan and the Federal Direct Grad PLUS Loan.', 
', General Loan Information', 
', 
', Loans must be repaid.', 
', Always borrow conservatively. Develop a budget on which you can live reasonably and frugally. Make sacrifices to avoid all unnecessary expenditures. Remember, you will only be in law school for a short time. Sacrifice now while you are a student, so you do not have to when you are no longer a student.', 
', Generally, you will repay $3 for every $1 that you borrow. Only borrow what is absolutely necessary.', 
', Keep copies of all loan forms you have signed and all correspondence from your lender.',
