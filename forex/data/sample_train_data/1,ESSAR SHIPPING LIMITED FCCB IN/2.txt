		', Speaking to CNBC-TV18, Lalit Kumar Gupta, chief   executive officer, Essar Oil, says the FCCBs will be converted at an average   price of Rs 130 and Rs 153 in two different tranches.', 
  Lalit Kumar Gupta,   chief executive officer, Essar Oil says the company\u2019s promoters are converting   the Foreign Currency Convertible Bond (FCCB) in order to boost the company\u2019s   networth. Additionally, Gupta says that the company has high interest costs of   Rs 3000 crore per annum, but it is likely to be reduced substantially by USD   150-200 million (Rs 15-20 crore).', 
  Below is the edited transcript of   Gupta\u2019s interview to CNBC-TV18. ', Q: Take us through the   Foreign Currency Convertible Bond (FCCB) conversion because it\u2019s a large amount   USD 260 million and the promoters will be converting these FCCBs at three times   the market price or 2.5 times the market   price?', A:',  Last year our   promoter company had decided to convert optionally convertible debenture into   compulsory convertible debenture in order to make sure that our networth is   improving. Now they have decided to convert compulsory convertible debenture   into equity and accordingly, they have given us notice. They are converting   almost at an average price of Rs 130 and Rs 153 in two different tranches. So,   USD 260 million will now get converted into equity and will definitely boost our   networth.', Q: What are the pending FCCBs that Essar Oil has   and what are the timelines of conversion and who would they be issued to. Would   it only be the promoter company?', A: ', USD 260 million which is getting converted for which we have   received a notice from our parent company, Essar Energy Plc, is getting   converted immediately and thereafter we do not have any other remaining FCCB for   conversion.', Q: The thing that stood out from your numbers   last time was the below EBITDA numbers. You had interest cost on one side, which   are decent but you have forex element, which is still impacting your numbers.   How would both of these numbers pan out as you go   forward?', A:',  We have   clarified earlier in great detail that the foreign exchange variations which we   show in our accounts, they are mark to market (MTM) provisions which get   realised in the next quarter so they generally are to be seen in the context   that they are accounting policies and not necessarily the losses.', 
		',   Yes, there   is interest of about Rs 3,000 crore plus as of now. About 100 percent of our   revenues and expenditures are in dollars and so our earnings are also in   dollars. Our natural currency is dollar so we are converting this which will   substantially reduce interest by USD 150-200 million. Therefore, going forward   we expect that interest burden should come down. In Q2 interest started showing   some declining trend because of this conversion. ', 
		',   We have set up Essar Oil   totally at USD 5 billion and today our debt including even sales tax is about   USD 3.5 billion. So, if one sees it in context it is absolutely in control and   once we convert interest expense into dollar loans, it is going to be within the   limit.', Q: How much it could reduce in   FY15?', A:',  Our present target   is to convert about USD 2 billion into foreign currency and if we take saving of   6 percent, at least USD 120 million interest amount should go down   further.', Q: Your gross refinery margins (GRMs) were also   positively surprised the market in Q2. What has been the trend in Q3 so   far?', A:',  Q2 was a monsoon   quarter in India and this time we had robust and good monsoon so India exported   lot of diesel, which also helped in depressing the market in Q2. Although Q3   began with a slightly depressed note but now we are finding that margins are   coming up and the quarter is now looking good.', 
  On December 06, 2013, at   14:15 hrs Essar Oil was quoting at Rs 55.25, up Rs 0.45, or 0.82 percent. The   52-week high of the share was Rs 96.15 and the 52-week low was Rs   46.05.', 
  The latest book value of the company is Rs 8.01 per share. At   current value, the price-to-book value of the company was 6.90.',

		', Speaking to CNBC-TV18, Lalit Kumar Gupta, chief   executive officer, Essar Oil, says the FCCBs will be converted at an average   price of Rs 130 and Rs 153 in two different tranches.', 
  Lalit Kumar Gupta,   chief executive officer, Essar Oil says the company\u2019s promoters are converting   the Foreign Currency Convertible Bond (FCCB) in order to boost the company\u2019s   networth. Additionally, Gupta says that the company has high interest costs of   Rs 3000 crore per annum, but it is likely to be reduced substantially by USD   150-200 million (Rs 15-20 crore).', 
  Below is the edited transcript of   Gupta\u2019s interview to CNBC-TV18. ', Q: Take us through the   Foreign Currency Convertible Bond (FCCB) conversion because it\u2019s a large amount   USD 260 million and the promoters will be converting these FCCBs at three times   the market price or 2.5 times the market   price?', A:',  Last year our   promoter company had decided to convert optionally convertible debenture into   compulsory convertible debenture in order to make sure that our networth is   improving. Now they have decided to convert compulsory convertible debenture   into equity and accordingly, they have given us notice. They are converting   almost at an average price of Rs 130 and Rs 153 in two different tranches. So,   USD 260 million will now get converted into equity and will definitely boost our   networth.', Q: What are the pending FCCBs that Essar Oil has   and what are the timelines of conversion and who would they be issued to. Would   it only be the promoter company?', A: ', USD 260 million which is getting converted for which we have   received a notice from our parent company, Essar Energy Plc, is getting   converted immediately and thereafter we do not have any other remaining FCCB for   conversion.', Q: The thing that stood out from your numbers   last time was the below EBITDA numbers. You had interest cost on one side, which   are decent but you have forex element, which is still impacting your numbers.   How would both of these numbers pan out as you go   forward?', A:',  We have   clarified earlier in great detail that the foreign exchange variations which we   show in our accounts, they are mark to market (MTM) provisions which get   realised in the next quarter so they generally are to be seen in the context   that they are accounting policies and not necessarily the losses.', 
		',   Yes, there   is interest of about Rs 3,000 crore plus as of now. About 100 percent of our   revenues and expenditures are in dollars and so our earnings are also in   dollars. Our natural currency is dollar so we are converting this which will   substantially reduce interest by USD 150-200 million. Therefore, going forward   we expect that interest burden should come down. In Q2 interest started showing   some declining trend because of this conversion. ', 
		',   We have set up Essar Oil   totally at USD 5 billion and today our debt including even sales tax is about   USD 3.5 billion. So, if one sees it in context it is absolutely in control and   once we convert interest expense into dollar loans, it is going to be within the   limit.', Q: How much it could reduce in   FY15?', A:',  Our present target   is to convert about USD 2 billion into foreign currency and if we take saving of   6 percent, at least USD 120 million interest amount should go down   further.', Q: Your gross refinery margins (GRMs) were also   positively surprised the market in Q2. What has been the trend in Q3 so   far?', A:',  Q2 was a monsoon   quarter in India and this time we had robust and good monsoon so India exported   lot of diesel, which also helped in depressing the market in Q2. Although Q3   began with a slightly depressed note but now we are finding that margins are   coming up and the quarter is now looking good.', 
  On December 06, 2013, at   14:15 hrs Essar Oil was quoting at Rs 55.25, up Rs 0.45, or 0.82 percent. The   52-week high of the share was Rs 96.15 and the 52-week low was Rs   46.05.', 
  The latest book value of the company is Rs 8.01 per share. At   current value, the price-to-book value of the company was 6.90.',
