', Canadian International School', 
', 
   ', CIS Profile  2017', 
   ', 
   The Canadian International School (CIS) is a leading international school in Singapore. Founded in 1990, CIS has over 3,000 students from more than 70 nationalities enrolled across two campuses - Lakeside in the west (for students aged 3 to 18 years) and Tanjong Katong in the east (for students aged 3 to 12 years).', 

  ', A Global Curriculum', 

  CIS is one of the few international schools in Singapore to offer all three International Baccalaureate programmes, from Primary Years through to the Diploma Programme. The CIS curriculum is benchmarked against national curricula globally, allowing students to successfully transition to any other school if and when required, or to graduate and be admitted to leading universities anywhere in the world. To date, over 180 universities globally have offered places to CIS graduates.', 

', A Student-Centric Approach', 
', 
  CIS has a culture of innovation, in academic programming and thinking. Faculty adopt a student-centric approach which ensures that programme development, curriculum and assessment are driven by what is best for children and their learning, across the K-12 spectrum. This student-centricity manifests itself in pioneering programmes and learning spaces that simulate the real world, provoke inquiry and investigation, analysis and experimentation, collaboration and communication, and innovation and creativity.', 
  
  ', Making Connections', 
  At CIS, students are taught how to think, not what to think. Learning isn\u2019t deskbound. Students are taught to become flexible and critical thinkers, creative in the way that they connect ideas and concepts, collaborative in their thinking and inspirational in their capacity to motivate others. They collaborate, they connect with the community and environment around them, and they search for solutions rather than look for the one \u2018right\u2019 answer. They are encouraged to build on their natural curiosity and develop strong communication skills that will enable them to connect with people both on a local and global level.', 
  
  
  ', Instilling a Determination to Act and Achieve', 
  ', 
  CIS teaches students the value of resilience, giving them the confidence to pursue an idea from inception to completion, as well as providing them with the necessary skills to overcome the barriers they may encounter along the way. At CIS, students are instilled with a sense of drive, purpose and a determination to achieve.', 
  
  ', 21st Century Success', 
  Today\u2019s students are in a unique position; they are the first generation to face a world where exam results alone no longer dictate success. Success in a global environment more than ever before will require not only the ability to come up with fresh and original ideas, but the focus and dedication to turn those ideas into action.', 
  
  
   ', A STEAM Philosophy that fuels innovation', 
   ', 
  The CIS STEAM (Science, Technology, Entrepreneurship, Arts and Mathematics) philosophy and makerspaces provide project based learning experiences that challenge inquisitive minds, fuel innovative thinking, and create a culture of teamwork and collaboration. STEAM provides students with:
  
 
', 
', An ', engaging',  interdisciplinary approach that integrates the five areas of ', science, technology, entrepreneurship, arts and mathematics', .', 
', Innovative and ', enlightening',  learning experiences that are transformational, for both students and educators.', 
', An inquiry-based approach that helps develop critical thinking skills and creativity, spurring innovation and invention. Students are ', empowered',  to take control of their own learning, preparing them to be problem solvers in the real world.
', 
', 
   
  
    ', Bilingual Chinese-English Programme', 
	', 
 CIS offers a pioneering bilingual programme in Chinese and English to students aged 4 to 7. Key features of this programme include:
  
  ', 
', A bilingual curriculum fully aligned to the IB Primary Years Programme, promoting intercultural understanding and inquiry based learning.', 
', Two fully qualified teachers per class - one native Chinese speaker and one native English speaker.', 
', Equal exposure to both languages.
', 
  ', 
  

  
', Campuses', 
  CIS has two campuses on the island, Lakeside in the west, and Tanjong Katong in the east. Both campuses are conveniently located near public transport and are a short drive from most expat communities - both in the centre of Singapore and in the East Coast area.',

', Canadian International School', 
', 
   ', CIS Profile  2017', 
   ', 
   The Canadian International School (CIS) is a leading international school in Singapore. Founded in 1990, CIS has over 3,000 students from more than 70 nationalities enrolled across two campuses - Lakeside in the west (for students aged 3 to 18 years) and Tanjong Katong in the east (for students aged 3 to 12 years).', 

  ', A Global Curriculum', 

  CIS is one of the few international schools in Singapore to offer all three International Baccalaureate programmes, from Primary Years through to the Diploma Programme. The CIS curriculum is benchmarked against national curricula globally, allowing students to successfully transition to any other school if and when required, or to graduate and be admitted to leading universities anywhere in the world. To date, over 180 universities globally have offered places to CIS graduates.', 

', A Student-Centric Approach', 
', 
  CIS has a culture of innovation, in academic programming and thinking. Faculty adopt a student-centric approach which ensures that programme development, curriculum and assessment are driven by what is best for children and their learning, across the K-12 spectrum. This student-centricity manifests itself in pioneering programmes and learning spaces that simulate the real world, provoke inquiry and investigation, analysis and experimentation, collaboration and communication, and innovation and creativity.', 
  
  ', Making Connections', 
  At CIS, students are taught how to think, not what to think. Learning isn\u2019t deskbound. Students are taught to become flexible and critical thinkers, creative in the way that they connect ideas and concepts, collaborative in their thinking and inspirational in their capacity to motivate others. They collaborate, they connect with the community and environment around them, and they search for solutions rather than look for the one \u2018right\u2019 answer. They are encouraged to build on their natural curiosity and develop strong communication skills that will enable them to connect with people both on a local and global level.', 
  
  
  ', Instilling a Determination to Act and Achieve', 
  ', 
  CIS teaches students the value of resilience, giving them the confidence to pursue an idea from inception to completion, as well as providing them with the necessary skills to overcome the barriers they may encounter along the way. At CIS, students are instilled with a sense of drive, purpose and a determination to achieve.', 
  
  ', 21st Century Success', 
  Today\u2019s students are in a unique position; they are the first generation to face a world where exam results alone no longer dictate success. Success in a global environment more than ever before will require not only the ability to come up with fresh and original ideas, but the focus and dedication to turn those ideas into action.', 
  
  
   ', A STEAM Philosophy that fuels innovation', 
   ', 
  The CIS STEAM (Science, Technology, Entrepreneurship, Arts and Mathematics) philosophy and makerspaces provide project based learning experiences that challenge inquisitive minds, fuel innovative thinking, and create a culture of teamwork and collaboration. STEAM provides students with:
  
 
', 
', An ', engaging',  interdisciplinary approach that integrates the five areas of ', science, technology, entrepreneurship, arts and mathematics', .', 
', Innovative and ', enlightening',  learning experiences that are transformational, for both students and educators.', 
', An inquiry-based approach that helps develop critical thinking skills and creativity, spurring innovation and invention. Students are ', empowered',  to take control of their own learning, preparing them to be problem solvers in the real world.
', 
', 
   
  
    ', Bilingual Chinese-English Programme', 
	', 
 CIS offers a pioneering bilingual programme in Chinese and English to students aged 4 to 7. Key features of this programme include:
  
  ', 
', A bilingual curriculum fully aligned to the IB Primary Years Programme, promoting intercultural understanding and inquiry based learning.', 
', Two fully qualified teachers per class - one native Chinese speaker and one native English speaker.', 
', Equal exposure to both languages.
', 
  ', 
  

  
', Campuses', 
  CIS has two campuses on the island, Lakeside in the west, and Tanjong Katong in the east. Both campuses are conveniently located near public transport and are a short drive from most expat communities - both in the centre of Singapore and in the East Coast area.',
