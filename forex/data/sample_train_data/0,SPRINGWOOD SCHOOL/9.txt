From creating bonds with classmates, winning state championships, or just sitting in a classroom learning something new, Springwood has prepared me for not only college but for the rest of my life. I feel like I'm more of man because of my experiences at Springwood, and truly believe I could tackle just about anything life throws my way. And this is all because of the great resources, facilities, and teachers that Springwood provides. I can not say it enough, if you want your child to become a great student and great adult, Springwood will do just that. There is a perfect relationship between discipline and freedom that the safety of Springwood allows for the students. A child will graduate Springwood ready for higher learning and life.", Senior', 7 days ago', Review Your ', School', Report', The teachers at this school are overall very interested in the improvement of every individual student. They take the time to understand each student's academics and hobbies.on a personal level. As an alumni of Springwood School, my time here has been worthwhile in preparing me for college level academics. I would say Springwood's level of academics is comparable to college academics; thus, the transition between high school and college has felt easy and in no way stressful. Using some of the most recent technology, teachers are able to provide examples and many visual aids to help students learn. Nearly every classroom has a "smartboard" that teachers can use to show powerpoints, current news videos, show steps in completing algebra, or provide aid in giving a classroom lecture. I value my education from Springwood and the one thing I value the most is the personal connection a student establishes with the teachers at Springwood School. Its interesting and inspiring to learn from the many personal experiences that Springwood teachers have to tell their students. It makes the student feel special to hear about where their teachers have come from and what shaped them into the person they are today. I would recommend this school to anyone seeking a quality college preparatory education.', Niche User', 10 months ago', Report', This school has a good health program. They have a health class that educates students on the importance of physical activity, developing good eating habits, and making sure they make good decisions about their health in the future. However, the absence of a school nurse is an issue. If a student gets sick in class, he/she has to be transported off campus in order to receive medical treatment. If its a minor health problem such as a cut, scraped knee, or headache then the central office is equipped with enough first aid experience to handle the problem sufficiently.', Niche User', 10 months ago', Read More Reviews', Add to List', About Us', Advertising', Blog', Contact Niche', Login', Register', Data', Jobs', Licensing', Press', Privacy Policy', Terms of Use', Facebook', Twitter', Google+', ©', 2017',  Niche.com Inc.', Discover the schools and neighborhoods that are right for you.', Places to Live', Search Places to Live', Rankings', Review Your Area', K-12', School Search', School Rankings', Review Your School', Colleges', College Search', College Rankings', Review Your College', Scholarships', $2,000 No Essay Scholarship', Do you work for a school or college?

I feel like I'm more of man because of my experiences at Springwood, and truly believe I could tackle just about anything life throws my way. And this is all because of the great resources, facilities, and teachers that Springwood provides. I can not say it enough, if you want your child to become a great student and great adult, Springwood will do just that. There is a perfect relationship between discipline and freedom that the safety of Springwood allows for the students.

They take the time to understand each student's academics and hobbies.on a personal level. As an alumni of Springwood School, my time here has been worthwhile in preparing me for college level academics. I would say Springwood's level of academics is comparable to college academics; thus, the transition between high school and college has felt easy and in no way stressful. Using some of the most recent technology, teachers are able to provide examples and many visual aids to help students learn. Nearly every classroom has a \"smartboard\" that teachers can use to show powerpoints, current news videos, show steps in completing algebra, or provide aid in giving a classroom lecture. I value my education from Springwood and the one thing I value the most is the personal connection a student establishes with the teachers at Springwood School. Its interesting and inspiring to learn from the many personal experiences that Springwood teachers have to tell their students. It makes the student feel special to hear about where their teachers have come from and what shaped them into the person they are today. I would recommend this school to anyone seeking a quality college preparatory education.","rating":5,"author":"Niche User","created":"2016-02-28T18:42:57Z"},{"guid":"81c78fc0-8e42-4009-854b-638f34b4f2db","body":"This school has a good health program.

From creating bonds with classmates, winning state championships, or just sitting in a classroom learning something new, Springwood has prepared me for not only college but for the rest of my life. I feel like I'm more of man because of my experiences at Springwood, and truly believe I could tackle just about anything life throws my way. And this is all because of the great resources, facilities, and teachers that Springwood provides. I can not say it enough, if you want your child to become a great student and great adult, Springwood will do just that. There is a perfect relationship between discipline and freedom that the safety of Springwood allows for the students. A child will graduate Springwood ready for higher learning and life.", Senior', 7 days ago', Review Your ', School', Report', The teachers at this school are overall very interested in the improvement of every individual student. They take the time to understand each student's academics and hobbies.on a personal level. As an alumni of Springwood School, my time here has been worthwhile in preparing me for college level academics. I would say Springwood's level of academics is comparable to college academics; thus, the transition between high school and college has felt easy and in no way stressful. Using some of the most recent technology, teachers are able to provide examples and many visual aids to help students learn. Nearly every classroom has a "smartboard" that teachers can use to show powerpoints, current news videos, show steps in completing algebra, or provide aid in giving a classroom lecture. I value my education from Springwood and the one thing I value the most is the personal connection a student establishes with the teachers at Springwood School. Its interesting and inspiring to learn from the many personal experiences that Springwood teachers have to tell their students. It makes the student feel special to hear about where their teachers have come from and what shaped them into the person they are today. I would recommend this school to anyone seeking a quality college preparatory education.', Niche User', 10 months ago', Report', This school has a good health program. They have a health class that educates students on the importance of physical activity, developing good eating habits, and making sure they make good decisions about their health in the future. However, the absence of a school nurse is an issue. If a student gets sick in class, he/she has to be transported off campus in order to receive medical treatment. If its a minor health problem such as a cut, scraped knee, or headache then the central office is equipped with enough first aid experience to handle the problem sufficiently.', Niche User', 10 months ago', Read More Reviews', Add to List', About Us', Advertising', Blog', Contact Niche', Login', Register', Data', Jobs', Licensing', Press', Privacy Policy', Terms of Use', Facebook', Twitter', Google+', ©', 2017',  Niche.com Inc.', Discover the schools and neighborhoods that are right for you.', Places to Live', Search Places to Live', Rankings', Review Your Area', K-12', School Search', School Rankings', Review Your School', Colleges', College Search', College Rankings', Review Your College', Scholarships', $2,000 No Essay Scholarship', Do you work for a school or college?

From creating bonds with classmates, winning state championships, or just sitting in a classroom learning something new, Springwood has prepared me for not only college but for the rest of my life. I feel like I'm more of man because of my experiences at Springwood, and truly believe I could tackle just about anything life throws my way. And this is all because of the great resources, facilities, and teachers that Springwood provides. I can not say it enough, if you want your child to become a great student and great adult, Springwood will do just that. There is a perfect relationship between discipline and freedom that the safety of Springwood allows for the students. A child will graduate Springwood ready for higher learning and life.","rating":5,"author":"Senior","created":"2016-12-29T20:18:26.950055Z"},{"guid":"78972ce2-8d12-43bc-8e2f-96e29d962bec","body":"The teachers at this school are overall very interested in the improvement of every individual student. They take the time to understand each student's academics and hobbies.on a personal level. As an alumni of Springwood School, my time here has been worthwhile in preparing me for college level academics. I would say Springwood's level of academics is comparable to college academics; thus, the transition between high school and college has felt easy and in no way stressful. Using some of the most recent technology, teachers are able to provide examples and many visual aids to help students learn. Nearly every classroom has a \"smartboard\" that teachers can use to show powerpoints, current news videos, show steps in completing algebra, or provide aid in giving a classroom lecture. I value my education from Springwood and the one thing I value the most is the personal connection a student establishes with the teachers at Springwood School. Its interesting and inspiring to learn from the many personal experiences that Springwood teachers have to tell their students. It makes the student feel special to hear about where their teachers have come from and what shaped them into the person they are today. I would recommend this school to anyone seeking a quality college preparatory education.","rating":5,"author":"Niche User","created":"2016-02-28T18:42:57Z"},{"guid":"81c78fc0-8e42-4009-854b-638f34b4f2db","body":"This school has a good health program.

If its a minor health problem such as a cut, scraped knee, or headache then the central office is equipped with enough first aid experience to handle the problem sufficiently.","rating":3,"author":"Niche User","created":"2016-02-28T22:21:58Z"}]}]},"4":{"template":"Blank","config":{},"contents":[{"template":"ExpansionLink","config":{"link_text":["Read More Reviews"],"page_name":["reviews"]},"type":"ExpansionLink","expandable":true}]}}},{"template":"BlockTemplateBlank","config":{},"buckets":{"1":{"template":"Blank","config":{},"contents":[{"template":"AddtoList","config":{"event_action":["Add_to_List"],"event_category":["Revenue"],"event_label":["${ENTITY_GUID}_end-page"],"hierarchy":["One"]},"type":"CTA"}]}}}],"entity_data":{"name":"Springwood School","guid":"0e3dbf56-94f8-494a-b69d-e6999d43db2b","entity_type":"School","is_published":"true","is_displayable":"true","url_fragment":"springwood-school-lanett-al","tagline_fact_1":"Private School","tagline_fact_2":"Lanett, AL","tagline_fact_3":"K-12","parent_guid":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","state_guid":"bcace3a7-dc8b-437b-a107-4499869a449a","metro_guid":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","geo_parent_guid":"8e1ff072-fd3d-4536-9311-4fae36dbc2cd"},"children":{"d4afc202-a90c-4cb9-9c9f-f7d0e9db2743":{"entityGuid":"d4afc202-a90c-4cb9-9c9f-f7d0e9db2743","entityName":"Auburn University","entityType":"College","entityTypeCode":"u","tagline":"4 Year &middot;
