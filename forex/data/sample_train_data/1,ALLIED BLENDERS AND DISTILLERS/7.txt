', In 1988 Kishore Chhabria, the future founder of Allied Blenders & Distilleries (ABD), was then managing director of the ', Shaw Wallace', , an Indian liquor manufacturer based in ', Kolkata',  owned by his elder brother, Manu Chhabria. Kishore Chhabria noticed that all attention had been given to frontline brands and some brands had been ignored by the administration of the company. To boost neglected brands, he set up a separate division of the company in ', Delhi',  and created a new whisky which he intended to have affordability with class.', [2]', [3]', 
', Dispute over ownership', [', edit', ]', 
', Kishore Chhabria had a long dispute with ', Vijay Mallya',  of ', United Spirits',  over ownership of the Officer's Choice brand. In 1990s Kishore Chhabria fell out with his brother Manu Chhabria and left Shaw Wallace, taking "Officer's Choice" with him. Later he joined Vijay Mallya who gave Kishore equal stakes of his company, Herbertson. At that time OC became a product of Herbertson. Later Kishore also fell out with Mallya, and left Herbertson taking a single brand, "Officer's Choice" with him. He established his own company, Allied Blenders & Distilleries (ABD), and OC became its prime brand. However, Mallya bought Shaw Wallace after the death of Manu Chhabria. Mallya also claimed that "Officer's Choice" was the product of his company. Finally, this dispute was resolved out of court with Kishore paying ', \u20b9', 8 crore',  (US$1.2 million) to Mallya.', [4]', [5]', [6]', [7]', [8]',
