'Superdeep' diamonds originate from a depth range spanning the
asthenospheric upper mantle, transition zone and shallowest parts of the
lower mantle [1]. Sporadically they entrap small inclusions of
pre-existing or co-precipitating minerals during their crystallisation
from volatile-rich melts or fluids. Such samples therefore preserve
important petrologic, tectonic and geodynamic information about their
growth environment together with evidence of the deep volatile cycling.
The Juina-5 kimberlite has previously been recognised as a source of
'superdeep' diamonds [2]. Here we present and discuss data from an
extended collection of Juina-5 diamonds. This work has revealed that
these diamonds are dominantly composed of isotopically light carbon and
contain a mineral inclusion cargo mostly of eclogitic affinity
consisting of many former Mg- and Ca-perovskite, NAL-phase, CF-phase,
stishovite, majoritic garnet, sodic pyroxene, ferropericlase, Fe or
Fe-carbide and sulphide minerals. Together these observations suggest
that the diamonds form from material of a subducted crustal origin. The
high enrichment of the inclusions' trace element compositions implies
that they cannot represent trapped fragments of formerly subsolidus
mantle material. Geochemical modelling instead allows the compositions
of Ca-perovskite and majorite inclusions to be directly linked to
formation from a slab-derived carbonate bearing melt. It is suggested
that the formation of 'superdeep' diamonds, and their inclusions, is the
result of 'redox-freezing' during the interaction of oxidised slab melts
and reducing mantle rocks [3]. It is expected that such melts will be
produced during slab foundering and thermal equilibration in the
upper/lower mantle boundary region, where tomographic evidence suggests
slab subduction often stalls [4]. This hypothesis has been tested with
experiments performed at transition zone pressures using the multi-anvil
apparatus. At 20 GPa the composition of a low degree melt of carbonated
MORB is a Na-rich carbonatite. During the reaction of this comparatively
oxidised melt with a mantle peridotite assemblage, Ca(Si,Ti)O3
perovskite, majoritic garnet and Na-bearing ferropericlase were formed.
The compositions of these experimental phases are very similar to
diamond hosted inclusions, confirming that this type of 'redox-freezing'
interaction is a viable diamond formation mechanism. We conclude that
superdeep diamonds provide a direct snapshot of the Earth's deep carbon
cycle. [1] Harte, B., Mineralogical Magazine, 2010. 74: p. 189-215. [2]
