', Academic Support', In addition to offering Scholars free workshops on developing good study skills and providing access to the 21', st',  Century Scholars Academic Advisor, the IUB 21', st',  Century Scholars Office the IUB 21st Century Scholars Office provides free tutoring weekly in Eigenmann Hall 621 through the Academic Support Center in entry level math and science courses.  We can also connect you with tutors and workshops offered by other campus programs, such as our DEMA partner, the ', Academic Support Center', , as well as the ', Student Academic Center', . In addition, many academic departments on campus have their own tutoring programs and study tables. Please take a moment to review the websites and resources listed above. If you cannot find the support you are looking for, fill out our ', tutor request form', , and we will connect you with a tutoring referral.   If you experience a drop in your grade point average, we offer programming designed to promote academic recovery.', 
', Student Organizations', Student organizations are a great way to get involved on campus and in the community and connect to other students.  With 700+ student organizations on campus, chances are you can find several groups that share your passions and interests. A database of student organizations searchable by category or keywords can be found at ', myINvolvement.indiana.ed, .    Or you can simply start with a student organization overseen by the 21', st',  Century Scholars Program and the Office of Mentoring Services & Leadership Development!', 
', Volunteer Corps', Volunteer Corps is a student organization that connects students to volunteer opportunities related to their major and/or interest.  Originally created for and by 21', st',  Century Scholars, Volunteer Corps is now open to all undergraduate students attending the Bloomington campus of Indiana University. Volunteer Corps provides its members with an opportunity to explore career and personal interests and enrich their educational experience through volunteering.

', FASE Mentoring', Part of the Office of Mentoring Services and Leadership Development, the Faculty and Staff for Student Excellence (FASE) Mentoring Program connects Indiana University Freshmen with upperclassmen Peer Mentors. Once matched with a mentor, freshmen students\u2014or protégés\u2014will be able to schedule one-on-one meetings with their mentor to help guide them through their first critical year of college. In addition, protégés will have an opportunity to participate in FASE Mentoring events, including free etiquette dinners, bowling, and the homecoming pre-tailgate party.

', Overseas Study', Every year, the ', Indiana University Office of Overseas Study Offices',  coordinates hundreds of Overseas Study programs in dozens of countries and on every continent except Antarctica.   In addition, many of the schools and colleges within the university sponsor their own overseas study programs. ', Many Scholars do not realize that their 21', st',  Century Scholarship can be applied toward a variety of study abroad programs. In addition, the 21', st',  Century Scholars Covenant can also be used to pay for study abroad expenses. To learn more about financial aid eligibility for overseas study, please visit ', http://www.indiana.edu/~overseas/first/financial-aid', .', It is more expensive to study overseas than in Bloomington due to extra costs for passports, Visas, airfare, and other incidental expenses incurred while abroad.  Although the 21', st',  Century Scholarship and Covenant can be applied towards IU administered, co-sponsored and departmental programs, the award amounts will still be based on the standard cost of attendance at IU Bloomington and cannot be increased to meet the additional expense of study overseas. ', The Office of Student Financial Assistance (OSFA) will adjust financial aid budgets based on the estimated program costs established by the Office of Overseas Study so students can pursue additional scholarships, grants or loans to help pay for the additional costs. For more information on institutional and national grants and scholarships specifically earmarked for study abroad, ', click here', . ', Scholars who are interested in overseas study should make an appointment to see an adviser in the Office of Overseas Study or individual school or college if interested in a departmental overseas study program.  Once you have picked out a program that you want to apply to, it is important that you work closely with the ', Office of Student Financial Assistance',  to ensure that your 21', st',  Century Scholarship and Covenant (if you are eligible) will apply, and to calculate what your total financial aid package will be, so you can determine if you need to pursue other financial aid resources. ', The Office of the Vice President for Diversity, Equity, and Multicultural Affairs offers a scholarship for qualified 21st Century Scholars interested in study abroad.  Scholarship applications are reviewed by a scholarship committee within the ', Office of the Vice President for Diversity, Equity, and Multicultural Affairs (OVPDEMA)',  after the posted deadline. This scholarship is not intended to pay for an entire study abroad program, but rather to assist students in covering some of the costs associated with international study. ', http://www.indiana.edu/~dema/resources/study_abroad_scholarship.shtml',  ', 
', Student Advocacy', The IUB 21', st',  Century Scholars Office is an advocate for Scholars on campus. If a Scholar is having trouble with grades, financial aid, housing, or other issues related to his or her experience at IU, we can act as a liaison between the Scholar and the appropriate university department. If we cannot help, or if we do not know an answer, we will put the Scholar in touch with someone at the University who can.  It is important that you advocate for yourself first by contacting the appropriate campus office.
