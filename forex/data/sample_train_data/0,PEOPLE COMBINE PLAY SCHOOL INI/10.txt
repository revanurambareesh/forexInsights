',  ', ADHD Institute ',  October 26, 2015 ', Future directions in the neurobiological understanding of ADHD: the ENIGMA Consortium ', 
', Understanding of the neurobiological correlates of ADHD may be further enhanced through the work of the Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) Consortium, a collaborative network of researchers working together to analyse neuroimaging data from 70 institutions around the world.', 
', A recent report has published the latest findings and future directions of ENIGMA studies, of which some are specifically related to ADHD. ENIGMA studies have analysed data from over 12,826 subjects, with a unified goal to bring together researchers with genome-wide images and data to build a comprehensive understanding of the brain that no individual site could investigate alone.', 
', There are several ENIGMA disease working groups, who assess the impact of genetic variants on the brain and behaviour in specific diseases; one such group is currently being formed for ADHD, which will analyse data from >1500 children and adults with the disorder and >2000 controls. Although ENIGMA researchers acknowledge that these data are likely to be heterogeneous in terms of duration of illness, disease aetiology, medication history, demographics, exposure to neuroprotective substances and many other factors, they also suggest that this will provide the opportunity to assess which of these factors are likely to affect disease expression in the brain with a sample size of sufficient power.', 
', Eventually, ENIGMA researchers hope to conduct cross-disorder meta-analyses on representative datasets from a range of psychiatric disorders, including ADHD, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, autism, obsessive-compulsive disorder and addiction, to identify common and distinctive patterns of brain morphometry with potential implications for diagnostic criteria.', 
', Medical News Today',  July 2, 2015 ', Major Depression tied to smaller hippocampus', 
', The largest international study to compare brain volumes of people with major depression to those of healthy people finds the former tend to have a significantly smaller hippocampus.', 
', Major ', depression',  is a serious mood disorder that affects around 1 in 6 people during their lifetime.', 
', When it occurs, persistent feelings of sadness, frustration, loss or anger disrupt everyday life and can endure for weeks, months or even years.', 
', The hippocampus \u2013 whose name comes from the Ancient Greek word for \u201cseahorse\u201d because of its shape \u2013 is an area of the brain that, among other things, is associated with forming new memories.', 
', The ENIGMA study researchers, including a group from the Brain and Mind Research Institute (BMRI) at the University of Sidney in Australia, suggest their findings highlight a need to treat depression when it first occurs \u2013 especially in adolescents and young adults.', 
', For the global study \u2013 which brings together 15 data sets from Europe, the USA and Australia \u2013 the team analyzed magnetic resonance imaging (', MRI', ) brain scans of nearly 9,000 participants: 1,728 with major depression and 7,199 healthy individuals.', 
', They also had access to clinical records of the participants with depression.', 
', The researchers report their findings in the journal ', Molecular Psychiatry', .', 
', The study has two main findings. The first \u2013 which confirms earlier clinical work at the BMRI \u2013 is that people with major depression have a smaller hippocampus.', 
', The second finding is that the first finding is largely accounted for by people with recurrent depression \u2013 they represented 65% of the major depression participants.', 
', Recurrent depression is a form of major depression where the depressive episodes come back regularly, interspersed with periods of no depression.', 
', Another interesting finding is that people whose major depression started before they reached the age of 21 also had a smaller hippocampus. The researchers suggest this is consistent with the idea that many of these youngsters go on to have recurrent depression.', 
', However, participants who had not experienced more than one episode of major depression \u2013 34% of those with major depression \u2013 did not have a smaller hippocampus than the healthy subjects.', 
', Jim Lagopoulos, an associate professor at BMRI, says these findings reveal new information about our brain structures and the mechanisms that might underlie depression. He adds:', 
', \u201cDespite intensive research aimed at identifying brain structures linked to depression in recent decades, our understanding of what causes depression is still rudimentary.\u201d', 
', He says one reason we know so little about this is the lack of studies with sufficiently large numbers of participants. Another reason is the disease varies widely, as do the treatments, and there are also complex interactions between some of the clinical characteristics and brain structure.', 
', Co-author Ian Hickie, professor and co-director of BMRI, says the clinical implications of the findings are that we probably need to treat first episodes of depression effectively, \u201cparticularly in teenagers and young adults, to prevent the brain changes that accompany recurrent depression.\u201d', 
', He says there is also a clear need for studies that can track changes in hippocampus size over time in people with depression. Results from such studies would help to clarify the question of cause and effect, \u201cwhether hippocampal abnormalities result from prolonged duration of chronic ', stress', , or represent a vulnerability factor for depression, or both.\u201d', 
', Prof. Lagopoulos also suggests the study lends support to the \u201cneurotrophic hypothesis of depression,\u201d the idea that people with chronic depression have certain differences in brain biology \u2013 such as sustained higher levels of glucocorticoid \u2013 that shrink the brain.', 
', Meanwhile, ', Medical News Today',  recently learned about new research that suggests ', brain inflammation links chronic pain',  with depression. The study is the first to discover brain ', inflammation',  caused by chronic nerve pain can affect signaling in regions associated with mood and motivation.', 
', The Conversation',  June 30, 2015 Depression damages parts of the brain, research concludes', 
', Brain damage is caused by persistent depression rather than being a predisposing factor for it, researchers have finally concluded after decades of unconfirmed hypothesising.', 
', A study published in ', Molecular Psychiatry',  today has proved once and for all that recurrent depression shrinks the hippocampus \u2013 an area of the brain responsible for forming new memories \u2013 leading to a loss of emotional and behavioural function.', 
', Hippocampal shrinkage has long been linked to depression but previous studies haven\u2019t been conclusive. Small sample sizes, varying types of depression and treatment levels, as well as variance in methods for collecting and interpreting results, have together led to inconsistent and often conflicting findings.', 
', Now, with the help of what co-author Ian Hickie from the Brain and Mind Research Institute has called \u201ca new spirit of collaboration\u201d a global, cross-sectional analysis of brain scans of 9,000 people has conclusively linked brain damage to depression.', 
', \u201cI think this resolves for good the issue that persistent experiences of depression hurts the brain,\u201d said Professor Hickie.', 
', Hippocampal shrinkage was pronounced among those for whom depression started early (before the age of 21), as well as people who had recurrent episodes. Professor Hickie noted that it was this persistence that \u201cdoes the damage\u201d.', 
', \u201cThose who have only ever had one episode do not have a smaller hippocampus, so it\u2019s not a predisposing factor but a consequence of the illness state.\u201d', 
', \u201cIt puts the emphasis then on early identification of the more severe persistent or recurrent cases. Importantly, in early identification systems you have to stick with those in who it persists or is recurrent, because they\u2019re the ones who will be most harmed from a brain point of view.\u201d', 
', Researchers used magnetic resonance imaged (MRI) brain scans and clinical data from 1,728 people with major depression and 7,199 healthy individuals, combining 15 datasets from Europe, the USA and Australia.', 
', The samples were obtained from the ', ENIGMA group',  database \u2013 an international consortium investigating psychiatric disorders.', 
', Scientia Professor & Head of the School of Psychiatry at UNSW Philip Mitchell said the use of the consortium\u2019s ongoing sample collection was \u201cbecoming a very powerful way of looking at what\u2019s happening in brain function\u201d.', 
', \u201cThis study confirms \u2013 in a very large sample \u2013 a finding that\u2019s been reported on quite a few occasions. It\u2019s interesting that none of the other subcortical areas of the brain have come up as consistently, so it also confirms that the hippocampus is particularly vulnerable to depression.\u201d', 
', The hippocampus is part of the brain\u2019s limbic system, or what\u2019s otherwise known as its emotional centre. The system also contains the amygdala, another part of the brain shown to be affected by depression.', 
', While the hippocampus plays an important role in consolidating and forming new memories, Professor Hickie explained that \u201cmemories\u201d weren\u2019t just about remembering passwords.', 
', \u201cYour whole sense of self depends on continuously understanding who you are in the world \u2013 your state of memory is not about just knowing how to do Sudoku or remembering your password \u2013 it\u2019s the whole concept we hold of ourselves,\u201d he said.', 
', \u201cWe\u2019ve seen in a lot of other animal experiments that when you shrink the hippocampus, you don\u2019t just change memory, you change all sorts of other behaviours associated with that \u2013 so shrinkage is associated with a loss of function.\u201d', 
', Professor of psychiatry at Monash University Paul Fitzerald said while the findings of the study were important, they were unlikely to immediately affect clinical treatment.', 
', \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything that\u2019s really, fundamentally going to change overnight \u2013 but it\u2019s an important part of the jigsaw puzzle to put together a better understanding of what\u2019s going on in depression and that obviously has implications for developing better treatments down the track,\u201d he said.', 
', He added that researchers should next measure the volumes of individual regions within the hippocampus, that are each responsible for different cognitive functions.', 
', \u201cHaving a better understanding of what the regional volume differences are will provide greater capacity to draw conclusions,\u201d he said.', 
', \u201cHopefully having the involvement of the hippocampus in depression confirmed in such as substantive study will stimulate attempts to better understand what this means.\u201d', 
', It\u2019s important to note however, that the effects of depression on the brain are reversible with the right treatment for the individual.', 
', \u201cThe hippocampus is one of the most important regenerative areas of the brain,\u201d said Professor Hickie.',

', Chronic depression shrinks brain\u2019s memories and emotions', 
', The hippocampus, an area of the brain responsible for memory and emotion, shrinks in people with recurrent and poorly treated depression, a global study has found.', 
', The findings highlighted the importance of treating depression early, particularly in teenagers and young adults, the study concluded.', 
', Fifteen research institutes around the world, including from the US, Europe and Australia, collaborated to combine the results of their existing, smaller studies comparing the hippocampuses of depressed and healthy people.', 
', This allowed them to examine the brain magnetic resonance imaging data of 8,927 people, 1,728 of whom had major depression and the rest of whom were healthy.', 
', The researchers found 65% of the depressed study participants had recurrent depression and it was these people who had a smaller hippocampus, which is near the centre of the brain and is involved with long-term memory, forming new memories, and connecting emotions to those memories.', 
', The findings of the largest international study to compare brain volumes in people with and without major depression were published in the medical journal Molecular Psychiatry.', 
', The University of Sydney\u2019s brain and mind research institute led the Australian arm of the study. Its co-director, Professor Ian Hickie, said those people in the study experiencing their first depressive episode had a normal hippocampus size.', 
', \u201cBut the more episodes of depression a person had, the greater the reduction in hippocampus size,\u201d he said.', 
', \u201cSo recurrent or persistent depression does more harm to the hippocampus the more you leave it untreated. This largely settles the question of what comes first: the smaller hippocampus or the depression? The damage to the brain comes from recurrent illness.\u201d', 
', Hickie, who is also a national mental health commissioner, said it meant identifying and treating depression effectively when it first occurred was vital to prevent this damage, particularly among teenagers and young adults.', 
', But there was good evidence that with treatment, the damage was reversible, he said.', 
', \u201cOther studies have demonstrated reversibility, and the hippocampus is one of the unique areas of the brain that rapidly generates new connections between cells, and what are lost here are connections between cells rather than the cells themselves,\u201d Hickie said.', 
', \u201cTreating depression effectively does not just mean medicines. If you are unemployed, for example, and then sit in a room doing nothing as a result, this can shrink the hippocampus. So social interventions are just as important, and treatments such as fish oils are also thought to be neuro-protective.\u201d', 
', There was some evidence that the hippocampus was larger in those patients taking antidepressants, Hickie said, indicating these medications could have a protective effect.', 
', \u201cThere is a lot of nonsense said about antidepressants that constantly perpetuates the evils of them, but there is a good bit of evidence that they have a protective effect,\u201d he said.', 
', \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean they are the only treatment. There are, in fact, a broad range of treatments that should be explored, and in young people psychotherapy would often be explored as the first line of treatment, not medicines.\u201d', 
', A co-author of the study, Associate Professor Jim Lagopoulos, said the findings provided new insight on brain structures and possible mechanisms responsible for depression.', 
', It also indicated the findings that were possible through collaboration.', 
', \u201cDespite intensive research aimed at identifying brain structures linked to depression in recent decades, our understanding of what causes depression is still rudimentary,\u201d he said.', 
', \u201cOne reason for this has been the lack of sufficiently large studies, variability in the disease and treatments provided, and the complex interactions between clinical characteristics and brain structure.\u201d', 
', BBRF (formerly NARSAD)',  June 26, 2015', 
', Innovative Analysis Finds Unique Brain Structure Patterns in People with Schizophrenia', 
', In the first study of its kind, researchers have found unique brain structure patterns among people with ', schizophrenia', , providing insight into how the condition may develop and respond to treatment.', 
', Differences in brain structure have been noted in people with schizophrenia for decades. Ideally, such information should help us understand causes, progression and even treatment effects. Yet brain differences are influenced by many factors, some with opposing effects. Moreover, studies performed by different teams with different methods and standards have made it hard to distill results.', 
', Reporting June 2nd in ', Molecular Psychiatry', , an international team called the ENIGMA Schizophrenia Working Group\u2013\u201319 of whose members are current and past NARSAD grantees*\u2013\u2013presented a profile of brain abnormalities based on 15 schizophrenia cohorts worldwide. It was a first test of a way to analyze imaging data across traditional diagnostic boundaries. The aim: to generate \u201crobust and consistent anatomical fingerprints associated with brain disorders to help formulate improved diagnostic classifications based on both brain and behavioral evaluations,\u201d the team said.', 
', The ENIGMA group confirmed that people with schizophrenia had some smaller brain regions compared with healthy controls: the hippocampi, twin structures on either side of the brain that are associated with memory; the amygdalae, another paired structure found in both brain hemispheres that are important for emotional processing; and the thalami, twin structures associated with the relay of sensory and motor information. They also noted that intracranial volume, a general measure of brain size, was smaller than average in people with the illness.', 
', The team found two structures larger than normal in people with schizophrenia: the pallidum, involved in motivation and emotion; and the lateral ventricles, important cavities in the brain. These findings add to the evidence that schizophrenia is characterized by specific abnormalities of deep brain structures.', 
', The structural differences linked with schizophrenia in this study varied depending on factors such as age and sex, highlighting the variability of the illness. The biggest difference among people with schizophrenia was their smaller hippocampi, most pronounced among people who had never received medicine (typically, antipsychotic medicine) for their schizophrenia symptoms. This finding supports previous evidence that untreated schizophrenia may involve abnormal development of the hippocampus and that this can be reduced or reversed by treatment with antipsychotic medication.', 
', Future work will examine how these structural differences unfold across the lifespan in affected individuals who take antipsychotic medications and those who do not. The team calls for attention in future studies to environmental and lifestyle factors that can affect brain structure, including nutrition levels, water intake, exercise, drug use, social isolation, and stress. Future research by ENIGMA will include the study of brain characteristics among family members of people with schizophrenia, as well as different measures of brain structure, and possible relationships between the structural differences found in this study and individual patients\u2019 experience of schizophrenia symptoms.', 
', Biomedical Computation',  June 1, 2015 ', Schizophrenia and the Thinking Brain: A Matter of Gray Matter', 
', Schizophrenia patients often experience disorganized thinking, hallucinations, and problems with attention, memory and language. And that in turn suggests a problem with the brain\u2019s gray matter. \u201cThe gray matter is where the good stuff happens,\u201d says ', Jessica Turner, PhD,',  associate professor of psychology and neuroscience at Georgia State University. \u201cIt\u2019s where the synapses are\u2014where the cells fire. Without gray matter you can\u2019t think.\u201d', 
', 
', In imaging studies, researchers have long observed gray matter abnormalities in the brain structures of schizophrenic patients. Some such studies look at gray matter volume\u2014the amount of gray matter inside the borders of particular brain structures\u2014and some look at gray matter concentration\u2014the density of gray matter judged by characteristics of the voxels. Most look for clusters of voxels that differ from healthy controls (univariate approaches) while a few have begun looking for patterns of variation among those clusters (using multivariate approaches). Schizophrenia researchers also struggle with sample sizes that may be insufficient to reach statistical significance.', 
', Seeking to generate reliable, replicable results, Turner and her colleagues set out to conduct an international mega-analysis of gray matter concentration using a multivariate approach and a large dataset. They gathered together MRI images from eight prior studies, including scans of 936 healthy controls and 784 people diagnosed with schizophrenia. The method they used\u2014called parallel independent components analysis (ICA)\u2014lets the data speak for itself, revealing spatial patterns that co-occur in patients compared to healthy controls. And the data did speak, revealing nine \u201ccomponents\u201d or spatial patterns of interest. One pattern in particular caught the researchers\u2019 attention: reduced gray matter concentration in three areas (superior temporal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus and insula) of the brains of schizophrenic patients. And the pattern was highly replicable. \u201cYou can find this over and over again in chronic schizophrenia,\u201d Turner says. \u201cYou can put it in the bank.\u201d The work was published in the ', Schizophrenia Bulletin ', in 2014.', 
', 
', Is there potential for similar mega-analyses to reveal patterns in other mental illnesses? \u201cOh my goodness, yes!\u201d says Turner. But she also points to the ', ENIGMA consortium',  as a model for future work. Rather than a mega-analysis, which brings all the data to one lab, ENIGMA leaves the data where it is and sends software scripts to participating investigators whose results are then combined. \u201cENIGMA gets more power out of collaboration and cooperation than we could out of doing our own little studies,\u201d Turner says.', 
', For example, in 2008, the dynamic wave of gray matter loss that occurs as schizophrenia develops was revealed in a collaborative effort by 40 labs around the world led by ', Paul Thompson, PhD', , professor in the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California and director of the ENIGMA Consortium. In work published in 2008, Thompson and his colleagues also used time-lapse imaging to study the effects of various schizophrenia medications on the brain over the course of a year. Remarkably, they found one medication, olanzapine, that seemed to reduce gray matter loss compared with others.', 
', Turner and her colleagues are now combining imaging and genetics approaches to schizophrenia to see if there\u2019s a relationship between the pattern of gray matter loss they observed in their mega-analysis and genetics. \u201cLet\u2019s see if there\u2019s a relationship between this imaging pattern and cases/controls in GWAS,\u201d she says. An earlier project with a smaller number of subjects suggested the pattern of loss in schizophrenic patients is heritable. The results of Turner\u2019s team\u2019s genetics work are due out soon.', 
', ENIGMA, which stands for Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis, is also driving forward with the emerging field of neuroimaging genomics. The idea is to use brain images to screen the genome for common variants that might affect the brain. To date, such approaches have identified genes linked to such things as brain or hippocampal size as well as a few genes linked to Alzheimer\u2019s Disease.', 
', These early studies suggest, however, that neuroimaging sample sizes will need to be quite large if they are to avoid the problem of false positives\u2014genes that seem linked to imaging features in a particular sample but cannot be replicated in other samples. This concern has led to the ENIGMA Consortium\u2019s efforts to combine images from many labs.', 
', To date, the ENIGMA Consortium\u2019s Schizophrenia and Bipolar Working Groups have been focused on extracting meaningful information from neuroimages. But with support from the NIH\u2019s Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) program, they hope to soon publish work that ties these results to genetics.', 
', In a ', Nature ', paper',  published in January 2015, the ENIGMA network showed the potential promise of such work. That study found eight common variants (SNPs) that consistently predict the size of structures on brain MRI scans from over 30,000 people from 33 countries worldwide. Although non-genetic factors are clearly important, a tantalizing question is whether these genetic variants that correlate with brain structure also correlate with risk for brain diseases. For example, those eight genetic hotspots seem to affect the size of several brain regions implicated in schizophrenia, and some of them appear to affect risk for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). An ongoing partnership between the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium and ENIGMA is comparing the two groups\u2019 findings to see if risk genes for schizophrenia might exert their affect by influencing the composition and integrity of the brain.',

',  ', ADHD Institute ',  October 26, 2015 ', Future directions in the neurobiological understanding of ADHD: the ENIGMA Consortium ', 
', Understanding of the neurobiological correlates of ADHD may be further enhanced through the work of the Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) Consortium, a collaborative network of researchers working together to analyse neuroimaging data from 70 institutions around the world.', 
', A recent report has published the latest findings and future directions of ENIGMA studies, of which some are specifically related to ADHD. ENIGMA studies have analysed data from over 12,826 subjects, with a unified goal to bring together researchers with genome-wide images and data to build a comprehensive understanding of the brain that no individual site could investigate alone.', 
', There are several ENIGMA disease working groups, who assess the impact of genetic variants on the brain and behaviour in specific diseases; one such group is currently being formed for ADHD, which will analyse data from >1500 children and adults with the disorder and >2000 controls. Although ENIGMA researchers acknowledge that these data are likely to be heterogeneous in terms of duration of illness, disease aetiology, medication history, demographics, exposure to neuroprotective substances and many other factors, they also suggest that this will provide the opportunity to assess which of these factors are likely to affect disease expression in the brain with a sample size of sufficient power.', 
', Eventually, ENIGMA researchers hope to conduct cross-disorder meta-analyses on representative datasets from a range of psychiatric disorders, including ADHD, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, autism, obsessive-compulsive disorder and addiction, to identify common and distinctive patterns of brain morphometry with potential implications for diagnostic criteria.', 
', Medical News Today',  July 2, 2015 ', Major Depression tied to smaller hippocampus', 
', The largest international study to compare brain volumes of people with major depression to those of healthy people finds the former tend to have a significantly smaller hippocampus.', 
', Major ', depression',  is a serious mood disorder that affects around 1 in 6 people during their lifetime.', 
', When it occurs, persistent feelings of sadness, frustration, loss or anger disrupt everyday life and can endure for weeks, months or even years.', 
', The hippocampus \u2013 whose name comes from the Ancient Greek word for \u201cseahorse\u201d because of its shape \u2013 is an area of the brain that, among other things, is associated with forming new memories.', 
', The ENIGMA study researchers, including a group from the Brain and Mind Research Institute (BMRI) at the University of Sidney in Australia, suggest their findings highlight a need to treat depression when it first occurs \u2013 especially in adolescents and young adults.', 
', For the global study \u2013 which brings together 15 data sets from Europe, the USA and Australia \u2013 the team analyzed magnetic resonance imaging (', MRI', ) brain scans of nearly 9,000 participants: 1,728 with major depression and 7,199 healthy individuals.', 
', They also had access to clinical records of the participants with depression.', 
', The researchers report their findings in the journal ', Molecular Psychiatry', .', 
', The study has two main findings. The first \u2013 which confirms earlier clinical work at the BMRI \u2013 is that people with major depression have a smaller hippocampus.', 
', The second finding is that the first finding is largely accounted for by people with recurrent depression \u2013 they represented 65% of the major depression participants.', 
', Recurrent depression is a form of major depression where the depressive episodes come back regularly, interspersed with periods of no depression.', 
', Another interesting finding is that people whose major depression started before they reached the age of 21 also had a smaller hippocampus. The researchers suggest this is consistent with the idea that many of these youngsters go on to have recurrent depression.', 
', However, participants who had not experienced more than one episode of major depression \u2013 34% of those with major depression \u2013 did not have a smaller hippocampus than the healthy subjects.', 
', Jim Lagopoulos, an associate professor at BMRI, says these findings reveal new information about our brain structures and the mechanisms that might underlie depression. He adds:', 
', \u201cDespite intensive research aimed at identifying brain structures linked to depression in recent decades, our understanding of what causes depression is still rudimentary.\u201d', 
', He says one reason we know so little about this is the lack of studies with sufficiently large numbers of participants. Another reason is the disease varies widely, as do the treatments, and there are also complex interactions between some of the clinical characteristics and brain structure.', 
', Co-author Ian Hickie, professor and co-director of BMRI, says the clinical implications of the findings are that we probably need to treat first episodes of depression effectively, \u201cparticularly in teenagers and young adults, to prevent the brain changes that accompany recurrent depression.\u201d', 
', He says there is also a clear need for studies that can track changes in hippocampus size over time in people with depression. Results from such studies would help to clarify the question of cause and effect, \u201cwhether hippocampal abnormalities result from prolonged duration of chronic ', stress', , or represent a vulnerability factor for depression, or both.\u201d', 
', Prof. Lagopoulos also suggests the study lends support to the \u201cneurotrophic hypothesis of depression,\u201d the idea that people with chronic depression have certain differences in brain biology \u2013 such as sustained higher levels of glucocorticoid \u2013 that shrink the brain.', 
', Meanwhile, ', Medical News Today',  recently learned about new research that suggests ', brain inflammation links chronic pain',  with depression. The study is the first to discover brain ', inflammation',  caused by chronic nerve pain can affect signaling in regions associated with mood and motivation.', 
', The Conversation',  June 30, 2015 Depression damages parts of the brain, research concludes', 
', Brain damage is caused by persistent depression rather than being a predisposing factor for it, researchers have finally concluded after decades of unconfirmed hypothesising.', 
', A study published in ', Molecular Psychiatry',  today has proved once and for all that recurrent depression shrinks the hippocampus \u2013 an area of the brain responsible for forming new memories \u2013 leading to a loss of emotional and behavioural function.', 
', Hippocampal shrinkage has long been linked to depression but previous studies haven\u2019t been conclusive. Small sample sizes, varying types of depression and treatment levels, as well as variance in methods for collecting and interpreting results, have together led to inconsistent and often conflicting findings.', 
', Now, with the help of what co-author Ian Hickie from the Brain and Mind Research Institute has called \u201ca new spirit of collaboration\u201d a global, cross-sectional analysis of brain scans of 9,000 people has conclusively linked brain damage to depression.', 
', \u201cI think this resolves for good the issue that persistent experiences of depression hurts the brain,\u201d said Professor Hickie.', 
', Hippocampal shrinkage was pronounced among those for whom depression started early (before the age of 21), as well as people who had recurrent episodes. Professor Hickie noted that it was this persistence that \u201cdoes the damage\u201d.', 
', \u201cThose who have only ever had one episode do not have a smaller hippocampus, so it\u2019s not a predisposing factor but a consequence of the illness state.\u201d', 
', \u201cIt puts the emphasis then on early identification of the more severe persistent or recurrent cases. Importantly, in early identification systems you have to stick with those in who it persists or is recurrent, because they\u2019re the ones who will be most harmed from a brain point of view.\u201d', 
', Researchers used magnetic resonance imaged (MRI) brain scans and clinical data from 1,728 people with major depression and 7,199 healthy individuals, combining 15 datasets from Europe, the USA and Australia.', 
', The samples were obtained from the ', ENIGMA group',  database \u2013 an international consortium investigating psychiatric disorders.', 
', Scientia Professor & Head of the School of Psychiatry at UNSW Philip Mitchell said the use of the consortium\u2019s ongoing sample collection was \u201cbecoming a very powerful way of looking at what\u2019s happening in brain function\u201d.', 
', \u201cThis study confirms \u2013 in a very large sample \u2013 a finding that\u2019s been reported on quite a few occasions. It\u2019s interesting that none of the other subcortical areas of the brain have come up as consistently, so it also confirms that the hippocampus is particularly vulnerable to depression.\u201d', 
', The hippocampus is part of the brain\u2019s limbic system, or what\u2019s otherwise known as its emotional centre. The system also contains the amygdala, another part of the brain shown to be affected by depression.', 
', While the hippocampus plays an important role in consolidating and forming new memories, Professor Hickie explained that \u201cmemories\u201d weren\u2019t just about remembering passwords.', 
', \u201cYour whole sense of self depends on continuously understanding who you are in the world \u2013 your state of memory is not about just knowing how to do Sudoku or remembering your password \u2013 it\u2019s the whole concept we hold of ourselves,\u201d he said.', 
', \u201cWe\u2019ve seen in a lot of other animal experiments that when you shrink the hippocampus, you don\u2019t just change memory, you change all sorts of other behaviours associated with that \u2013 so shrinkage is associated with a loss of function.\u201d', 
', Professor of psychiatry at Monash University Paul Fitzerald said while the findings of the study were important, they were unlikely to immediately affect clinical treatment.', 
', \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything that\u2019s really, fundamentally going to change overnight \u2013 but it\u2019s an important part of the jigsaw puzzle to put together a better understanding of what\u2019s going on in depression and that obviously has implications for developing better treatments down the track,\u201d he said.', 
', He added that researchers should next measure the volumes of individual regions within the hippocampus, that are each responsible for different cognitive functions.', 
', \u201cHaving a better understanding of what the regional volume differences are will provide greater capacity to draw conclusions,\u201d he said.', 
', \u201cHopefully having the involvement of the hippocampus in depression confirmed in such as substantive study will stimulate attempts to better understand what this means.\u201d', 
', It\u2019s important to note however, that the effects of depression on the brain are reversible with the right treatment for the individual.', 
', \u201cThe hippocampus is one of the most important regenerative areas of the brain,\u201d said Professor Hickie.',

', Chronic depression shrinks brain\u2019s memories and emotions', 
', The hippocampus, an area of the brain responsible for memory and emotion, shrinks in people with recurrent and poorly treated depression, a global study has found.', 
', The findings highlighted the importance of treating depression early, particularly in teenagers and young adults, the study concluded.', 
', Fifteen research institutes around the world, including from the US, Europe and Australia, collaborated to combine the results of their existing, smaller studies comparing the hippocampuses of depressed and healthy people.', 
', This allowed them to examine the brain magnetic resonance imaging data of 8,927 people, 1,728 of whom had major depression and the rest of whom were healthy.', 
', The researchers found 65% of the depressed study participants had recurrent depression and it was these people who had a smaller hippocampus, which is near the centre of the brain and is involved with long-term memory, forming new memories, and connecting emotions to those memories.', 
', The findings of the largest international study to compare brain volumes in people with and without major depression were published in the medical journal Molecular Psychiatry.', 
', The University of Sydney\u2019s brain and mind research institute led the Australian arm of the study. Its co-director, Professor Ian Hickie, said those people in the study experiencing their first depressive episode had a normal hippocampus size.', 
', \u201cBut the more episodes of depression a person had, the greater the reduction in hippocampus size,\u201d he said.', 
', \u201cSo recurrent or persistent depression does more harm to the hippocampus the more you leave it untreated. This largely settles the question of what comes first: the smaller hippocampus or the depression? The damage to the brain comes from recurrent illness.\u201d', 
', Hickie, who is also a national mental health commissioner, said it meant identifying and treating depression effectively when it first occurred was vital to prevent this damage, particularly among teenagers and young adults.', 
', But there was good evidence that with treatment, the damage was reversible, he said.', 
', \u201cOther studies have demonstrated reversibility, and the hippocampus is one of the unique areas of the brain that rapidly generates new connections between cells, and what are lost here are connections between cells rather than the cells themselves,\u201d Hickie said.', 
', \u201cTreating depression effectively does not just mean medicines. If you are unemployed, for example, and then sit in a room doing nothing as a result, this can shrink the hippocampus. So social interventions are just as important, and treatments such as fish oils are also thought to be neuro-protective.\u201d', 
', There was some evidence that the hippocampus was larger in those patients taking antidepressants, Hickie said, indicating these medications could have a protective effect.', 
', \u201cThere is a lot of nonsense said about antidepressants that constantly perpetuates the evils of them, but there is a good bit of evidence that they have a protective effect,\u201d he said.', 
', \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean they are the only treatment. There are, in fact, a broad range of treatments that should be explored, and in young people psychotherapy would often be explored as the first line of treatment, not medicines.\u201d', 
', A co-author of the study, Associate Professor Jim Lagopoulos, said the findings provided new insight on brain structures and possible mechanisms responsible for depression.', 
', It also indicated the findings that were possible through collaboration.', 
', \u201cDespite intensive research aimed at identifying brain structures linked to depression in recent decades, our understanding of what causes depression is still rudimentary,\u201d he said.', 
', \u201cOne reason for this has been the lack of sufficiently large studies, variability in the disease and treatments provided, and the complex interactions between clinical characteristics and brain structure.\u201d', 
', BBRF (formerly NARSAD)',  June 26, 2015', 
', Innovative Analysis Finds Unique Brain Structure Patterns in People with Schizophrenia', 
', In the first study of its kind, researchers have found unique brain structure patterns among people with ', schizophrenia', , providing insight into how the condition may develop and respond to treatment.', 
', Differences in brain structure have been noted in people with schizophrenia for decades. Ideally, such information should help us understand causes, progression and even treatment effects. Yet brain differences are influenced by many factors, some with opposing effects. Moreover, studies performed by different teams with different methods and standards have made it hard to distill results.', 
', Reporting June 2nd in ', Molecular Psychiatry', , an international team called the ENIGMA Schizophrenia Working Group\u2013\u201319 of whose members are current and past NARSAD grantees*\u2013\u2013presented a profile of brain abnormalities based on 15 schizophrenia cohorts worldwide. It was a first test of a way to analyze imaging data across traditional diagnostic boundaries. The aim: to generate \u201crobust and consistent anatomical fingerprints associated with brain disorders to help formulate improved diagnostic classifications based on both brain and behavioral evaluations,\u201d the team said.', 
', The ENIGMA group confirmed that people with schizophrenia had some smaller brain regions compared with healthy controls: the hippocampi, twin structures on either side of the brain that are associated with memory; the amygdalae, another paired structure found in both brain hemispheres that are important for emotional processing; and the thalami, twin structures associated with the relay of sensory and motor information. They also noted that intracranial volume, a general measure of brain size, was smaller than average in people with the illness.', 
', The team found two structures larger than normal in people with schizophrenia: the pallidum, involved in motivation and emotion; and the lateral ventricles, important cavities in the brain. These findings add to the evidence that schizophrenia is characterized by specific abnormalities of deep brain structures.', 
', The structural differences linked with schizophrenia in this study varied depending on factors such as age and sex, highlighting the variability of the illness. The biggest difference among people with schizophrenia was their smaller hippocampi, most pronounced among people who had never received medicine (typically, antipsychotic medicine) for their schizophrenia symptoms. This finding supports previous evidence that untreated schizophrenia may involve abnormal development of the hippocampus and that this can be reduced or reversed by treatment with antipsychotic medication.', 
', Future work will examine how these structural differences unfold across the lifespan in affected individuals who take antipsychotic medications and those who do not. The team calls for attention in future studies to environmental and lifestyle factors that can affect brain structure, including nutrition levels, water intake, exercise, drug use, social isolation, and stress. Future research by ENIGMA will include the study of brain characteristics among family members of people with schizophrenia, as well as different measures of brain structure, and possible relationships between the structural differences found in this study and individual patients\u2019 experience of schizophrenia symptoms.', 
', Biomedical Computation',  June 1, 2015 ', Schizophrenia and the Thinking Brain: A Matter of Gray Matter', 
', Schizophrenia patients often experience disorganized thinking, hallucinations, and problems with attention, memory and language. And that in turn suggests a problem with the brain\u2019s gray matter. \u201cThe gray matter is where the good stuff happens,\u201d says ', Jessica Turner, PhD,',  associate professor of psychology and neuroscience at Georgia State University. \u201cIt\u2019s where the synapses are\u2014where the cells fire. Without gray matter you can\u2019t think.\u201d', 
', 
', In imaging studies, researchers have long observed gray matter abnormalities in the brain structures of schizophrenic patients. Some such studies look at gray matter volume\u2014the amount of gray matter inside the borders of particular brain structures\u2014and some look at gray matter concentration\u2014the density of gray matter judged by characteristics of the voxels. Most look for clusters of voxels that differ from healthy controls (univariate approaches) while a few have begun looking for patterns of variation among those clusters (using multivariate approaches). Schizophrenia researchers also struggle with sample sizes that may be insufficient to reach statistical significance.', 
', Seeking to generate reliable, replicable results, Turner and her colleagues set out to conduct an international mega-analysis of gray matter concentration using a multivariate approach and a large dataset. They gathered together MRI images from eight prior studies, including scans of 936 healthy controls and 784 people diagnosed with schizophrenia. The method they used\u2014called parallel independent components analysis (ICA)\u2014lets the data speak for itself, revealing spatial patterns that co-occur in patients compared to healthy controls. And the data did speak, revealing nine \u201ccomponents\u201d or spatial patterns of interest. One pattern in particular caught the researchers\u2019 attention: reduced gray matter concentration in three areas (superior temporal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus and insula) of the brains of schizophrenic patients. And the pattern was highly replicable. \u201cYou can find this over and over again in chronic schizophrenia,\u201d Turner says. \u201cYou can put it in the bank.\u201d The work was published in the ', Schizophrenia Bulletin ', in 2014.', 
', 
', Is there potential for similar mega-analyses to reveal patterns in other mental illnesses? \u201cOh my goodness, yes!\u201d says Turner. But she also points to the ', ENIGMA consortium',  as a model for future work. Rather than a mega-analysis, which brings all the data to one lab, ENIGMA leaves the data where it is and sends software scripts to participating investigators whose results are then combined. \u201cENIGMA gets more power out of collaboration and cooperation than we could out of doing our own little studies,\u201d Turner says.', 
', For example, in 2008, the dynamic wave of gray matter loss that occurs as schizophrenia develops was revealed in a collaborative effort by 40 labs around the world led by ', Paul Thompson, PhD', , professor in the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California and director of the ENIGMA Consortium. In work published in 2008, Thompson and his colleagues also used time-lapse imaging to study the effects of various schizophrenia medications on the brain over the course of a year. Remarkably, they found one medication, olanzapine, that seemed to reduce gray matter loss compared with others.', 
', Turner and her colleagues are now combining imaging and genetics approaches to schizophrenia to see if there\u2019s a relationship between the pattern of gray matter loss they observed in their mega-analysis and genetics. \u201cLet\u2019s see if there\u2019s a relationship between this imaging pattern and cases/controls in GWAS,\u201d she says. An earlier project with a smaller number of subjects suggested the pattern of loss in schizophrenic patients is heritable. The results of Turner\u2019s team\u2019s genetics work are due out soon.', 
', ENIGMA, which stands for Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis, is also driving forward with the emerging field of neuroimaging genomics. The idea is to use brain images to screen the genome for common variants that might affect the brain. To date, such approaches have identified genes linked to such things as brain or hippocampal size as well as a few genes linked to Alzheimer\u2019s Disease.', 
', These early studies suggest, however, that neuroimaging sample sizes will need to be quite large if they are to avoid the problem of false positives\u2014genes that seem linked to imaging features in a particular sample but cannot be replicated in other samples. This concern has led to the ENIGMA Consortium\u2019s efforts to combine images from many labs.', 
', To date, the ENIGMA Consortium\u2019s Schizophrenia and Bipolar Working Groups have been focused on extracting meaningful information from neuroimages. But with support from the NIH\u2019s Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) program, they hope to soon publish work that ties these results to genetics.', 
', In a ', Nature ', paper',  published in January 2015, the ENIGMA network showed the potential promise of such work. That study found eight common variants (SNPs) that consistently predict the size of structures on brain MRI scans from over 30,000 people from 33 countries worldwide. Although non-genetic factors are clearly important, a tantalizing question is whether these genetic variants that correlate with brain structure also correlate with risk for brain diseases. For example, those eight genetic hotspots seem to affect the size of several brain regions implicated in schizophrenia, and some of them appear to affect risk for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). An ongoing partnership between the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium and ENIGMA is comparing the two groups\u2019 findings to see if risk genes for schizophrenia might exert their affect by influencing the composition and integrity of the brain.',
