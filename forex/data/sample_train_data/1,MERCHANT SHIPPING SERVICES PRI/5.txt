Get it delivered straight to your inbox. Good morning. The battle over the battle of Obamacare repeal comes to a sort-of head today as both President Obama and Vice President\u2013elect Mike Pence march to Congress to shore up their respective troops. The pep talks won\u2019t change much. Like some staged Civil War reenactment, both sides will initially hurl themselves at each other with their rhetorical Bowie knives and revolvers. But the real fight will almost certainly slog on for months, as Kelsey Snell and Mike DeBonis have reported in the Washington Post. In terms of procedure, one oft-mentioned strategy is for Republican Congressional leaders (who have only a slim majority in the Senate) to use a convoluted parliamentary workaround called \u201cbudget reconciliation\u201d to strip away the financial circuitry and plumbing of the Affordable Care Act, even as they leave the legislative framework standing. Think of that approach as marauders rushing into a new construction project and absconding with all the electrical wiring and copper pipes. But there have been increasing cries\u2014including late yesterday from the American Medical Association, the influential guild for U.S. physicians\u2014not to dismantle the existing, if flawed, Affordable Care Act before settling upon a replacement. Even some diehard Obamacare antagonists, such as Sen. Rand Paul, have upped their warnings about killing the nearly seven-year-old legislation in piecemeal fashion without having a full substitute at the ready. So what would that replacement look like? Well, let me grab my crystal ball. Hmm, I see something\u2026.faint, but ah yes, it\u2019s becoming more clear. There\u2019s a bill\u2014many months from now. It makes sure not to pull the rug out from the 20 million or so Americans who have gotten health insurance under the ACA. (They have to have coverage of some kind, of course.) And this bill keeps the provisions that Donald Trump says he wants to keep\u2014and that millions of American voters want to keep\u2014like those that prevent insurers from blacklisting people with preexisting medical conditions and that allow parents to include their slacker twentysomething kids on their own policies. And natch, this legislation has mechanisms that makes sure there\u2019s an intact marketplace of insurers, and that people aren\u2019t freeloading off of the hefty premiums paid by hardworking Americans: This is a conservative plan, after all. Sure, some will scoff and say it looks an awful lot like Obamacare. But it\u2019s nothing like it. This bill, for instance, has a rock-ribbed Republican name. Yes, I can see the letters getting sharper now in the crystal ball: Freedom-care.","rendered":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThis essay appears in today\u2019s edition of the \u003C\u002Fem\u003EFortune \u003Cem\u003EBrainstorm Health Daily. \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ffortune.com\u002Fgetbrainstormhealth\u002F\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EGet it delivered\u003C\u002Fa\u003E straight to your inbox.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EGood morning.

Europe&#8217;s largest automaker has pledged billions to compensate U.S. owners of Volkswagen (VW) diesel-powered cars, but has so far rejected any compensation for the 8.5 million affected vehicles in Europe where different legal rules weaken the chances of affected customers winning a pay out. Instead, VW is in the process of removing the illicit software that cheated emissions tests and insists the technical fixes will inflict no loss of value on car owners in Europe. It hopes to have completed repairs to all affected vehicles by the end of the year. MyRight, which has gathered more than 100,000 VW owners through its website, has accused VW of breaching European Union law by selling cars with software that was banned under EU rules, according to the 93-page legal document seen by Reuters. Rather than seeking compensation for a decline in value, the lawsuit aims to force VW to repurchase the vehicles at the original price, myRight founder Jan-Eike Andresen said. MyRight has mandated U.S. law firm Hausfeld to pursue the claims. Hausfeld represents aggrieved VW owners and shareholders on both sides of the Atlantic. The purpose of the proceedings by myRight is to act as a model &#8211; resolving generic or common issues for other related cases. However, unlike in a U.S. class action, it does not have the legal effect of resolving all individual claims. To read Fortune&#8217;s in-depth account of the Volkswagen scandal, click here. Wolfsburg-based Volkswagen, has said the software fitted into the engine at the center of the scandal, the EA 189, does not violate European law and declined comment on the myRight suit. &#8220;We have taken note that myRight has announced the submission of diesel lawsuits for Jan. 3. The lawsuits have not yet been made available to us which is why we cannot comment on the contents at the moment,&#8221; the carmaker said. VW is already facing criminal investigations in Germany on the suspicion that it misled investors by withholding knowledge of the diesel scandal for over a year.

Yesterday, he went after GM \u2013 whose chief executive Mary Barra sits on his jobs council \u2013 for selling Chevrolet Cruzes assembled in Mexico to U.S. car dealers, when in fact almost all of the Cruzes sold in the U.S. last year were assembled in Lordstown, Ohio. As we now all know, factual accuracy is not the President-elect&#8217;s strong suit. Historically, this sort of meddling in markets was decried by free-market conservatives on the right. Yet Trump\u2019s latest moves are being criticized mainly from the left \u2013 with press outlets like Salon (Trump&#8217;s latest con job), Slate (Ford isn&#8217;t adding American jobs because of Donald Trump), and MSNBC arguing Trump is exaggerating his own role, or that the number of workers involved is relatively small. What these critics miss is that after decades of debating the merits of first Japanese-style and then Chinese-style national industrial policies, the U.S. suddenly has one of its own. Even before assuming office, Trump has tilted the playing field in a significant way. And it is going to be fascinating to watch the results.","rendered":"\u003Cp\u003EGood morning.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMy post yesterday about Trump\u2019s industrial policy was followed within hours by an announcement from Ford that it will kill \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ffortune.com\u002F2017\u002F01\u002F03\u002Fford-cancels-mexico-plant-trump\u002F\"\u003Ea planned $1.6 billion auto plant in Mexico\u003C\u002Fa\u003E and increase employment at a Michigan plant by 700 people instead.

He said Ford would have made the same decision even if Trump had not been elected.\r\n\r\nFord will cancel plans unveiled in April to spend $1.6 billion to build the new plant in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, a project Trump urged the automaker to abandon and called an \"absolute disgrace\" during the election campaign.\r\n\r\nThe No. 2 U.S. automaker also said it would invest $700 million to expand the Flat Rock, Michigan factory and would make new electric, hybrid and autonomous vehicles there.\r\n\r\nTrump's efforts to browbeat the U.S. car industry show he may go further than other modern presidents to try to influence corporate decisions, especially those related to trade and investment.\r\n\r\nIn a Twitter post hours before Ford's announcement, Trump wrote, \"General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!\" GM, the largest U.S. automaker, said making some of the Cruze cars in the plant in Coahuila, Mexico was part of its strategy to serve global customers, not sell those vehicles in the United States.\r\n\r\nTrump's GM tweet was his latest broadside aimed at an American company over jobs, imports and costs even before he takes office on Jan. 20.\r\n\r\nMexico's government said it regrets Ford's decision and has ensured that the company will reimburse San Luis Potosi state for any costs associated with the investment.\r\n\r\n\"Obviously, this isn't a good decision for us,\" said Mexico's economy minister, Ildefonso Guajardo.\r\n\r\nFord said it still will shift production from Michigan of its Focus compact car to an existing plant in Hermosillo, Mexico. Fields said he expects Michigan to give incentives for Ford's investment in Flat Rock.\r\n\r\nFord spokeswoman Jennifer Flake said the automaker will save $500 million by not opening the new plant in the near term, but will have some undisclosed costs to retool the other Mexican plant to build the Focus.\r\n\r\nFord shares closed up about 3.8 percent. GM shares rose about 0.9 percent.\r\n\r\n\u003Cstrong\u003ETRUMP NOTIFIED\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\r\n\r\nTop Ford executives personally notified Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence of their decision. Fields praised tax and regulatory proposals advocated by Trump and his fellow Republicans who control Congress.\r\n\r\n\"Our view is that we see a more positive U.S. manufacturing business environment under President-elect Trump and the pro-growth policies and proposals that he's talking about, so this is a vote of confidence for President-elect Trump and some of the policies that they may be pursuing,\" Fields said.\r\n\r\nUnion workers gathered at the Flat Rock factory cheered Fields' announcement. Hiring of the 700 new workers there will probably start in 2018 with the majority of it in 2020, Fields said.\r\n\r\nTrump said during the presidential campaign that if elected he would not allow Ford to open the new plant in Mexico and would slap hefty tariffs on imported Ford vehicles. Trump also accused Mexico of sending criminals and rapists into the United States and vowed to build a border wall to combat illegal immigration.\r\n\r\nSince winning the Nov. 8 election, Trump has targeted a wide range of American companies also including [f500link]United Technologies[\u002Ff500link] Inc, [f500link]Boeing[\u002Ff500link] Co and [f500link]Lockheed Martin[\u002Ff500link] Corp.

Daily: Wednesday, 4th January"},"content":{"plain":"Good morning. My post yesterday about Trump\u2019s industrial policy was followed within hours by an announcement from Ford that it will kill a planned $1.6 billion auto plant in Mexico and increase employment at a Michigan plant by 700 people instead. CEO Mark Fields said it was the right decision for the business, but also called it a \u201cvote of confidence\u201d in Trump\u2019s economic agenda. Expect more companies to follow suit. The combination of Trump\u2019s big stick \u2013 his bully Twitter pulpit plus the threat of punitive tariffs \u2013 combined with his even bigger bag of carrots \u2013 potential reductions in taxes, particularly on repatriated earnings, and in regulations \u2013 is a powerful combination. It\u2019s only a matter of time before Apple, IBM, and other companies follow suit. Never mind the fact that Trump\u2019s attacks on companies are neither very precise nor entirely fair. Yesterday, he went after GM \u2013 whose chief executive Mary Barra sits on his jobs council \u2013 for selling Chevrolet Cruzes assembled in Mexico to U.S. car dealers, when in fact almost all of the Cruzes sold in the U.S. last year were assembled in Lordstown, Ohio. As we now all know, factual accuracy is not the President-elect&#8217;s strong suit. Historically, this sort of meddling in markets was decried by free-market conservatives on the right. Yet Trump\u2019s latest moves are being criticized mainly from the left \u2013 with press outlets like Salon (Trump&#8217;s latest con job), Slate (Ford isn&#8217;t adding American jobs because of Donald Trump), and MSNBC arguing Trump is exaggerating his own role, or that the number of workers involved is relatively small.

VW has so far tried to satisfy such complaints with recalls and technical fixes, arguing all along that the devices didn\u2019t breach (badly-written) EU rules anyway, and that compensation was therefore not appropriate. While Germany generally avoids punitive legal settlements against companies, the sheer numbers involved create a material risk for VW: some 8 million cheating cars were sold in Europe, compared to only 600,000 in the U.S.. Owners have claimed they have suffered losses through lower resale values andhigher fuel bills. German law doesn\u2019t allow class actions.

He said Ford would have made the same decision even if Trump had not been elected.\r\n\r\nFord will cancel plans unveiled in April to spend $1.6 billion to build the new plant in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, a project Trump urged the automaker to abandon and called an \"absolute disgrace\" during the election campaign.\r\n\r\nThe No. 2 U.S. automaker also said it would invest $700 million to expand the Flat Rock, Michigan factory and would make new electric, hybrid and autonomous vehicles there.\r\n\r\nTrump's efforts to browbeat the U.S. car industry show he may go further than other modern presidents to try to influence corporate decisions, especially those related to trade and investment.\r\n\r\nIn a Twitter post hours before Ford's announcement, Trump wrote, \"General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!\" GM, the largest U.S. automaker, said making some of the Cruze cars in the plant in Coahuila, Mexico was part of its strategy to serve global customers, not sell those vehicles in the United States.\r\n\r\nTrump's GM tweet was his latest broadside aimed at an American company over jobs, imports and costs even before he takes office on Jan. 20.\r\n\r\nMexico's government said it regrets Ford's decision and has ensured that the company will reimburse San Luis Potosi state for any costs associated with the investment.\r\n\r\n\"Obviously, this isn't a good decision for us,\" said Mexico's economy minister, Ildefonso Guajardo.\r\n\r\nFord said it still will shift production from Michigan of its Focus compact car to an existing plant in Hermosillo, Mexico. Fields said he expects Michigan to give incentives for Ford's investment in Flat Rock.\r\n\r\nFord spokeswoman Jennifer Flake said the automaker will save $500 million by not opening the new plant in the near term, but will have some undisclosed costs to retool the other Mexican plant to build the Focus.\r\n\r\nFord shares closed up about 3.8 percent. GM shares rose about 0.9 percent.\r\n\r\n\u003Cstrong\u003ETRUMP NOTIFIED\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\r\n\r\nTop Ford executives personally notified Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence of their decision. Fields praised tax and regulatory proposals advocated by Trump and his fellow Republicans who control Congress.\r\n\r\n\"Our view is that we see a more positive U.S. manufacturing business environment under President-elect Trump and the pro-growth policies and proposals that he's talking about, so this is a vote of confidence for President-elect Trump and some of the policies that they may be pursuing,\" Fields said.\r\n\r\nUnion workers gathered at the Flat Rock factory cheered Fields' announcement. Hiring of the 700 new workers there will probably start in 2018 with the majority of it in 2020, Fields said.\r\n\r\nTrump said during the presidential campaign that if elected he would not allow Ford to open the new plant in Mexico and would slap hefty tariffs on imported Ford vehicles. Trump also accused Mexico of sending criminals and rapists into the United States and vowed to build a border wall to combat illegal immigration.\r\n\r\nSince winning the Nov. 8 election, Trump has targeted a wide range of American companies also including [f500link]United Technologies[\u002Ff500link] Inc, [f500link]Boeing[\u002Ff500link] Co and [f500link]Lockheed Martin[\u002Ff500link] Corp. Trump also has touted decisions by companies to keep some production in the United States, including United's Carrier unit in Indiana.\r\n\r\nTrump previously vowed to hit companies that shift production from America to other countries with a 35 percent tax on their exports into the United States. He also has denounced the North American Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Mexico and Canada.\r\n\r\nFields said there were no negotiations between Ford and the incoming president over canceling the Mexico plant or investing in Michigan.\r\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align:center;\"\u003E[fortune-brightcove videoid=5269310978001]\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\r\nFord will build a battery electric SUV with a 300-mile (482-km) driving range at the Michigan plant by 2020, and will launch production there by 2021 of a fully autonomous vehicle without a steering wheel or a brake pedal for use in ride services fleets. Ford also plans new hybrid versions of its F-150 pickup truck, Mustang and police vehicles by 2020.\r\n\r\nGM said it sold about 190,000 Cruze cars in the United States in 2016. All of the sedan versions sold in the United States, about 185,500, were built at its Lordstown, Ohio plant. About 4,500 hatchback Cruze versions were assembled in Mexico and sold in the United States.\r\n\r\n\u003Cem\u003EThis story has been updated.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","title":"Ford Cancels a $1.6 Billion Mexico Plant and Adds 700 Jobs in Michigan"},"video":null,"structured":null}],"fortune:primary_tag":[{"term_id":345093422,"name":"CEO Daily","slug":"ceo-daily-2","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":128203,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":571,"filter":"raw"}],"fortune:primary_section":[{"term_id":7885,"name":"Leadership","slug":"leadership","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":46727,"taxonomy":"category","description":"News and advice on leadership, management, jobs, careers, CEOs and anyone who aspires to the C-suite.","parent":0,"count":20253,"filter":"raw"}]}},{"id":1893212,"date":"2017-01-04T06:00:03","date_gmt":"2017-01-04T11:00:03","guid":{"rendered":"http:\u002F\u002Ffortune.com\u002F?p=1893212"},"paid":false,"modified":"2017-01-04T06:00:05","modified_gmt":"2017-01-04T11:00:05","slug":"stocks-2017-trump-january-effect","type":"post","subtype":"article","link":"http:\u002F\u002Ffortune.com\u002F2017\u002F01\u002F04\u002Fstocks-2017-trump-january-effect\u002F","shortlink":"http:\u002F\u002Ffor.tn\u002F2iLC3ee","dunce":"8432334743","title":{"rendered":"Why the Stock Market \u2018January Effect\u2019 Is No Longer Very Effective"},"content":{"plain":"January appears to have less of a pull on the market than it used to. Stock investors have long looked to January to tell them where the market might be headed for the rest of the year. And for good reason: Over the long haul, the-first-month-of-the-year indicator has seemed to work pretty well. Historically, stocks have tended to rise in January. And in general, when stocks were up at the end of January, eleven months later shares logged a positive year; when January was down, shares ended the year in the red. Only 27% of the time since 1929 have the market and January parted ways, according to data from Standard &amp; Poor&#8217;s. That seems like good news for 2017 (based on a very small sample size). The Dow Jones industrial average rose 119 points on Tuesday, or 0.6%, on the first trading day of 2017. Let the good times roll. The problem: Recently, the market connection between January and the rest of the year has been pretty lousy. During the past 11 years, stocks as measured by the S&amp;P 500 have fallen six times in January. Yet the market has ended down in only two of those six years. The divergence was particularly big last year. In 2016, the market had its worst start of the year since 1896, which Reuters, at the time, noted was seven years before the Wright brothers took flight and 12 years before Ford began selling the Model T. (On Tuesday, Ford scrapped plans to move some of its car production to Mexico.) The market ended the first month of last year down just over 5%. Nonetheless, in part thanks to the Trump Bump, 2016 ended up being a pretty good year for stocks, up 9.5%. Overall, the last few years have resulted in a lot of false negatives and false positives for the January indicator. And 2016 wasn&#8217;t the only year of big divergence. In 2009, for instance, the market dropped more than 8% in the first 31 days of the year. By March, though, the market was rebounding from the financial-crisis slump, and stocks ended that year up nearly 24%. In 2015, the January indicator worked, but just barely. Stocks fell 3% in January, but ended the year down just 1%. Erase January, and stocks were actually up the other 11 months of that year. Not exactly the bloodbath that January would have predicted. Even the first order January Effect\u2014that stocks tend to rise in January\u2014hasn&#8217;t been bankable lately. Again, of the past 11 years, only five have had up Januarys. What&#8217;s going on? One answer could have to do with index funds. More and more money has been shifting into passive investing\u2014funds that blindly track an index. Active fund managers typically sell some stocks in December either to lock in positive returns for the year, or to realize losses (for tax purposes), and then go on a buying spree in January. In the past, that in turn may have created momentum for the stock market for the rest of the year (or at least for a few months), as emotion-driven humans reacted to the spree and dove into the stock market, not wanting to miss out. Index investing, in contrast, lacks those behavioral quirks. Jeff Rubin, the director of research at investment firm Birinyi Associates, believes the January effect has waned because the January trade became too predictable. In order to capture the month&#8217;s gains, more investors have been buying stocks in December, leaving fewer left to buy in January. What&#8217;s more, the growing degree of market timing around the first 31 days of the year made January&#8217;s gains or losses an increasingly poor representation of how people actually thought about stocks or the economy. &#8220;The more people who pile into any trade, the less it works,&#8221; says Rubin. Another answer could be that in an era of historically low interest rates, the stock market, except for the disastrous 2008, has generally been up. Yes, Januarys in which the stock market has risen have been good predictors\u2014five out of the past five have coincided with up years. But, as a post on stock blog Seeking Alpha points out, that&#8217;s because the market has gone up in nine of the past 11 years. There are a number of better-than-average reasons to doubt the predictive powers of this January&#8217;s results, if stocks do finish the month with gains. The biggest is President-elect Donald Trump: Actions he may take to stymie global trade, for example, could hobble stocks. Add to that the fact that the Federal Reserve has indicated that it plans more interest rate increases this year. What&#8217;s more, as my colleague Shawn Tully writes this week, it looks likely that Wall Street&#8217;s big bet on soaring earnings could be a fantasy. So stocks could continue to rise in January, even past Dow 20,000, as investors remain on a Trump high. But don&#8217;t let that fool you. January&#8217;s ability to predict the stock market&#8217;s future is weaker than ever.","rendered":"\u003Cp\u003EJanuary appears to have less of a pull on the market than it used to.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EStock investors have long looked to January to tell them where the market might be headed for the rest of the year.

Clayton is a partner at Sullivan &amp; Cromwell who specializes in public and private mergers and offerings, an area that requires expertise on complex securities regulations and corporate governance. Clayton was not available to comment. He met with President-elect Donald Trump on Dec. 22 and appears to have overtaken a former U.S. Attorney, Debra Wong Yang, whose name had been floated as a top candidate in early December. Yang declined to comment. Clayton&#8217;s name surfaced relatively recently and he is one of a handful of other top contenders. Besides Yang, other names mentioned include former SEC commissioner Paul Atkins, lawyer Ralph Ferrara, and at least one candidate who used to work at a prominent Wall Street hedge fund, but whose name could not be learned. Activist investor Carl Icahn, who has been tapped by Republican Trump to play a bigger role in his administration, has been interviewing many of the of the potential SEC candidates. During the height of the 2008 financial crisis, Clayton worked on major deals involving big banks, including Barclays Capital&#8217;s acquisition of Lehman Brothers&#8217; assets, the sale of Bear Stearns to JP Morgan Chase, and the U.S. Treasury Department&#8217;s capital investment in Goldman Sachs , according to his law firm&#8217;s web site. The position of SEC chair will be very important to Wall Street investors and executives at Fortune 500 companies at a time when Trump has promised to roll back regulation in a variety of areas. Current SEC Chair Mary Jo White is slated to depart at the end of the Obama administration. Trump is to be sworn in as president on Jan. 20. For more on top jobs in the Trump administration, watch Fortune&#8217;s video: Under White, a former federal prosecutor, the SEC&#8217;s focus on enforcement increased. While some of the cases have involved big firms, the SEC has also sought to crack down on relatively minor violations, in the hopes it will deter bigger problems down the road. Some investors have said they would like to see the chair be an expert not only in enforcement matters, but have a greater understanding of markets and trading issues as U.S. firms face greater competition for global capital.","rendered":"\u003Cp\u003EWall Street lawyer\u003Cspan class=\"highlight\"\u003E Jay \u003C\u002Fspan\u003EClayton, who has worked on high-profile initial public offerings such as Alibaba Group, is a leading candidate to head the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in the Trump administration, two sources familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EClayton is a partner at Sullivan &amp; Cromwell who specializes in public and private mergers and offerings, an area that requires expertise on complex securities regulations and corporate governance.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EClayton was not available to comment.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHe met with President-elect Donald Trump on Dec. 22 and appears to have overtaken a former U.S. Attorney, Debra Wong Yang, whose name had been floated as a top candidate in early December.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYang declined to comment.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EClayton&#8217;s name surfaced relatively recently and he is one of a handful of other top contenders.

But not all are keen to connect with systems developed by Apple or Google. Ford Motor f and Toyota Motor tm have formed a consortium to accelerate the deployment of open source software aimed at giving consumers more options in how they connect and control their smartphone apps. The organization is called the SmartDeviceLink (SDL) Consortium, a reference to an open source software version of Ford&#8217;s AppLink. Mazda Motor mzday , PSA Group, Fuji Heavy Industries fujhy , and Suzuki Motor szkmy , are the first automaker members of the consortium. Suppliers Elektrobit ebttf , Harman har , Luxoft lxft , QNX, and Xevo have also joined the nonprofit organization. Get Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter. The formation of the consortium follows Toyota&#8217;s announcement last January that it planned to use the SDL software in its cars to give drivers command and control of smartphone apps through dashboard buttons, display screens, and voice recognition tech. Toyota plans to commercialize an infotainment system using SDL around 2018. The unusual agreement between the typically competitive companies showed the wariness of some automakers to hand over control to third-party companies\u2014namely Apple aapl and Google googl . Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are two connectivity systems that allow a smartphone to take over a car\u2019s center screen. Once users plug their smartphones into the car\u2019s USB ports, the phones&#8217; maps and navigation, music, and selected apps are integrated onto the central screen. Ford and Toyota argue that an open source code is a better approach, because developers and automakers working together can increase the quality and security of the software. If the industry adopts the software, developers would gain access to millions of vehicles and their drivers worldwide, while participating companies would still be able to retain control over the level of access outside parties have to vehicle data, the companies said. Ford has abandoned Apple&#8217;s and Google&#8217;s offerings, however. The company has taken an all-of-the-above approach to connectivity in the car. It&#8217;s keeping Sync, the in-car communications and entertainment system that lets you use your voice to make a call, listen to music, and select apps with its AppLink technology. At the same time, Ford is also adding Apple CarPlay and Android Auto to new models.","rendered":"\u003Cp\u003EAutomakers are scrambling to offer connectivity to their increasingly tech-savvy consumer base and offer seamless integration between cars and smartphones.

Get Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter. Trump, who has cast doubt on U.S. intelligence agencies&#8217; conclusion that Russia hacked Democratic Party computers, said over the weekend he would discuss the hacking allegations on Tuesday or Wednesday. With his tweet, he suggested he would not address the subject until he had been briefed by intelligence officials. Trump has scheduled a Jan. 11 news conference in New York. He is expected to discuss separating himself from his far-flung business empire, and other topics, including Russia, are likely to come up. U.S. intelligence officials have said they are confident Russia was behind the hacks of political figures in an effort to help Trump win the presidential election. For more on cybersecurity and the incoming White House administration, watch Fortune&#8217;s video: President Barack Obama retaliated to the hacking last week by ordering 35 Russian intelligence officials expelled from the United States and two Russian compounds shut down. Trump told reporters on Saturday at his Palm Beach, Florida, resort that he knew &#8220;things that other people don&#8217;t know&#8221; about the hacking, &#8220;so we cannot be sure&#8221; who was responsible.

Investors Are Betting On Samsung\u2019s Best Quarterly Profit in 3 Years"},"content":{"plain":"Samsung Electronics ssnlf is likely to forecast its best quarterly profit in nearly three years on Friday, analysts said, with robust memory chip sales easing the pain of the costly failure of a flagship smartphone. The South Korean firm discontinued sales of the Galaxy Note 7 phones after some of the devices caught fire, warning of a $2.1 billion hit to its profit in the fourth quarter of 2016 due to expenses tied to an ongoing global recall and lost sales. But investors are betting a surge in sales of memory chips and organic light-emitting diode screens for smartphones will translate to strong earnings growth for the October-December period and through 2017. Samsung&#8217;s operating profit likely rose for a second straight quarter to 8.4 trillion won ($7 billion) over October-December, according to a Thomson Reuters StarMine SmartEstimate derived from a survey of 15 analysts, up 37% from a year ago and the highest since the first quarter of 2014. &#8220;We look for the memory business to post a big earnings improvement and contribute 50% of its (Samsung&#8217;s) total operating profit for Q416,&#8221; Daiwa said in a report. Memory chip prices have spiked recently on demand for more firepower on mobile devices. But it is the sales of the higher-end 3D NAND chips which have rallied significantly, helping Samsung rake in profits given it is ahead of its rivals such as Toshiba tosbf and SK Hynix in the mass production of these chips, analysts said. For more on Samsung, watch Fortune&#8217;s video: Samsung&#8217;s semiconductor profit likely surged to a record 4.5 trillion won for the fourth quarter and 13.1 trillion won for 2016, Eugene Investment said in a report, adding chip earnings will grow further this year on firm demand. HDC Asset Management&#8217;s fund manager Park Jung-hoon agreed that the components business outlook appeared &#8220;pretty solid.&#8221; &#8220;We&#8217;ll have to see how the mobile business does &#8230; but I think Samsung&#8217;s operating profit should be able to come in somewhere around mid-30 trillion won range (this year).&#8221; For the recently ended quarter, Samsung&#8217;s mobile earnings likely rebounded from the dismal third quarter on healthy sales of the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge smartphones, analysts said. Hyundai Securities expects Samsung&#8217;s mobile division&#8217;s operating profit at 2.2 trillion won, in line with a year earlier and up sharply from 99 billion won in July-September. The company&#8217;s shares hit a record 1.831 million won on Tuesday this week ahead of the earnings forecast on Friday. They surged 43% in 2016\u2014the most since 2012\u2014suggesting investors did not expect a serious business impact from Samsung&#8217;s name being dragged into a growing political scandal in the country.","rendered":"\u003Cp\u003ESamsung Electronics \u003Cspan class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"ssnlf\"\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\u003Cspan class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\"\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003Ca class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\u002Fcompany\u002Fssnlf\u002F\"\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003Cspan class=\"ticker\"\u003Essnlf\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003Cspan class=\"change percent\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\n\t\t\t\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E is likely to forecast its best quarterly profit in nearly three years \u003Cspan class=\"aBn\"\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"aQJ\"\u003Eon Friday\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E, analysts said, with robust memory chip sales easing the pain of the costly failure of a flagship smartphone.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe South Korean firm discontinued sales of the Galaxy Note 7 phones after some of the devices caught fire, warning of a $2.1 billion hit to its profit in the fourth quarter of 2016 due to expenses tied to an ongoing global recall and lost sales.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut investors are betting a surge in sales of memory chips and organic light-emitting diode screens for smartphones will translate to strong earnings growth for the October-December period and through 2017.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESamsung&#8217;s operating profit likely rose for a second straight quarter to 8.4 trillion won ($7 billion) over October-December, according to a Thomson Reuters StarMine SmartEstimate derived from a survey of 15 analysts, up 37% from a year ago and the highest since the first quarter of 2014.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&#8220;We look for the memory business to post a big earnings improvement and contribute 50% of its (Samsung&#8217;s) total operating profit for Q416,&#8221; Daiwa said in a report.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMemory chip prices have spiked recently on demand for more firepower on mobile devices.

The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said the payments also resolve charges that TransUnion and Equifax lured consumers into enrolling in credit services advertised as free or costing only $1, but which could cost more than $200 a year. TransUnion will reimburse $13.93 million to consumers and pay a $3 million civil fine, while Equifax will reimburse $3.8 million and pay a $2.5 million civil fine, the CFPB said. Both companies will also modify their marketing practices, including by obtaining consent to enroll in credit-related services where fees kick in after free trials, and making it easier for consumers to cancel products they do not want. The CFPB said the wrongful conduct had occurred at TransUnion since July 2011 and at Equifax between July 2011 and March 2014, and violated the Dodd-Frank financial reform law. Many lenders rely on credit scores from TransUnion, Equifax and rival Experian experian-plc when lending money. But the CFPB said TransUnion and Equifax falsely represented that the credit scores they sold to consumers were the same scores that lenders used. &#8220;Credit scores are central to a consumer&#8217;s financial life and people deserve honest and accurate information about them,&#8221; CFPB Director Richard Cordray said in a statement. For more on credit report companies, watch Fortune&#8217;s video: Neither Chicago-based TransUnion nor Atlanta-based Equifax admitted or denied wrongdoing. TransUnion spokesman David Blumberg and Equifax spokeswoman Ines Gutzmer said their respective companies believe they have complied with applicable laws, and are committed to better educating consumers about their credit. Experian was not charged. A spokesman for the CFPB had no immediate additional comment. TransUnion, Equifax and Experian are among the 10 companies about which the CFPB receives the most consumer complaints. Several large banks and mortgage lenders are also on that list. In 2015, the credit reporting agencies agreed to improve how they fix mistakes and address disputes, under a separate settlement with 31 state attorneys general.","rendered":"\u003Cp\u003EA U.S. regulator on Tuesday ordered credit reporting agencies TransUnion and Equifax \u003Cspan class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"efx\"\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\u003Cspan class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\"\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003Ca class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ffortune.com\u002Ffortune500\u002Fequifax-801\u002F\"\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003Cspan class=\"ticker\"\u003Eefx\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003Cspan class=\"change percent\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\n\t\t\t\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E to pay more than $23.2 million in fines and restitution for deceiving consumers about the usefulness and cost of credit scores they bought.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said the payments also resolve charges that TransUnion and Equifax lured consumers into enrolling in credit services advertised as free or costing only $1, but which could cost more than $200 a year.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETransUnion will reimburse $13.93 million to consumers and pay a $3 million civil fine, while Equifax will reimburse $3.8 million and pay a $2.5 million civil fine, the CFPB said.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBoth companies will also modify their marketing practices, including by obtaining consent to enroll in credit-related services where fees kick in after free trials, and making it easier for consumers to cancel products they do not want.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe CFPB said the wrongful conduct had occurred at TransUnion since July 2011 and at Equifax between July 2011 and March 2014, and violated the Dodd-Frank financial reform law.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMany lenders rely on credit scores from TransUnion, Equifax and rival Experian \u003Cspan class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"experian-plc\"\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\u003Cspan class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\"\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003Ca class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\u002Fcompany\u002Fexperian-plc\u002F\"\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003Cspan class=\"ticker\"\u003Eexperian-plc\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003Cspan class=\"change percent\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\n\t\t\t\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E when lending money.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut the CFPB said TransUnion and Equifax falsely represented that the credit scores they sold to consumers were the same scores that lenders used.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&#8220;Credit scores are central to a consumer&#8217;s financial life and people deserve honest and accurate information about them,&#8221;

Cancels a $1.6 Billion Mexico Plant and Adds 700 Jobs in Michigan"},"content":{"plain":"Ford Motor Co f on Tuesday scrapped a planned Mexican car factory and added 700 jobs in Michigan following criticism by Donald Trump, as the U.S. president-elect turned his attention toward rival General Motors Co with the threat of a &#8220;big border tax&#8221; over compact cars made in Mexico. Ford CEO Mark Fields called the move &#8220;a vote of confidence&#8221; in Trump, but primarily a response to a decline in North American demand for small cars like those that would have been made at the Mexican plant. He said Ford would have made the same decision even if Trump had not been elected. Ford will cancel plans unveiled in April to spend $1.6 billion to build the new plant in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, a project Trump urged the automaker to abandon and called an &#8220;absolute disgrace&#8221; during the election campaign. The No. 2 U.S. automaker also said it would invest $700 million to expand the Flat Rock, Michigan factory and would make new electric, hybrid and autonomous vehicles there. Trump&#8217;s efforts to browbeat the U.S. car industry show he may go further than other modern presidents to try to influence corporate decisions, especially those related to trade and investment. In a Twitter post hours before Ford&#8217;s announcement, Trump wrote, &#8220;General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!&#8221; GM, the largest U.S. automaker, said making some of the Cruze cars in the plant in Coahuila, Mexico was part of its strategy to serve global customers, not sell those vehicles in the United States. Trump&#8217;s GM tweet was his latest broadside aimed at an American company over jobs, imports and costs even before he takes office on Jan. 20. Mexico&#8217;s government said it regrets Ford&#8217;s decision and has ensured that the company will reimburse San Luis Potosi state for any costs associated with the investment. &#8220;Obviously, this isn&#8217;t a good decision for us,&#8221; said Mexico&#8217;s economy minister, Ildefonso Guajardo. Ford said it still will shift production from Michigan of its Focus compact car to an existing plant in Hermosillo, Mexico. Fields said he expects Michigan to give incentives for Ford&#8217;s investment in Flat Rock. Ford spokeswoman Jennifer Flake said the automaker will save $500 million by not opening the new plant in the near term, but will have some undisclosed costs to retool the other Mexican plant to build the Focus. Ford shares closed up about 3.8 percent. GM shares rose about 0.9 percent. TRUMP NOTIFIED Top Ford executives personally notified Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence of their decision. Fields praised tax and regulatory proposals advocated by Trump and his fellow Republicans who control Congress. &#8220;Our view is that we see a more positive U.S. manufacturing business environment under President-elect Trump and the pro-growth policies and proposals that he&#8217;s talking about, so this is a vote of confidence for President-elect Trump and some of the policies that they may be pursuing,&#8221; Fields said. Union workers gathered at the Flat Rock factory cheered Fields&#8217; announcement. Hiring of the 700 new workers there will probably start in 2018 with the majority of it in 2020, Fields said. Trump said during the presidential campaign that if elected he would not allow Ford to open the new plant in Mexico and would slap hefty tariffs on imported Ford vehicles. Trump also accused Mexico of sending criminals and rapists into the United States and vowed to build a border wall to combat illegal immigration. Since winning the Nov. 8 election, Trump has targeted a wide range of American companies also including United Technologies Inc, Boeing Co and Lockheed Martin Corp. Trump also has touted decisions by companies to keep some production in the United States, including United&#8217;s Carrier unit in Indiana. Trump previously vowed to hit companies that shift production from America to other countries with a 35 percent tax on their exports into the United States. He also has denounced the North American Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Mexico and Canada. Fields said there were no negotiations between Ford and the incoming president over canceling the Mexico plant or investing in Michigan. Ford will build a battery electric SUV with a 300-mile (482-km) driving range at the Michigan plant by 2020, and will launch production there by 2021 of a fully autonomous vehicle without a steering wheel or a brake pedal for use in ride services fleets. Ford also plans new hybrid versions of its F-150 pickup truck, Mustang and police vehicles by 2020. GM said it sold about 190,000 Cruze cars in the United States in 2016. All of the sedan versions sold in the United States, about 185,500, were built at its Lordstown, Ohio plant. About 4,500 hatchback Cruze versions were assembled in Mexico and sold in the United States.

for 2016 overall, the retail giant said on Wednesday. The news offers new data points for investors who are hoping Amazon will post a profit for the fourth quarter when it announces results in the coming weeks. Seattle-based Amazon, known for its roller coaster results in years past, has forecast that operating income would range from nothing to $1.25 billion. Amazon, the world&#8217;s largest online retailer, has said the 2016 holiday was its best-ever shopping season. However, high spending on warehouses and video production are expected to drag on profits. More sellers are paying the company to store, pack and ship their goods through the Fulfillment by Amazon service. Amazon more than doubled the items it delivered for other sellers in 2016 from the year prior to exceed two billion, a spokesman said. Active sellers using the fulfillment service rose more than 70 percent in the year, Amazon said on Wednesday. It did not specify the total number of vendors. &nbsp; Third-party sales were &#8220;record-breaking&#8221; in 2016, Peter Faricy, vice president for Amazon Marketplace, said in the statement. Amazon takes a cut of the proceeds. Amazon will likely top its profit-margin guidance for the fourth quarter, Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy said in a research note last week. Price competition seemed subdued in December and Amazon avoided delivery bottlenecks it experienced in 2015, he said. Cyber Monday, a shopping spree four days after Thanksgiving, is another indicator. Shoppers ordered more than 28 million items from third-party sellers this year, versus more than 23 million items on Cyber Monday in 2015, Amazon said. Amazon is building its own fleet of planes to handle the rise in orders and supplement shipping that it contracts out to companies like FedEx Corp and United Parcel Service Inc . Data reviewed by Reuters and interviews with airport officials show that Amazon has loaded these aircraft with big but lightweight boxes, helping it dodge fees from cargo carriers increasingly pricing based on volume rather than weight. The company does not disclose the revenue it generates from its Fulfillment by Amazon service. Chief Executive Jeff Bezos has said that close to 50 percent of the units purchased on Amazon come from third-party vendors. Clicks on product advertisements paid for by third-party sellers grew 150 percent, Amazon said.","rendered":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ffortune.com\u002Ffortune500\u002Famazoncom-18\u002F\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EAmazon.com\u003C\u002Fa\u003E \u003Cspan class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"amzn\"\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\u003Cspan class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\"\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003Ca class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ffortune.com\u002Ffortune500\u002Famazon-com-18\u002F\"\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003Cspan class=\"ticker\"\u003Eamzn\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003Cspan class=\"change percent\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\n\t\t\t\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E shipped 50 percent more items this holiday season than last for third-party vendors and doubled the amount for 2016 overall, the retail giant said on Wednesday.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe news offers new data points for investors who are hoping Amazon will post a profit for the fourth quarter when it announces results in the coming weeks.

integration between cars and smartphones. But not all are keen to connect with systems developed by Apple or Google. Ford Motor f and Toyota Motor tm have formed a consortium to accelerate the deployment of open source software aimed at giving consumers more options in how they connect and control their smartphone apps. The organization is called the SmartDeviceLink (SDL) Consortium, a reference to an open source software version of Ford&#8217;s AppLink. Mazda Motor mzday , PSA Group, Fuji Heavy Industries fujhy , and Suzuki Motor szkmy , are the first automaker members of the consortium. Suppliers Elektrobit ebttf , Harman har , Luxoft lxft , QNX, and Xevo have also joined the nonprofit organization. Get Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter. The formation of the consortium follows Toyota&#8217;s announcement last January that it planned to use the SDL software in its cars to give drivers command and control of smartphone apps through dashboard buttons, display screens, and voice recognition tech. Toyota plans to commercialize an infotainment system using SDL around 2018. The unusual agreement between the typically competitive companies showed the wariness of some automakers to hand over control to third-party companies\u2014namely Apple aapl and Google googl . Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are two connectivity systems that allow a smartphone to take over a car\u2019s center screen. Once users plug their smartphones into the car\u2019s USB ports, the phones&#8217; maps and navigation, music, and selected apps are integrated onto the central screen. Ford and Toyota argue that an open source code is a better approach, because developers and automakers working together can increase the quality and security of the software. If the industry adopts the software, developers would gain access to millions of vehicles and their drivers worldwide, while participating companies would still be able to retain control over the level of access outside parties have to vehicle data, the companies said. Ford has abandoned Apple&#8217;s and Google&#8217;s offerings, however. The company has taken an all-of-the-above approach to connectivity in the car. It&#8217;s keeping Sync, the in-car communications and entertainment system that lets you use your voice to make a call, listen to music, and select apps with its AppLink technology. At the same time, Ford is also adding Apple CarPlay and Android Auto to new models.","rendered":"\u003Cp\u003EAutomakers are scrambling to offer connectivity to their increasingly tech-savvy consumer base and offer seamless integration between cars and smartphones.

Investors Are Betting On Samsung\u2019s Best Quarterly Profit in 3 Years"},"content":{"plain":"Samsung Electronics ssnlf is likely to forecast its best quarterly profit in nearly three years on Friday, analysts said, with robust memory chip sales easing the pain of the costly failure of a flagship smartphone. The South Korean firm discontinued sales of the Galaxy Note 7 phones after some of the devices caught fire, warning of a $2.1 billion hit to its profit in the fourth quarter of 2016 due to expenses tied to an ongoing global recall and lost sales. But investors are betting a surge in sales of memory chips and organic light-emitting diode screens for smartphones will translate to strong earnings growth for the October-December period and through 2017. Samsung&#8217;s operating profit likely rose for a second straight quarter to 8.4 trillion won ($7 billion) over October-December, according to a Thomson Reuters StarMine SmartEstimate derived from a survey of 15 analysts, up 37% from a year ago and the highest since the first quarter of 2014. &#8220;We look for the memory business to post a big earnings improvement and contribute 50% of its (Samsung&#8217;s) total operating profit for Q416,&#8221; Daiwa said in a report. Memory chip prices have spiked recently on demand for more firepower on mobile devices. But it is the sales of the higher-end 3D NAND chips which have rallied significantly, helping Samsung rake in profits given it is ahead of its rivals such as Toshiba tosbf and SK Hynix in the mass production of these chips, analysts said. For more on Samsung, watch Fortune&#8217;s video: Samsung&#8217;s semiconductor profit likely surged to a record 4.5 trillion won for the fourth quarter and 13.1 trillion won for 2016, Eugene Investment said in a report, adding chip earnings will grow further this year on firm demand. HDC Asset Management&#8217;s fund manager Park Jung-hoon agreed that the components business outlook appeared &#8220;pretty solid.&#8221; &#8220;We&#8217;ll have to see how the mobile business does &#8230; but I think Samsung&#8217;s operating profit should be able to come in somewhere around mid-30 trillion won range (this year).&#8221; For the recently ended quarter, Samsung&#8217;s mobile earnings likely rebounded from the dismal third quarter on healthy sales of the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge smartphones, analysts said. Hyundai Securities expects Samsung&#8217;s mobile division&#8217;s operating profit at 2.2 trillion won, in line with a year earlier and up sharply from 99 billion won in July-September. The company&#8217;s shares hit a record 1.831 million won on Tuesday this week ahead of the earnings forecast on Friday. They surged 43% in 2016\u2014the most since 2012\u2014suggesting investors did not expect a serious business impact from Samsung&#8217;s name being dragged into a growing political scandal in the country.","rendered":"\u003Cp\u003ESamsung Electronics \u003Cspan class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"ssnlf\"\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\u003Cspan class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\"\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003Ca class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\u002Fcompany\u002Fssnlf\u002F\"\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003Cspan class=\"ticker\"\u003Essnlf\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003Cspan class=\"change percent\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\n\t\t\t\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E is likely to forecast its best quarterly profit in nearly three years \u003Cspan class=\"aBn\"\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"aQJ\"\u003Eon Friday\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E, analysts said, with robust memory chip sales easing the pain of the costly failure of a flagship smartphone.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe South Korean firm discontinued sales of the Galaxy Note 7 phones after some of the devices caught fire, warning of a $2.1 billion hit to its profit in the fourth quarter of 2016 due to expenses tied to an ongoing global recall and lost sales.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut investors are betting a surge in sales of memory chips and organic light-emitting diode screens for smartphones will translate to strong earnings growth for the October-December period and through 2017.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESamsung&#8217;s operating profit likely rose for a second straight quarter to 8.4 trillion won ($7 billion) over October-December, according to a Thomson Reuters StarMine SmartEstimate derived from a survey of 15 analysts, up 37% from a year ago and the highest since the first quarter of 2014.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&#8220;We look for the memory business to post a big earnings improvement and contribute 50% of its (Samsung&#8217;s) total operating profit for Q416,&#8221; Daiwa said in a report.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMemory chip prices have spiked recently on demand for more firepower on mobile devices.

Japanese conglomerate of misreporting profits by 40 billion yen ($339.59 million) over three years. The revelations add to a series of accounting troubles swirling around Toshiba, which was downgraded by ratings agencies last week after it admitted it may face a multi-billion dollar writedown over its U.S. nuclear business. The Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported on Tuesday, when Tokyo markets were closed, that the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission would present allegations of accounting fraud to prosecutors, who had previously declined to investigate due to a lack of evidence. The watchdog found that Toshiba had reported profit gains in its computer operations during the 2012-2014 financial years, when the section had not generated any profit, the newspaper reported, citing unidentified sources. Toshiba&#8217;s two CEOs and a chairman at the helm of the company during that period were involved in the alleged cheating, it added. The investigation could open the way to formal criminal charges against the company and its former executives. Officials at Toshiba were not immediately available for comment. Toshiba shares traded at 288.40 yen, up 1.9%, at 01:38 GMT, after sliding to 263.05 yen in earlier trade.

Xerox&#8217;s sibling business services unit, Conduent, spun off into a separate company on Tuesday. It must now find a way to lift its growth amid stagnant sales and a tough market. Xerox acquired the roots of Conduent, which handles everything from human resources services for healthcare companies to mobile parking apps for the city of Los Angeles, by buying Affiliated Computer Services for nearly $6.4 billion in 2010. The deal was supposed to help Xerox find another source of revenue beyond it&#8217;s core copier and printing business. But like other big business tech companies like IBM and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Xerox&#8217;s overall revenue has declined in recent years. With few people printing and copying, Xerox&#8217;s annual sales have dropped each year since 2011. During much of that time, Xerox&#8217;s business services group struggled. In a nine-month period ending in September, Conduent had $4.9 billion in revenue, or nearly flat compared to the previous year. Xerox&#8217;s executives say that two smaller, more nimble businesses will be able to better adapt to a rapidly changing technology world. The argument echoes that of Hewlett Packard, which split into two companies last year. But Wall Street didn&#8217;t exactly give Conduent a happy birthday. In its first day of trading, the company&#8217;s shares fell 8% to $13.72. In this edited interview with Fortune, Conduent CEO Ashok Vemuri talks about splitting from Xerox xrx , competing with IBM ibm and HPE hpe , and new beginnings. Fortune: Tell me about splitting from Xerox. Vemuri: If you go back six to seven years when Xerox acquired a company called ACS [Affiliated Computer Services] in 2010, the thesis of that acquisition was that Xerox was a hardware manufacturing company. This was during a recession, and management thought the best would be to serve your clients soup-to-nuts, if you will, by acquiring a services company. It was very similar to other companies\u2014think Dell with Perot [$3.9 billion deal was announced in 2009], HP with EDS [$13.9 billion deal was announced in 2008] That construct of combining hardware with services didn\u2019t necessarily pan out. So, it was thought that our two companies would be better served if they were sliced off and were allowed to control their own destiny and serve their own clients, their own market, their own technology, etc. Get Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter. Why did hardware companies think that they also had to have business services? It was the height of the recession. This was considered a sort of natural hedge in terms of buying revenue. Secondly, it was believed that if you sold a piece of equipment to a client, they were servicing that equipment with somebody else. So why would I not, if I sold you that equipment, service it instead? Thirdly, services companies were on the ascendancy. Remember, even 10 years ago, print, paper, ink was on decline, and it continues to be so. The services business is where the margins are\u2014where the cash flow is\u2014and your need for spending is much less. If you look at an equipment provider like Xerox, it\u2019s more a finance operating lease company, because they fund your purchase of a printer. A services business is asset light. It does not require you to invest your balance sheet in a big way. Some analysts believe the downside of a service company, however, are the costs of hiring employees, which can eat into profitability. That\u2019s wrong. That is the conventional way of thinking about services businesses. In our model, 80% of our business is transactions based. We do everything off the back of technology. That allows me to add a multitude of services off a particular platform. Let me give you an example. If I have three or four clients, I cannot repurpose my people because they aren\u2019t fungible. I can\u2019t say, \u201cHey, for two hours you be on the call center, for two hours you do transaction processing, for two hours you work for Client A, and for two hours you work for Client B.\u201d But I can do it if I do it on the back of technology, because my platform aggregates and creates air pockets that allow me to work for multiple clients. I can repurpose my platform to do multiple functions. With people, I can\u2019t expect them to work more than eight hours. What are the services that your company does? We serve two broad segments. One is the public sector. We work with all 50 U.S. states and over 500 government entities worldwide. We do a lot of work in transportation. Think about parking: You use a parking app pay over the phone, and the phone reminds you after 45 minutes to pay more We are now handling road tolls\u2014so think EasyPass in California and SunPass in Florida. We are the world\u2019s largest prepaid card processor. We do things like welfare, Social Security, Food Stamps. The other part of the business is commercial. We work with 74 of the top Fortune 100 companies. We support them on mission-critical systems. Apple aapl co-founder Steve Jobs once publicly criticized Xerox for not capitalizing on its technology. Correct. In a similar way, a lot of Conduent\u2019s technology was invented in Xerox over the last six years. The ACS story is six years old; a little is left, but a lot of that is new and a lot of that was invented in Xerox. Now that you\u2019re an independent company, how do you balance spending on research into new technologies with pleasing investors? Clearly today, technology is at a place where you don\u2019t necessarily have to build components in-house; you can buy them from others. We have to rid ourselves of the sensibility we\u2019ve had that if it\u2019s not invented in-house it\u2019s not worth looking at. We are now a public company, so our research dollars have to give a return in the year that I give the dollar in, unlike in the past in which the time to yield was like five to seven years. Having said that, technology will be the underpinning of every process we bring. Therefore we must invest in our technology platform and make it modern. The speed of technology is changing and the way it is being consumed is dramatically changing in such a short time frame that our investments have to reflect that time horizon as well as the fact that these changes are happening. Who are your biggest competitors? We are in a wide range of industries, so we have a lot of them. A lot of them are very niche and specialized companies. Across our various businesses, we see as competitors like Accenture, we see IBM, we see HPE. My advantage is I\u2019m a pure-play business process provider. I\u2019m the largest in revenue and in size and scale. For more about enterprise technology, watch: How do you distinguish yourselves from the big business services groups of companies like IBM that may brag that their technology separates them from the pack? Technology is a commodity. I can buy technology every other day at half the price I paid the day before yesterday. The technology product isn\u2019t going to give you any differentiation. What gives you differentiation is what you do with that technology. If I understand processes and have functional and domain knowledge, then I can actually leverage that technology and literally make it jump through hoops to provide me the answer or the outcome that the business really needs.","rendered":"\u003Cp\u003EIt&#8217;s a new beginning for Xerox&#8217;s spawn.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EXerox&#8217;s sibling business services unit, Conduent, spun off into a separate company on Tuesday.

The services business is where the margins are\u2014where the cash flow is\u2014and your need for spending is much less.

The French cosmetics and beauty giant this week will debut a connected smart hairbrush called the Krastase Hair Coach at CES 2017 in Las Vegas. The device is a brush that comes with sensors that L&#8217;Oreal promises will measure the quality of a user&#8217;s hair as well as the effects of different hair care routines. The gadget will retail for &#8220;under $200&#8221; and will be available this fall at Krastase hair salons as well as online. &#8220;We really want to think about what the connected bathroom will look like in the future for the beauty industry,&#8221; Guive Balooch, VP of L&#8217;Oreal&#8217;s Technology Incubator, told Fortune in an interview. The Krastase Hair Coach\u2014with technology powered by Nokia-owned Withings\u2014features a microphone (which listens to the sound of brushing to identify patterns); an accelerometer and a gyroscope (to analyze brushing patterns and count brush strokes); and sensors (to determine if the the brush is being used on dry or wet hair). Via connection with an app, the brush can tell a user how how often hair is brushed\u2014and also warn consumers if they are brushing too hard. The brush vibrates to warn against over brushing. Balooch says the brush also gives a user a daily hair breakage score\u2014by measuring the overall quality of the hair. The device then provides tips based on the user&#8217;s hair type and brushing behavior (and of course, makes a few helpful recommendations for Krastase beauty products). &#8220;It will basically be your hair coach,&#8221; Balooch said. &#8220;When you brush you hair, it will do a good job to make sure your hair is smooth.&#8221; The smart hairbrush is the latest device from L&#8217;Oreal as the beauty behemoth behind Garnier, Maybelline and Kiehl&#8217;s thinks about how it can infuse technology into those well-established consumer brands. L&#8217;Oreal itself set up an internal, tech-focused startup several years ago in Silicon Valley and has recently made investments in external digital and technology startups. One of the incubator&#8217;s first products, a stretchable skin sensor designed to monitor ultraviolet light exposure called My UV Patch, debuted at CES last year. Of course, all this raises the obvious question: do bathrooms across the globe really need a &#8220;smart&#8221; hairbrush? Most can likely live without it\u2014but at CES, a slew of Internet-connected home devices debut each year as inventors envision a world where sensors invade more aspects of our day-to-day lives. The idea is that data from these sensors can improve or lives. Many of these devices are increasingly targeting the home\u2014L&#8217;Oreal is specifically focusing on the bathroom. Balooch says his team&#8217;s goal is to hone in on real needs and provide data and information to improve a consumer&#8217;s routine. Hair breakage is a top beauty concern for women as it relates to their hair\u2014so helping them avoid split ends is a need that L&#8217;Oreal thinks it can meet with the smart hairbrush. L&#8217;Oreal says the goal is for the app and device to work as simply as possible. &#8220;It needs to connect to something they already have in their day-to-day routine,&#8221; Balooch said. When it comes to L&#8217;Oreal&#8217;s CES product debuts, it also must comb through the company&#8217;s deep bench of brands to figure out what makes most sense for the branding name to attach to the technology. Dermatological skincare brand La Roche-Posay got the nod for last year&#8217;s My UV Patch, while for 2017, hair care products brand Krastase was selected because it has a luxurious connotation among consumers.","rendered":"\u003Cp\u003EL&#8217;Oreal thinks your hairbrush could be a little smarter.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe French cosmetics and beauty giant this week will debut a connected smart hairbrush called the Krastase Hair Coach at CES 2017 in Las Vegas.

How Nokia Plans to Invest in Smart Devices"},"content":{"plain":"Nokia made a splash at CES 2017 with help from its smart home subsidiary Withings. The Finnish phone maker on Tuesday announced a few new devices that it says will help its Withings brand, which Nokia NOK acquired in May 2016 for an undisclosed sum, continue to compete in the smart devices market. Chief among those announcements was the new Withings Home Plus, a smart HD camera that can not only record what&#8217;s happening in the home, but also receive notifications in the event of an unusual noise, monitor indoor air quality, and keep a watchful eye on a baby with its baby-monitoring feature. Withings Home Plus can also stream video to a user&#8217;s smartphone. Get Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter The Home Plus is designed to work with Withings&#8217; own mobile-monitoring app for Android and iOS, but Nokia was quick to point out that the camera is one of the first of its kind to support Apple&#8217;s HomeKit, a service that lets third-party companies integrate control over their products into Apple&#8217;s Home app. The Home app lives on iOS and acts as a central hub for users to control the many smart devices throughout the home. Nokia says that its Withings Home Plus will be available to customers in the first quarter for $199. In addition to the camera, Nokia said that it&#8217;s improving its Withings line of products with the release on Jan. 4 of the Withings Steel HR activity tracker. The Steel HR can track a wearer&#8217;s health by seeing how far they&#8217;ve walked and what kinds of activities they&#8217;ve engaged in, like playing basketball, soccer, or even boxing. The Steel HR can also track heart rate. For more about Nokia, watch: Because the Steel HR is designed to be more than an activity tracker, Nokia says the Withings wearable is also a timepiece with an analog-style watch face to help folks tell time. It integrates with an Android smartphone goog or iPhone aapl to deliver smartphone notifications. The Steel HR will be available 36mm and 40mm sizes, and will retail for a starting price of $200. Nokia says it&#8217;ll initially be on sale through its Withings online store, and will then find its way to retail stores in mid-January. One other tidbit from Nokia&#8217;s CES announcement: a smart hairbrush made by Withings that the company says will improve a user&#8217;s hair care routine and help the person avoid hair damage.","rendered":"\u003Cp\u003ENokia made a splash at CES 2017 with help from its smart home subsidiary Withings.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Finnish phone maker on Tuesday announced a few new devices that it says will help its Withings brand, which Nokia \u003Cspan class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"NOK\"\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\u003Cspan class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\"\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003Ca class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\u002Fcompany\u002Fnok\u002F\"\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003Cspan class=\"ticker\"\u003ENOK\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003Cspan class=\"change percent\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\n\t\t\t\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E acquired in May 2016 for an undisclosed sum, continue to compete in the smart devices market.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EChief among those announcements was the new Withings Home Plus, a smart HD camera that can not only record what&#8217;s happening in the home, but also receive notifications in the event of an unusual noise, monitor indoor air quality, and keep a watchful eye on a baby with its baby-monitoring feature.

He&#8217;s also pledged in past years to learn Mandarin Chinese, eat only meat from animals that he personally killed, and read a new book every other week.

For more about Facebook, watch: Here\u2019s Zuckerberg\u2019s full post via Facebook: Every year I take on a personal challenge to learn new things and grow outside of my work. In recent years, I&#8217;ve run 365 miles, built a simple AI for my home, read 25 books and learned Mandarin. My personal challenge for 2017 is to have visited and met people in every state in the US by the end of the year. I&#8217;ve spent significant time in many states already, so I&#8217;ll need to travel to about 30 states this year to complete this challenge. After a tumultuous last year, my hope for this challenge is to get out and talk to more people about how they&#8217;re living, working and thinking about the future. Priscilla and I have enjoyed taking road trips together since we started dating. Recently, I&#8217;ve traveled around the world and visited many cities, and now I&#8217;m excited to explore more of our country and meet more people here. Going into this challenge, it seems we are at a turning point in history. For decades, technology and globalization have made us more productive and connected. This has created many benefits, but for a lot of people it has also made life more challenging. This has contributed to a greater sense of division than I have felt in my lifetime. We need to find a way to change the game so it works for everyone. My work is about connecting the world and giving everyone a voice. I want to personally hear more of those voices this year. It will help me lead the work at Facebook and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative so we can make the most positive impact as the world enters an important new period.\u201d My trips this year will take different forms &#8212; road trips with Priscilla, stops in small towns and universities, visits to our offices across the country, meetings with teachers and scientists, and trips to fun places you recommend along the way. I&#8217;ve enjoyed doing these challenges with our community and I&#8217;ll post tomorrow about how everyone around the world can join in. I&#8217;m looking forward to this challenge and I hope to see you out there!","rendered":"\u003Cp\u003EMark Zuckerberg plans to do a lot of traveling in the New Year.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Facebook \u003Cspan class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"fb\"\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\u003Cspan class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\"\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003Ca class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ffortune.com\u002Ffortune500\u002Ffacebook-157\u002F\"\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003Cspan class=\"ticker\"\u003Efb\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003Cspan class=\"change percent\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\n\t\t\t\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E CEO and \u003Cem\u003EFortune\u2019s\u003C\u002Fem\u003E pick for 2016\u2019s \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ffortune.com\u002Ffacebook-mark-zuckerberg-business\u002F\"\u003EBusinessperson of the Year\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, said Tuesday that he \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.facebook.com\u002Fzuck\u002Fposts\u002F10103385178272401?notif_t=notify_me&amp;notif_id=1483479845570349\"\u003Eplans to visit\u003C\u002Fa\u003E roughly 30 states in 2017\u2014presumably ones where he&#8217;s never been before\u2014to achieve the goal of meeting with people in every U.S. state.

Rather Is Right, the Media Should Call Trump\u2019s Lies What They Are"},"content":{"plain":"What should the media do when the U.S. president says something that is clearly and unequivocally not true? This might have seemed like an academic ethical question in the past, but with business mogul Donald Trump set to move into the Oval Office soon, it has become much more pressing, and more than a little contentious. During a weekend interview on Meet the Press that included both New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet and Wall Street Journal editor Gerard Baker, the latter was asked whether he thought inaccurate statements by Trump should be specifically called out as lies. Baker said that he didn&#8217;t think so, because the word &#8220;lie&#8221; implies that the person told an untruth on purpose. Instead, the Journal editor argued that media outlets should simply present the facts and leave it up to readers to determine the truth. The word lie &#8220;implies much more than just saying something that&#8217;s false. It implies a deliberate intent to mislead,&#8221; Baker said. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s up to the reader to make up their own mind&#8230; If you start ascribing a moral intent, as it were, to someone by saying that they&#8217;ve lied, I think you run the risk that you look like you\u2019re not being objective.&#8221; Get Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter. Legendary news anchor Dan Rather, however, took issue with this approach in a post on his Facebook page that was widely shared among journalists. Rather called Baker&#8217;s argument &#8220;deeply disturbing.&#8221; It is not the proper role of journalists, the former anchor said, &#8220;to meet lies \u2014 especially from someone of Mr. Trump\u2019s stature and power \u2014 by hiding behind semantics and euphemisms. Our role is to call it as we see it, based on solid reporting. When something is, in fact, a demonstrable lie, it is our responsibility to say so.&#8221; In his NBC interview, Baker referred to Trump&#8217;s repeated statements that Muslims were seen cheering in New Jersey when the World Trade Center towers fell. The Journal reported that there was no evidence this had actually occurred, Baker said, and then left it to the reader to decide. But even if the standard principle is that something can only be called a lie if we know the intent of the speaker\u2014as the Journal editor argues it should be\u2014can we not assume that Trump was making those statements with a deliberate intent to mislead voters about Muslim behavior? After all, he said it multiple times, even after it had been proven false. The same thing goes for many other Trump statements on a wide range of issues. He has repeatedly said that millions of people voted illegally, which isn&#8217;t true, and that ending the &#8220;stop and frisk&#8221; campaign in New York increased crime, which it didn&#8217;t. There are literally hundreds of such examples. At what point does repeating them stop being a falsehood and become an outright lie? In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally &mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2016 Baker&#8217;s argument is very similar to the one made by moderators like Fox News host Chris Wallace and MSNBC host Chris Matthews during the presidential debates. Wallace said he didn&#8217;t think it was a moderator&#8217;s job to be a &#8220;truth squad,&#8221; while Matthews said calling out lies would be equivalent to expressing an opinion, which journalists shouldn&#8217;t do. Those comments came up in large part because Matt Lauer of NBC was widely criticized for failing to challenge Trump during an interview when the candidate claimed that he never supported the war in Iraq, despite abundant evidence to the contrary. In a Twitter debate on Monday with a number of journalists, including Fusion writer Felix Salmon and former New York Observer editor Elizabeth Spiers, Time Inc.&#8217;s chief content officer Alan Murray (who is also editor of this magazine) defended Baker&#8217;s approach, saying journalists should be careful about using the word &#8220;lie&#8221; without proof that the speaker deliberately intended to mislead. Words matter. &quot;False&quot; and &quot;lie&quot; are not the same thing. https:\u002F\u002Ft.co\u002FACM5exCej2 &mdash; Alan Murray (@alansmurray) January 3, 2017 Spiers and others, however, said journalists make intelligent inferences about a politician&#8217;s motives all the time, and catching one in a lie is no different. Former Fortune writer Dan Primack, who is now with the media startup Axios, said: &#8220;I agree about being careful. But if you can prove the shoe fits, then put it on.&#8221; Washington Post writer Greg Sargent argued that &#8220;Donald Trump lies. A lot. And news organizations should say so.&#8221; These are all of Trump&#8217;s potential conflicts of interest: Inaccurate statements aren&#8217;t always lies. As Murray pointed out, Ronald Reagan said a lot of things that turned out not to be true, but not all of them were lies. But he didn&#8217;t repeatedly tell the same untruths over and over in the face of all the available evidence, the way Trump has done throughout his campaign, behavior he will presumably continue once he is in office.

Almost immediately, digital security experts panned the story, criticizing it as prematurely alarmist and lacking key details. The supposed discovery linked &#8220;code&#8221; found on the utility&#8217;s computer network to Russian election meddlers, who were widely believed to be Kremlin-sponsored and associated with state security and intelligence agencies such as the FSB and GRU. The finding came a day after the government published an intelligence report, criticized by many as overly broad, claiming to contain evidence of a Moscow-backed election interference campaign dubbed &#8220;Grizzly Steppe.&#8221; Soon after the initial Post story appeared, Burlington Electric came forward as the reportedly hacked organization. The municipally-owned utility clarified that had it had &#8220;detected the malware&#8221; on a single laptop, separate from its grid systems. In other words, the main premise of the Post story\u2014indeed, its headline\u2014turned out to be incorrect. The breach involved a solitary laptop and no penetration of the grid, the Post said in an editor&#8217;s note appended Saturday. Get Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter. A day later, Burlington Electric revealed more information about the incident, debunking suspicions. The code presumably associated with the Russian hacking operation turned out to be nothing more than a &#8220;specific type of Internet traffic&#8221; that had &#8220;been observed elsewhere in the country and is not unique to Burlington Electric,&#8221; the utility said in a second press release. The code in question was not a malicious software program, as some people suspected, but rather the appearance of a certain Internet connection. In a follow-up story published Monday evening, a different set of Post reporters\u2014citing more unnamed officials\u2014revealed that a security alert at Burlington Electric had tripped when an employee accessed a Yahoo yhoo email account. The alerts had been put in place after the Department of Homeland Security issued an industry-wide warning to the nation&#8217;s utilities, pointing to certain IP addresses contained in its &#8220;Grizzly Steppe&#8221; report, jointly produced with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The second Post story also reported that investigators later discovered malicious software on the Burlington Electric employee&#8217;s laptop. This was a common malware program called Neutrino that&#8217;s commonly deployed through online advertising networks, and likely unrelated to the Russian campaign &#8220;Grizzly Steppe.&#8221; For more on cybersecurity, watch: Before the investigators who were responding to Burlington Electric&#8217;s findings could suss out what really happened within the utility&#8217;s computer network, U.S. officials had apparently tipped the Post to an incomplete version of the news. It&#8217;s unclear whether the U.S. officials relayed inaccurate information, whether the reporters made false assumptions, or a combination. Then, the report spread like a computer worm. The dubious attribution to Russian hackers in the Burlington Electric incident\u2014specifically, to Russian hackers associated with U.S. election mischief\u2014arose because the utility had detected Internet connections that seemed to be linked to &#8220;Grizzly Steppe,&#8221; per the government&#8217;s report, despite the intelligence containing a range of IP addresses not exclusive to that hacking campaign. Indeed, a significant chunk of the IP addresses listed in the joint report mapped to ordinary proxy servers that privacy advocates, digital attackers, and others use to mask their tracks, as analyses of the set have showed. Cybersecurity experts who had pored over the White House-mandated &#8220;Grizzly Steppe&#8221; report, expecting to find revelations about the tactics of Russian election hackers, were disappointed to discover that the paper contained little actionable information. For security teams looking to find and block Russian malware, the data was &#8220;nearly useless,&#8221; as one expert, Robert Lee, founder of Dragos Security, put it in a widely read critique. Poor threat intelligence of this sort can be a costly distraction for resource-strapped security teams. The Washington Post Is Hiring Reporters, Bucking the Media Trend Burlington Electric, for its part, lamented the leaky lips of federal investigators when the organization was just trying to follow proper protocols in reporting the potential threat. &#8220;It\u2019s unfortunate that an official or officials improperly shared inaccurate information with one media outlet, leading to multiple inaccurate reports around the country,&#8221; said Mike Kanarick, communications director for the utility, in a statement. &#8220;Media reports stating that Burlington Electric was hacked or that the electric grid was breached are false,&#8221; he added. Quite a ruckus for a false alarm.","rendered":"\u003Cp\u003EA \u003Cem\u003EWashington Post\u003C\u002Fem\u003E report on Friday said that Russian hackers had \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.washingtonpost.com\u002Fworld\u002Fnational-security\u002Frussian-hackers-penetrated-us-electricity-grid-through-a-utility-in-vermont\u002F2016\u002F12\u002F30\u002F8fc90cc4-ceec-11e6-b8a2-8c2a61b0436f_story.html\"\u003Ebreached the nation&#8217;s power grid\u003C\u002Fa\u003E via a utility in Vermont, citing unnamed U.S. officials.

The new Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 mobile processor, shown off at the CES consumer electronics show in Las Vegas, will be the company&#8217;s high-end chip for smartphones, virtual-reality headsets, and mobile computers. It is smaller than Qualcomm&#8217;s previous chips, more power efficient, and provides faster Internet connectivity over mobile networks, according to the company. While Qualcomm QCOM didn&#8217;t say which high-end smartphones or tablets might support its new processor, the company did say it will be compatible with Google&#8217;s Android and Microsoft&#8217;s Windows operating systems. It also will be used in some upcoming smartglasses, which were previously announced by hardware maker Osterhout Design Group (ODG) and are targeted to consumers. Smartglasses are an emerging device category with companies like Microsoft and Google jumping into the fray.

Get Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter ODG company is working on two smartglasses ,to be shipped by July, that use both virtual reality and augmented reality technology. ODG said in a statement accompanying the Snapdragon 835 announcement that the processor would help those smartglasses deliver better visuals and enhanced performance. Additionally, Qualcomm said that its processors and LTE modems would be embedded in some Volkswagen cars so they can connect to cellular networks. The first set of Volkswagen vehicles running its Snapdragon 820A processor will start hitting the road in 2019, and those using its other new chips, like the X12 and X5 LTE, will be available in 2018. For more about Qualcomm, watch: Also, Qualcomm said that it planned to offer high-speed, Gigabit LTE chips for connected cars so they can access the Internet. The LTE chip, which can reach speeds of 1 gigabit per second, or speeds that are dramatically faster than most home Internet connections, will be available to car manufacturers in the first half of 2017. Chipmakers like Qualcomm and Intel see big opportunities in the connected car market. An increasing number of cars use wireless connections to automatically provide performance information to their manufacturers to help with repairs and upgrades. Connections can also be used to get drivers and their passengers onto the Internet over wireless networks. Looking ahead, Internet connectivity could prove to be critical for self-driving cars, which must quickly see what other cars are doing and respond accordingly.","rendered":"\u003Cp\u003EQualcomm unveiled several new chips on Tuesday that are mostly focused on what it believes are fast-growth areas.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe new Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 mobile processor, shown off at the CES consumer electronics show in Las Vegas, will be the company&#8217;s high-end chip for smartphones, virtual-reality headsets, and mobile computers.

Tech Titans, Pressured By Trump, Create More U.S. Factory Jobs?"},"content":{"plain":"A surprise move by Ford on Tuesday to kill a planned $1.6 billion auto plant in Mexico and move that work instead to Michigan may be a sign that business leaders have listened to President-elect Donald Trump, who has blasted U.S. companies for shipping jobs overseas. A big question is whether tech giants like Apple, IBM and Microsoft, all of whom rely heavily on foreign manufacturers, will follow Ford&#8217;s f lead. To be fair, while Trump tends to take credit for saving all these jobs\u2014he had threatened Ford with a 35% tariff on Mexican-built vehicles sold in the U.S.\u2014 Ford chief executive Mark Fields told CNN that the company &#8220;didn&#8217;t cut a deal with Trump. We did it for our business.&#8221; Whether you believe Ford&#8217;s move was due to Trump himself, or to a growing belief among voters that the country needs to maintain its own manufacturing capabilities, or that it just makes financial sense, as Fields argued, it is noteworthy. Last month, telecommunications company Sprint and satellite provider OneWeb announced plans to hire 5,000 U.S. workers. Although Trump claimed credit for those jobs, they were, in fact, part of a planned $50 billion U.S. investment by SoftBank Group founder Masayoshi Son before Trump&#8217;s election victory. SoftBank owns stakes in both Sprint and OneWeb. About 3,000 of those jobs would be at a new Florida factory where OneWeb says it will build low-cost satellites. It was unclear how many of the other jobs would be in manufacturing, but the fact that two tech companies committed so publicly to investing in American workers was noteworthy. And it was also great public relations since SoftBank also wants to revive a Sprint s merger with T-Mobile tmus that was proposed in 2014 but dropped in the face of U.S. regulatory resistance. SoftBank\u002FSprint might have better luck getting approval of the deal in a Trump administration. Apple, criticized by Trump in the past for its outsourced manufacturing, is a bellwether for tech stalwarts. Apple aapl has talked with Foxconn and Pegatron, two Asian contract manufacturers that build iPhones, to move some of their work stateside, according to unconfirmed reports. Furthermore, Apple CEO Tim Cook, along with his Microsoft and IBM counterparts Satya Nadella and Ginni Rometty respectively, attended Trump&#8217;s tech summit in New York last month. Creating U.S. jobs was one hot topic of the event. In an emailed statement, an Apple spokesman said the company: is responsible for creating more than two million jobs across the United States, from engineers, retail and call center employees to operations and delivery drivers. We work with over 8,000 suppliers from coast to coast and are investing heavily in American jobs and innovation. Get Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter. In a blog posted the day after the election, Microsoft president Brad Smith pointed out the need for more highly educated workers. He cited research showing that the U.S. economy added 35 million jobs over the last 25 years, but that the number of jobs held by those without a high school diploma fell 13% to 7.3 million while jobs for those with four-year degrees doubled. He stressed the need for private-public sector collaboration to boost jobs and innovation in the U.S. and elsewhere. But Smith made no mention of whether the company Microsoft would start making its Surface tablet devices in the U.S. or push its Asian manufacturing partners to open facilities here. For more on Ford&#8217;s factory move, watch: IBM&#8217;s Rometty, likewise, stated a need for companies to work with the U.S. government to improve the climate for job creation. In an open letter to Trump in November, she spoke about a need to train people for skilled jobs that don&#8217;t require two- or four-year college degrees. But again, there was little in the way of specifics and no mention of moving any services or manufacturing work to the U.S. from elsewhere. Fortune contacted Microsoft msft and IBM ibm for comment about their U.S. job plans and will update this article as needed. Toni Sacconaghi, senior research analyst with Bernstein Research said he hasn&#8217;t heard much from tech players about bringing jobs\u2014manufacturing or otherwise\u2014to the U.S. from abroad. And, Rometty&#8217;s plans, as spelled out in her letter, are &#8220;tough to interpret,&#8221; he said in an email. Thus far, SoftBank affiliates Sprint and OneWeb seem to be the only tech companies that have promised specific action on the domestic jobs front in the near term. The rest of the tech community has remained silent, at least publicly, about bringing manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. But then again, it&#8217;s early. One thing is certain, says Jeff Matthews, managing partner for RAM Partners, a Naples, Florida-based hedge fund, via email: &#8220;Every company I talk to is thinking about how to do more in America.

It&#8217;s not clear what NBCUniversal will be paying her, but she was reportedly making $15 million a year at Fox. Despite her disagreement with Trump\u2014and a few tense exchanges with host Bill O&#8217;Reilly after she said she was sexually harassed by former Fox chairman Roger Ailes\u2014there&#8217;s no question that Kelly has been a key player at the conservative-leaning network.

All that said, however, Kelly also has a reputation for promoting right-wing views on a variety of topics, including race. For example, she talked about an alleged plan by President Obama to force white neighborhoods to diversify, and also repeatedly criticized the Black Lives Matter movement, casting doubt on whether police shootings had anything to do with race. Kelly has also made critical comments about gay and transgender issues on a number of occasions, according to the left-leaning media watchdog group Media Matters, and has repeatedly hosted anti-gay groups such as the Family Research Council, which believes that homosexuality is a sin and that gay men routinely recruit children to be homosexual. congrats to NBC on hiring on a woman who made a name for herself through blithe, insidious racism https:\u002F\u002Ft.co\u002F7FbJu0PD1S pic.twitter.com\u002F7UegCoLz7x &mdash; Ashley Feinberg (@ashleyfeinberg) January 3, 2017 The Fox anchor also spent a considerable amount of time on her show pushing the idea that the Obama administration was somehow involved in voter intimidation efforts in 2008 involving a group called the New Black Panther Party, despite a conspicuous lack of evidence to that effect. On a network like Fox News, Kelly might have appeared to be a moderate voice, especially after she stood up to Trump&#8217;s repeated public bullying. But she is clearly a leading voice for right-wing viewpoints, which is why Fox reportedly offered her $20 million a year to stay. These are all of Trump&#8217;s potential conflicts of interest: And Kelly isn&#8217;t the only conservative voice making the move from Fox fox to NBCUniversal cmcsa .

For a network like NBC, embracing right-wing views by hiring and promoting hosts like Kelly may seem like a pragmatic move given what Trump&#8217;s election appears to say about the stance that many U.S. voters take on a number of issues.

But Arnold Schwarzenegger&#8217;s hosting debut wasn&#8217;t enough to give the network a ratings win for the show&#8217;s premiere. The latest iteration of Comcast-owned NBC&#8217;s Apprentice reality TV franchise\u2014which featured now president-elect Donald Trump as host for more than a decade\u2014lost the ratings battle with rival networks ABC and CBS cbs during the 8 p.m. ET primetime slot on Monday night. With Schwarzenegger now in the hosting chair, The New Celebrity Apprentice averaged roughly 4.9 million total viewers across its two-hour premiere, according to Nielsen&#8217;s tracking numbers. ABC&#8217;s two-hour The Bachelor premiere pulled in nearly 6.6 million viewers by comparison, while CBS averaged more than 6 million viewers between four half-hour sitcoms that aired between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. While NBC heavily promoted Schwarzenegger&#8217;s Apprentice takeover ahead of the show&#8217;s January debut, the movie star and former California governor&#8217;s reality TV turn got off to a mediocre start, especially when compared with the ratings of his predecessor. The ratings for last night&#8217;s Celebrity Apprentice premiere were down more than 22% from the debut episode of Trump&#8217;s most recent season hosting (2014-2015). The show averaged 7.6 million nightly viewers in that season, and the ratings for the key demographic (viewers aged 18 to 49) across that season was roughly 46% higher than what Schwarzenegger&#8217;s debut scored on Monday. The network has been pushing the show&#8217;s new host and new season for months, including weathering last month&#8217;s controversy over the fact that president-elect Trump will continue receiving an executive producer credit on the show going forward. (As Fortune reported at the time, Trump has a large stake in the show that he co-created with fellow producer Mark Burnett, but will reportedly be compensated by MGM, which owns the majority stake in the production company that owns the rights to the Apprentice franchise.)

The London-based company unveiled the product \u2014 which is part of the ever-growing Internet of Things (making everyday objects smart and connected) \u2014 at CES 2017, the big tech trade show in Las Vegas this week. Smarter\u2019s FridgeCam is a wireless camera with an app that allows users to see the contents of their fridge from anywhere, receive reminders about expiration dates, and pick up groceries that are running low. Scheduled for release in the first quarter of 2017, the Smarter FridgeCam was designed to help address the global food waste crisis by notifying consumers of approaching expiration dates and suggesting ways to use foods before they go bad. Related: Tim Ferriss\u2019 Secret to Achieving a Breakthrough? Ask Absurd Questions. Additional features include alerts when the refrigerator temperature ventures outside the ideal range, notifications when food items are removed from the fridge, and auto-replenish ordering via the user\u2019s preferred online grocer. Geo-location reminders will alert the user when a grocery store is nearby, so milk, eggs, or other essentials can be purchased. The Smarter FridgeCam will sell for $150. Christian Lane, creator of Smarter, launched his first company at 19 with the backing of investors from Dragon\u2019s Den, the U.K. version of Shark Tank. Christian launched Smarter in 2013, with the goal of making people\u2019s lives easier through connected technology. He is the recipient of 2015 Great Britain Young Entrepreneur of the Year, London Design Awards, and other accolades for his IoT contributions. \u201cWe are very excited to showcase our FridgeCam with its full range of functions for the first time anywhere in the world,\u201d Lane said in a statement. \u201cWe created the FridgeCam to not only save people money, time, and energy, but also tackle food waste head-on in the process. In the U.S., average households can waste anywhere between $1,365 to $2,275 of food every year.\u201d Smarter\u2019s other products, the iKettle and Smarter Coffee Maker, are sold in more than 1,000 stores in the U.K. and Europe. By the end of 2017, Smarter expects to become a global connected platform that connects consumers to their kitchens, making grocery shopping and food waste a thing of the past. Smarter is self-funded and it has 20 employees. This article originally appeared on VentureBeat.

Tech Titans, Pressured By Trump, Create More U.S. Factory Jobs?"},"content":{"plain":"A surprise move by Ford on Tuesday to kill a planned $1.6 billion auto plant in Mexico and move that work instead to Michigan may be a sign that business leaders have listened to President-elect Donald Trump, who has blasted U.S. companies for shipping jobs overseas. A big question is whether tech giants like Apple, IBM and Microsoft, all of whom rely heavily on foreign manufacturers, will follow Ford&#8217;s f lead. To be fair, while Trump tends to take credit for saving all these jobs\u2014he had threatened Ford with a 35% tariff on Mexican-built vehicles sold in the U.S.\u2014 Ford chief executive Mark Fields told CNN that the company &#8220;didn&#8217;t cut a deal with Trump. We did it for our business.&#8221; Whether you believe Ford&#8217;s move was due to Trump himself, or to a growing belief among voters that the country needs to maintain its own manufacturing capabilities, or that it just makes financial sense, as Fields argued, it is noteworthy. Last month, telecommunications company Sprint and satellite provider OneWeb announced plans to hire 5,000 U.S. workers. Although Trump claimed credit for those jobs, they were, in fact, part of a planned $50 billion U.S. investment by SoftBank Group founder Masayoshi Son before Trump&#8217;s election victory. SoftBank owns stakes in both Sprint and OneWeb. About 3,000 of those jobs would be at a new Florida factory where OneWeb says it will build low-cost satellites. It was unclear how many of the other jobs would be in manufacturing, but the fact that two tech companies committed so publicly to investing in American workers was noteworthy. And it was also great public relations since SoftBank also wants to revive a Sprint s merger with T-Mobile tmus that was proposed in 2014 but dropped in the face of U.S. regulatory resistance. SoftBank\u002FSprint might have better luck getting approval of the deal in a Trump administration. Apple, criticized by Trump in the past for its outsourced manufacturing, is a bellwether for tech stalwarts. Apple aapl has talked with Foxconn and Pegatron, two Asian contract manufacturers that build iPhones, to move some of their work stateside, according to unconfirmed reports. Furthermore, Apple CEO Tim Cook, along with his Microsoft and IBM counterparts Satya Nadella and Ginni Rometty respectively, attended Trump&#8217;s tech summit in New York last month. Creating U.S. jobs was one hot topic of the event. In an emailed statement, an Apple spokesman said the company: is responsible for creating more than two million jobs across the United States, from engineers, retail and call center employees to operations and delivery drivers. We work with over 8,000 suppliers from coast to coast and are investing heavily in American jobs and innovation. Get Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter. In a blog posted the day after the election, Microsoft president Brad Smith pointed out the need for more highly educated workers. He cited research showing that the U.S. economy added 35 million jobs over the last 25 years, but that the number of jobs held by those without a high school diploma fell 13% to 7.3 million while jobs for those with four-year degrees doubled. He stressed the need for private-public sector collaboration to boost jobs and innovation in the U.S. and elsewhere. But Smith made no mention of whether the company Microsoft would start making its Surface tablet devices in the U.S. or push its Asian manufacturing partners to open facilities here. For more on Ford&#8217;s factory move, watch: IBM&#8217;s Rometty, likewise, stated a need for companies to work with the U.S. government to improve the climate for job creation. In an open letter to Trump in November, she spoke about a need to train people for skilled jobs that don&#8217;t require two- or four-year college degrees. But again, there was little in the way of specifics and no mention of moving any services or manufacturing work to the U.S. from elsewhere. Fortune contacted Microsoft msft and IBM ibm for comment about their U.S. job plans and will update this article as needed. Toni Sacconaghi, senior research analyst with Bernstein Research said he hasn&#8217;t heard much from tech players about bringing jobs\u2014manufacturing or otherwise\u2014to the U.S. from abroad. And, Rometty&#8217;s plans, as spelled out in her letter, are &#8220;tough to interpret,&#8221; he said in an email. Thus far, SoftBank affiliates Sprint and OneWeb seem to be the only tech companies that have promised specific action on the domestic jobs front in the near term. The rest of the tech community has remained silent, at least publicly, about bringing manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. But then again, it&#8217;s early. One thing is certain, says Jeff Matthews, managing partner for RAM Partners, a Naples, Florida-based hedge fund, via email: &#8220;Every company I talk to is thinking about how to do more in America. I&#8217;m not sure that they will, but it is now something that&#8217;s on everybody&#8217;s radar, which can&#8217;t hurt.&#8221;","rendered":"\u003Cp\u003EA surprise move by Ford on Tuesday \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ffortune.com\u002F2017\u002F01\u002F03\u002Fford-cancels-mexico-plant-trump\u002F\"\u003Eto kill a planned $1.6 billion auto plant\u003C\u002Fa\u003E in Mexico and move that work instead to Michigan may be a sign that business leaders have listened to President-elect Donald Trump, who has blasted U.S. companies for shipping jobs overseas.

Intel joins HERE&#8217;s current owners\u2014carmakers Audi, BMW, and Daimler\u2014in their efforts to build a vast global map and location database that doesn&#8217;t rely on information from Apple aapl or Google. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich has targeted making chips and sensors for self-driving cars, automated robots, and AI-enhanced drones as one of the company&#8217;s new growth market. The carmakers bought HERE from Nokia in 2015 for $3 billion. Intel intc declined to disclose how much it paid for its 15% stake. Get Data Sheet, Fortune&#8217;s technology newsletter. &#8220;Cars are rapidly becoming some of the world\u2019s most intelligent, connected devices,&#8221; Krzanich said in a statement. &#8220;We look forward to working with HERE and its automotive partners to deliver an important technology foundation for smart and connected cars of the future.&#8221; Intel&#8217;s aim is to help the car makers create much more robust and detailed mapping hardware and software that will be needed for truly autonomous vehicles. HERE&#8217;s next generation mapping applications will be able to pinpoint a car&#8217;s location within centimeters, down from exactness in meters today, the company says. HERE&#8217;s current product offerings run the gamut from a consumer-oriented smartphone app called HERE WeGo to live traffic data that can be licensed and fed into car navigation systems, all built on top of its ecosystem of mapping data and related software tools. The head of Intel&#8217;s automated driving group, Doug Davis, will join HERE&#8217;s supervisory board after the transaction is completed. The deal is expected to close before the end of the first quarter. Google googl has long dominated the market for digitally usable map and location data for portable devices, after it spent billions building its data sets. Apple had to play catch up after it created its own smartphone map app in 2012, relying on licensing data from Dutch provider TomTom.

We\u2019ve compiled some of our favorite pieces of career advice published in 2016: Sarah Kauss, founder and CEO of S\u2019well: Delegation can sometimes come off as negative\u2014like you\u2019re just pushing off work on someone else\u2014but it doesn\u2019t have to be perceived that way. Don\u2019t just say \u201cno\u201d to a request. You should, in fact, pass it along when you\u2019re too busy. And that\u2019s not a bad thing. Think of the opportunity you are giving others. A conference organizer may not always want your senior vice president when the founder or CEO can\u2019t make the event. But if you show that you trust someone else with an opportunity\u200a\u2014\u200asuch as establishing your company\u2019s brand reputation\u200a\u2014\u200ayou may be surprised by the positive reactions you\u2019ll receive. Dennis Yang, CEO of Udemy: Hiring begins with the job description itself, which needs to reflect the position\u2019s real requirements and responsibilities. Too many companies go forth in search of a left-handed, purple unicorn: that elusive individual who possesses mastery in a broad range of skills and can single-handedly do the job of many people. Unfortunately, unicorns don\u2019t exist. Companies that think they\u2019ve hired one stand to be disappointed, and candidates who represent themselves as such are either on the fast track to burnout or are overselling themselves. Your job listings need to be realistic in order to attract real candidates and give your interviewers tangible evaluation criteria. Amber Theorharis, host for the NFL Network: When [a] job opens, take it\u2014even if the salary is low. Success doesn\u2019t happen overnight, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with starting at the bottom. That\u2019s where you make mistakes that will be the least devastating to your professional reputation\u2014and you can still learn from them. The money and the position will come later, but you have to get in the game. Take a side job to pay the bills if your career can\u2019t. I waited tables after work and on weekends for almost two years while working on-air at a small TV station in Salisbury, Md. My dream was bigger than my pride. &nbsp; Jeremy Roche, president and CEO of FinancialForce: I can\u2019t express enough how important it is to throw your ego out the door. When you jump into a new career or position, there is a 100% chance you will make mistakes. No matter how much experience you have and how high up the ranks you were, when you start a new job, you will have to prove yourself all over again. And while that might sound daunting, you have to stay positive. Embrace the unknown and be willing to go back to the basics of learning new skills. This experience can build empathy, truly enhancing your leadership skills in the long run. Kim Metcalf-Kupres, vice president and chief marketing officer of Johnson Controls: Fight for change when it matters and learn to let lesser issues roll off. While gender parity continues to improve in traditionally male-dominated fields, the reality is that we all have preconceived perceptions of how things should be, and culture change does not happen overnight. In these moments, especially if they involve unconscious bias, it is essential to educate others and provide your perspective in a kind and respectful manner. Don\u2019t sweat the small stuff.","rendered":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EEvery day at Fortune, influential leaders, entrepreneurs, and Fortune 500 executives offer valuable insight from their experiences navigating the business world.

Fortune 500\u2019s 7 Best-Performing Stocks of 2016"},"content":{"plain":"For 2016\u2019s best-performing Fortune 500 stocks, you can definitely call it a comeback. In a year when the S&amp;P 500 has gained a solid 10%, these Fortune 500 companies ran circles around that return: All of the stocks on this list at least doubled their share prices in 2016, and the top two winners each more than quadrupled. Still, you won\u2019t find any high-growth tech companies on this list. Most of this year&#8217;s big winners come from unsexy industries beset by struggles from which these firms are just starting to emerge. Three are steel companies whose stocks took off after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election, prompting hopes of a wave of new spending on infrastructure. Also, although Fortune 500 members are, by definition, the largest companies in the U.S. by revenue, none of this year&#8217;s top gainers was among the very biggest of the big. Indeed, six of the top 10 performers come from the bottom half of the 500 list. Even though they may no longer be underdogs, the stocks of many of 2016\u2019s best performers remain well below their all-time highs, and several still look cheap. So even if you missed out on a four-bagger return this year, there may be more rallies to come for some of these stocks in 2017. Here&#8217;s the full list of 2016\u2019s biggest Fortune 500 stock winners. 1. AK Steel Holding Fortune 500 rank: No. 383 2016 return: 359% Courtesy of AK Steel Holding Iron ore and steel prices fell precipitously in 2015 on slowing demand for construction material in China. But they bounced back forcefully after hitting bottom in early 2016, as steel producers cut production dramatically. After several years of losses, AK Steel aks is expected to turn a profit in 2016, as the company continued to cut costs while also benefiting from higher prices. Still, the steepest jump in AK Steel\u2019s stock price came after Trump won the election: AK\u2019s shares are up more than 74% since Nov. 8. Not only is the Trump administration likely to green-light more infrastructure projects that will rely on heavy materials such as steel, the President-elect has signaled that he will enact trade policies that make imported steel less attractive while tipping the scales toward U.S. producers. Oh, and it doesn\u2019t hurt that Trump\u2019s nominee for secretary of commerce is Wilbur Ross, the founder and former CEO of a major steel company. \u201cTrump\u2019s impact on trade and therefore domestic steel supply and prices could be much quicker and more meaningful than Trump\u2019s infrastructure plans,\u201d write J.P. Morgan analysts, who rate AK Steel &#8220;overweight&#8221; (that is, a buy). 2.United States Steel Fortune 500 rank: No. 244 2016 return: 332% Courtesy of United States Steel Like AK Steel&#8217;s shares, United States Steel x stock surged this year as steel prices rose, then accelerated further after Trump\u2019s victory (gaining more than 70% since the election). U.S. Steel doesn\u2019t have quite as much leeway to cut costs as smaller peers like AK. That makes it extremely sensitive to steel prices\u2014and also makes it the American steel stock that could benefit the most from a recovery in that market, according to J.P. Morgan. As the amount of steel imported from China continues to decline and domestic production stays in check, the price of the metal will likely keep going up\u2014sending U.S. Steel even higher. 3. Navistar International Fortune 500 rank: No. 281 2016 return: 236% Mahindra Navistar trucks at a factory in Maharashtra, India.(Kuni Takahashi\u002FBloomberg) This year\u2019s rally in Navistar\u2019s stock\u2014which more than tripled in 2016\u2014has almost (but not quite) made up for its terrible 2015, when the shares fell 74%. Navistar nav , which makes diesel engines and trucks, took a costly wrong turn a few years ago when it tried and failed to develop its own emissions-reducing system to meet new Environmental Protection Agency standards. In March, it had to pay $7.5 million to settle Securities and Exchange Commission charges that it misled shareholders about its technology\u2019s capability to cut emissions. While the end of that investigation popped the lid off Navistar\u2019s stock price, the tipping point came just after Labor Day, when Volkswagen\u2014a company that faced its own (much larger) emissions scandal\u2014announced it was taking a nearly 17% stake in the company. Navistar\u2019s shares surged 41% in a single day on the news. Other investors in the company include high-profile activist Carl Icahn. 4. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Fortune 500 rank: No. 16 (Fannie Mae) and No. 43 (Freddie Mac) 2016 return: 140% (Fannie Mae) and 136% (Freddie Mac) Fannie Mae headquarters in Washington, D.C.Photograph by Kevin Lamarque \u2014 Reuters We&#8217;ve lumped these two stocks together here because their businesses, their recent stock performance and their near-term outlooks are close to identical. Prior to the presidential election, Fannie&#8217;s and Freddie\u2019s share prices were pretty much flat for 2016. But that all changed when Trump won the White House: Both Fannie Mae fnma and Freddie Mac fmcc stock have more than doubled since the Nov. 8 vote. The reason is fairly straightforward: Trump\u2019s treasury secretary pick, former Goldman Sachs banker Steven Mnuchin, suggested privatizing Fannie and Freddie, which have been under government control since the mortgage lenders received a giant bailout during the financial crisis. That outcome would be a far cry from what was expected just a few years ago, when Fannie and Freddie\u2019s shares were worth just pennies as the government indicated that it would eventually phase them out entirely. Privatizing the quasi-governmental companies would also a huge boon to a growing contingent of hedge fund speculators, who have invested in the pair and advocated that the government allow the companies to keep more of their own profits. One indication of Fannie and Freddie\u2019s wild ride since the Great Recession? They were the top two best-performing Fortune 500 stocks in 2013, returning more than 1000% each, only to land on the list of worst performers the following year. 5.Oneok Fortune 500 rank: No. 348 2016 return: 135.6% Courtesy of Oneok An Oklahoma-based natural gas production and pipeline company, Oneok oke struggled when that commodity\u2019s price fell along with oil prices starting a couple of years ago: Oneok stock was down 46% in 2015. But as natural gas prices surged this year, Oneok\u2019s shares more than doubled. Still, they have yet to recover to where they were trading at their peak in the summer of 2014. 6. Freeport-McMoRan Fortune 500 rank: No. 175 2016 return: 106% Copper-gold concentrate from Freeport McMoRan Inc.&#8217;s Grasberg copper and gold mine is loaded onto a ship in Amamapare, Papua province, Indonesia.Dadang Tri\u2014Bloomberg After a five-year bear market in precious metals including gold, silver and copper\u2014all of which Freeport-McMoRan fcx produces at its mines\u2014the prices of those commodities rallied in 2016 as supply came down closer in line with demand. Trump\u2019s election win gave copper an additional kick, with investors believing that his administration\u2019s expected infrastructure projects will need to rely on that building material. Freeport had suffered particularly in recent years from its decision to diversify into the oil business\u2014at what turned out to be exactly the wrong time, as prices plummeted. It sold off some of its energy business this year, relieving it of some of the debt it had taken on in the process. Still, Freeport maintains substantial operations in that area that will benefit if oil prices continue to rise. 7.Steel Dynamics Fortune 500 rank: No. 356 2016 return: 100% Courtesy of Steel Dynamics Unlike its fellow steelmakers on this list\u2014AK Steel and United States Steel\u2014Steel Dynamics stld managed to ride out steel&#8217;s 2015 price downturn relatively unscathed: Its stock price only shed about 7% last year. The company also stayed profitable, generating hefty free cash flow. Still, Steel Dynamics still got a major boost from rising prices this year. And it&#8217;s particularly well positioned to profit from increasing demand for steel, as the company has greatly expanded the amount it can produce since the 2008 financial crisis.","rendered":"\u003Cp\u003EFor 2016\u2019s best-performing \u003Cem\u003EFortune\u003C\u002Fem\u003E 500 stocks, you can definitely call it a comeback.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn a year when the S&amp;P 500 has gained a solid 10%, these \u003Cem\u003EFortune\u003C\u002Fem\u003E 500 companies ran circles around that return: All of the stocks on this list at least doubled their share prices in 2016, and the top two winners each more than quadrupled.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EStill, you won\u2019t find any high-growth tech companies on this list.

And unlike past picks, this one has no record of criticizing net neutrality, the 2015 rules that prevent Internet service providers from slowing or blocking online content and services. David Morken, co-founder of Republic Wireless and an entrepreneur from Raleigh, N.C., will join three prior Trump FCC transition team members in helping set policies at the agency that regulates telecommunications, cable TV, and the Internet, Politico reported on Thursday. But unlike previous Trump FCC transition picks, Morken has no obvious and widespread record of speaking out against the agency&#8217;s moves in 2015 to protect competition on the Internet through net neutrality rules. Companies like AT&amp;T t and Verizon have complained that the rules over-regulate the industry and deter investment in networks. Rather, Morken was quoted in the Wall Street Journal on Dec. 9 expressing concern about the tilt of some of the earlier picks. Get Data Sheet, Fortune&#8217;s technology newsletter. &#8220;Traditional Republican telecom policy has favored incumbents who are heavily engaged in regulatory capture over innovators like us,&#8221; Morken was quoted saying in article about Trump&#8217;s expected FCC policies to demolish regulations that protect smaller players. Morken told the paper he was a lifelong Republican, but in &#8220;every election I have to choose between voting personal conviction or business interests.&#8221; Fortune contacted Morken for comment and will update this story if we receive a response. Trump&#8217;s first three picks had ties to the largest companies in the telecom sector and had written publicly against the FCC&#8217;s rules on net neutrality. For more on the net neutrality battle, watch: Jeff Eisenach, an economist who has been on Verizon\u2019s vz payroll, and Mark Jamison, who formerly worked on Sprint\u2019s s lobbying team and now heads the University of Florida\u2019s Public Utility Research Center, opposed the net neutrality rules and other policies of the FCC under Obama appointee Tom Wheeler. A third appointee, Roslyn Layton is a telecom industry consultant and visiting fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who has opposed both net neutrality and Internet privacy rules. The two current Republican members of the FCC, Ajit Pai and Michael O&#8217;Rielly, have said rolling back the net neutrality rules will be a top priority next year.

Perhaps more importantly for those who insisted that AWS was a loss-leader for its parent company, the cloud unit reported profit of $1.02 billion for that period, at least if employee stock compensation is excluded. With that compensation factored in, profit was a still-healthy $821 million, up from $428 million from the year before. But 2017 will not be a walk in the park for Amazon amzn largely because at least some of those tech rivals mentioned above have gotten their acts together, building data centers worldwide, and investing heavily in their public cloud services. Microsoft msft , in particular, has been making progress, says Dave Bartoletti, principal analyst for Forrester Research forr . Microsoft Azure is now a strong number two in public cloud while Google goog , IBM ibm , and others battle it out for the number three slot, in his view. Get Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter. In the face of that heightened competition, Amazon must continue to appeal to its core base of developers at small companies, who started flocking to its services ten years ago, using credit cards to rent servers and storage, typically circumventing IT control. And it must now also woo those same IT people, as it seeks more big corporate business. That&#8217;s a fine line. In fact, it&#8217;s almost schizophrenic. Every year at the annual AWS Re:Invent conference, one day is dedicated to products geared for IT professionals who typically work to provision servers and storage, and maintain databases. Another day is all about cutting-edge and the latest trending tech, like tools for the Internet of things. Amazon has been very strategic\u2014and ambitious\u2014with new products for that IT demographic. Two of the hardest-to-dislodge technologies in big companies are Oracle databases and VMware virtualization software. It is very difficult to move customers off these deeply entrenched products, no matter how much the companies might like to do so. &#8220;Every year one goal for most companies is to reduce spending on Oracle and VMware, and every year IT comes back and say &#8216;we didn\u2019t do it.&#8217; That&#8217;s because to reduce spending on Oracle and VMware requires risk and money,&#8221; Bartoletti says. For the past few years, AWS has targeted Oracle with such products as a MySQL database clone and a database migration tool to automate the tricky process of moving on-premises Oracle (or Microsoft) databases to AWS. This year, it announced its own managed version of PostgreSQL. PostgreSQL, is seen as a more enterprise-ready, open-source database than MySQL, which Oracle owns. For more on AWS, watch And for all those petabytes of corporate data accumulating in company data centers over the decades? This year, AWS came out with an actual truck, dubbed Snowmobile, which it says can securely ship up to 100 petabytes of data from corporate server rooms to an AWS facility in one fell swoop. It seems like brute force\u2014and it is\u2014but face it, using even a high-speed network connection moving that amount of data would take forever. Amazon says Snowmobile will enable companies to move an exabyte (or 1,000 petabytes) of data to Amazon in six months or so. That same data transfer would take 20 years over a fast, 10Gbps dedicated connection, the company said. On the VMware vmw side, AWS and VMware are working together on VMware Cloud on AWS, due out in mid-2017. In theory, it will let VMware customers run their existing VMware operations directly on AWS servers. This was pitched as a win for joint customers and both AWS and VMware. But most cloud watchers suspect that many of those VMware users will end up moving their VMware workloads to AWS and then, over time, off of VMware altogether. Time will tell. But for those who think AWS has already won the public cloud wars, remember, it&#8217;s hard to maintain technology dominance over many generations. And also remember, that big Fortune 500 companies have barely put their toes in the water yet. Most estimates hold that 5% or 6% of big company workloads are in the public cloud at this point. That&#8217;s the tippy-top of an enormous ice berg. That leaves the other cloud providers\u2014at least those with big checkbooks\u2014with room to maneuver.","rendered":"\u003Cp\u003EOver the last decade, \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ffortune.com\u002Ffortune500\u002Famazoncom-18\u002F\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EAmazon\u003C\u002Fa\u003E Web Services has become the focal point of every tech company, most of which are now fighting to build their own public clouds.

Heavy Combat Between Cable and Wireless in 2017"},"content":{"plain":"For over a decade, AT&amp;T has been ramping up its television programming offerings. Last year&#8217;s $49 billion acquisition of satellite TV provider DirecTV, combined with the company&#8217;s U-verse cable offering, gave AT&amp;T the largest pay TV subscriber base in the industry \u2014though growing that audience much bigger has proven challenging. But in 2017, big cable is poised to strike back. Comcast and Charter Communications, the two largest cable TV companies, are promising to get into the mobile phone business, and things could interesting in a hurry. The cable companies say they will pitch a bundled service that includes TV, Internet, and mobile features. Bundling\u2014at the right price\u2014can lower the risk of customers defecting to one of the growing number of Internet-based video services. And instead of spending billions on airwave licenses, the cable companies have cut a deal with Verizon to lease wireless data and calling capacity. Get Data Sheet, Fortune&#8217;s technology newsletter. Starting in mid-2017, Comcast is planning to offer &#8220;an attractively-priced multi-product bundle&#8221; CEO Brian Roberts told analysts in October. Charter CEO Tom Rutledge seemed to be speaking from the same cue cards when he told analysts last month his company will be &#8220;offering an attractively priced product bundle&#8221; with an eye towards reducing customer churn. The economic key to the cable wireless services, however, will be the companies&#8217; vast networks of wifi routers deployed across their service territories. Using Verizon&#8217;s wireless capacity could get expensive, but piggybacking mobile customers on wifi signals is virtually cost-free. A few tiny carriers have sprung up trying to use such a hybrid approach to reduce costs, but Comcast cmcsa and Charter chtr will be operating on a vastly greater scale. Comcast, for its part, says it has 15 million hotspots deployed. The question remains just how many cable customers want to handcuff their wireless service to their broadband and television provider. Cable companies have long suffered from poor customer satisfaction ratings and convincing subscribers to sign up for a new hybrid form of mobile service could be difficult. For more on Comcast&#8217;s wireless plans, watch: In the past, the benefits of bundling haven&#8217;t been all that attractive, Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research says. &#8220;It\u2019s never really seemed to capture customers\u2019 attention, in part because it means two of your biggest monthly bills get combined and there\u2019s little benefit beyond maybe a $5 discount or something,&#8221; Dawson says. In theory, new, strong competition for AT&amp;T, Verizon vz , Sprint s , and T-Mobile tmus should bring down prices and improve features for consumers. But the cable companies may be more interested in preserving their existing businesses than in disrupting wireless, Dawson adds. &#8220;We\u2019ll see to what extent this is really about saving consumers money or providing other really meaningful benefits versus simple bundling,&#8221; he says. Previous cable efforts to get into wireless didn&#8217;t get very far. Comcast and other cable companies were early backers of upstart wireless firm Clearwire but dumped an agreement to resell service back in 2011 after almost no customers signed up. Clearwire ended up being acquired by Sprint shortly thereafter. Even before that, cable companies spent billions buying airwave rights in 2006 but most never offered any service and Verizon bought the licenses in 2011. Part of that deal included the leasing rights that Comcast and Charter will use next year when they enter the market. Even if they don&#8217;t win many customers, the cable incursion could wound the wireless industry in one important way, however. This year, the four big telecom carriers were among the best performing stocks in the market, led by Sprint&#8217;s 144% gain, as of December 29. T-Mobile was up 49%, AT&amp;T t rose 24% and Verizon added 16%. But just as the perception of cord cutting hurt some media stocks this summer out of proportion to its actual impact on financial results, the much hyped entry of cable into wireless could spook telecom investors. &#8220;We don\u2019t expect cable to have any significant impact on the wireless market until around 2020,&#8221; industry analyst Craig Moffett at MoffettNathanson Research wrote recently. &#8220;When they do enter the wireless space, however, it won\u2019t be good news for the incumbents.&#8221; How Taylor Swift Could Help AT&amp;T Win Over Cord Cutters Meanwhile, AT&amp;T is getting even more into TV and could dent the cable industry&#8217;s revenue with its new Internet-based video service called DirecTV Now. Offering more than 100 cable channels at a starting price of $35, the service is being pitched to the 20 million or so households that don&#8217;t currently pay for TV, so-called cord cutters and cord nevers. But it&#8217;s pretty easy to see how the low price could also prove alluring to regular cable customers tired of paying an average of over $100 per month for TV service. Still, cable has a solid strategy to fight back, according to analyst Moffett. Cable companies are the leading provider of broadband Internet service, which customers will still need, even after they decide to drop cable TV service for DirecTV Now or other, similar services. And by manipulative pricing of different bundles, cable companies have &#8220;a very powerful pricing counter-balance,&#8221; Moffett says. So expect a lot more headlines about cable versus wireless competition next year. But the actual impact on consumers&#8217; pocketbooks may be harder to discern.","rendered":"\u003Cp\u003EFor over a decade, \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ffortune.com\u002Ffortune500\u002Fatt-10\u002F\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EAT&amp;T\u003C\u002Fa\u003E has been ramping up its television programming offerings.

Now operating as part of the company Access in Alphabet&#8217;s &#8220;other bets&#8221; division, the fiber service has recently seen its CEO depart without being replaced, halted expansion in new cities, and laid off almost 10% of its staff. On Thursday, that convergence of factors prompted speculation by the tech news web site The Information that Google is likely getting ready to dispose of the service, which was a pioneer in bringing gigabit Internet download speeds to consumers.

A few months prior, the service had announced it was revamping its business model to use more wireless technology as it paused all planned expansions into brand new cities. Google is hardly the first company to run into cost issues while trying to provide consumer Internet and cable TV service, even before the era of high-speed fiber optic connections.

But famed short sellers at Citron Research say Nvidia&#8217;s stock is poised to fall about 20% after its big rally. Citron, which generally picks stocks its thinks will decline in value, says there are half a dozen problems ahead for Nvidia, mainly related to top competitors Intel and Advanced Micro Devices. While Nvidia has been touting its progress in cracking new markets like computer chips tuned for artificial intelligence, most of its success in 2016 came from gains in its traditional PC and gaming graphics chips, the firm said in a report on Wednesday. That could leave it more vulnerable to traditional competition than many investors expect, the firm wrote. Nvidia shares fell 5% in mid-day trading on Wednesday after the report was released. Get Data Sheet, Fortune&#8217;s technology newsletter. Citron, run by Andrew Left, is among the most prominent short sellers, or investors who bet stocks will decline in value. Last year, Left called Valeant Pharmaceuticals vrx as overvalued\u2014dubbing it the &#8220;pharmaceutical Enron&#8221;\u2014before its stock crashed. Nvidia&#8217;s 2016 stock rise came as its revenue and profit have skyrocketed. Last quarter, revenue rose 54% from the same period a year earlier to a record $2 billion while net income increased 120% to $542 million. But Citron said not much of the gain was from new markets, but rather from seizing larger market share in the gaming market from AMD. Such gains can&#8217;t continue at the same pace in the future, limiting potential growth. Nvidia nvda has also targeted selling more chips for large data center servers, but massive competition is coming in 2017 from new high performance chips from Intel intc and AMD amd , Citron noted. And some of the largest data center owners, like Google googl , are shifting to their own custom chips. Apple aapl could possibly do the same for graphics chips it buys from Nvidia, Citron said, though recent Mac models use AMD chips. For more on Intel&#8217;s plans, watch: Another problem could hit Nvidia&#8217;s profit margin as it competes more directly with Intel. Nvidia doesn&#8217;t own chip fabricating factories, as Intel does, and instead relies on outsourcing to manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing tsmc . That gives Intel greater pricing flexibility, which could put pressure on Nvidia, Citron wrote. Intel could reduce the price of its chips by 37% and still have an 80% margin. Also, a deal to license intellectual property to Intel is coming to end, which will cut off a highly lucrative royalty stream, Citron says. As fans of Amazon amzn and Netflix nflx found out in 2016, one year&#8217;s top performing stock is rarely a great bet for the subsequent year. For investors who made a killing in Nvidia this year, it may be wise to move on.","rendered":"\u003Cp\u003EShares of chipmaker Nvidia have gained 237% this year, making the company one of the best performing stocks of 2016.

But the company still has a lot riding on executing well next year. First and foremost, Microsoft, under Satya Nadella\u2014who stepped in as chief executive, replacing Ballmer about three years ago\u2014must prove it can do big acquisitions well. Microsoft&#8217;s record there is checkered following misfires with Nokia and aQuantive\u2014both purchases resulting in huge write-offs. That means all eyes will be on how the software giant does with its just completed $26 billion purchase of LinkedIn. There&#8217;s no shortage of opinions about where LinkedIn is weak. With a clunky interface, it incessantly nudges users to share information and interact with people they may or may not want to engage. Does anyone actually appreciate reminders to send holiday greetings to long-forgotten associates? But LinkedIn has strengths as well\u2014chief among them the sheer amount of information it holds. That&#8217;s a big data treasure trove Microsoft msft hopes to parlay to boost the prospects of its business-focused customer relationship management software (CRM), used by sales people to enter and track sales leads. LinkedIn, despite the interface and spammy tendencies, has data on some 467 million users worldwide. Microsoft hopes to parlay that data to grow its own business software portfolio. If you&#8217;re a sales person using Microsoft Dynamics CRM for sales management, it would be useful to automatically search for people with certain titles at top companies and automatically import them into your prospect list. That is why CRM leader Salesforce.com crm also wanted to acquire LinkedIn\u2014only to be outbid. Benioff, founder and chief executive of Salesforce.com even dusted off the &#8220;M&#8221; word in referring to Microsoft&#8217;s &#8220;monopolistic&#8221; tendencies. Most hadn&#8217;t thought of Microsoft in those terms since the early part of the century, when it was deemed a monopoly by a federal court judge, only to have that ruling over turned on a technicality. Since then, the advent of a resurging Apple aapl , along with Google googl , Amazon amzn Web Services (AWS), and Salesforce itself ended any illusion of Microsoft as overly huge and powerful. Benioff blasted the proposed Microsoft deal as anti-competitive, charging that Microsoft could keep software rivals from using that LinkedIn data. The purchase nonetheless passed muster with regulatory agencies although European regulators mandated that Microsoft must give outside social networks the same access to the Microsoft Graph and Microsoft Office plug-ins and programming interfaces that LinkedIn gets. Microsoft will need to add value to LinkedIn in part by improving the aforementioned interface\u2014which it has said is in the works\u2014but also monetize that LinkedIn data without alienating users with more spam. For more on Microsoft and LinkedIn, watch: Azure cloud is the other key area Microsoft must push hard in 2017 and no one doubts that it will do so. Forrester Research forr principal analyst Dave Bartoletti says the software giant has thus far executed very well in cloud with a huge investment, he noted. Very few other tech companies can &#8220;find&#8221; $5 or $6 billion to pour into cloud data centers, he added. Microsoft&#8217;s effort to make Azure, a massive stockpile of connected servers and storage running in data centers worldwide, a home to open-source software including the Linux operating system, formerly anathema to the Windows company, has also helped make the company&#8217;s cloud more attractive to developers outside the hard-core Windows world. Having said that, the company needs to demonstrate more Azure usage going forward. Azure is seen as the second largest public cloud, but a distant second to AWS. Microsoft claims huge cloud growth but the numbers it releases lump Azure in with other non-cloud software including Windows Server that run on premises. the world will likely not get a real look at how much money Azure generates until Microsoft breaks out that figure, and that probably won&#8217;t happen till the Azure numbers compare well with AWS revenue, which, for the most recent quarter, was $3.2 billion. Microsoft has a compelling story here if customers can run the same set of Microsoft software in their own server rooms that runs in Azure. That would mean that risk-averse companies like banks or pharmaceutical companies could keep some data and = software running on their own hardware, while tapping into Microsoft Azure data centers as needed for less sensitive work. That mix of private and public computing facilities is what is referred to in the tech industry as the hybrid cloud model. Get Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s daily technology newsletter. However, Microsoft can&#8217;t really deliver on that promise until the middle of 2017. That&#8217;s when the company says it will make Azure Stack available, after a delay. Azure Stack is a sort of &#8220;mini-me&#8221; version of the software Microsoft uses to run its huge public cloud data centers around the world, but will instead operate in a customer&#8217;s own smaller facilities. In theory, that means the customer&#8217;s private data centers can work in tandem with the Microsoft-run Azure cloud allowing a segregation of workloads between internal and outside data centers. This is a very big promise. If Microsoft cannot make good on it, one of its biggest arguments that it offers a better cloud solution for risk-averse customers than AWS will ring hollow.","rendered":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ffortune.com\u002Ffortune500\u002Fmicrosoft-25\u002F\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EMicrosoft\u003C\u002Fa\u003E has become Wall Street&#8217;s darling again after\u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.vanityfair.com\u002Fnews\u002Fbusiness\u002F2012\u002F08\u002Fmicrosoft-lost-mojo-steve-ballmer\"\u003E a few rough years\u003C\u002Fa\u003E in the late Steve Ballmer era.

Amazon is assembling masses of &#8220;bare metal&#8221; computers, which unlike the rest of the AWS servers, come with no virtualization. That&#8217;s because VMware&#8217;s software is built using its own flavor of virtualization and that, in turn, meant AWS had to offer VMware a phalanx of servers stripped of the Xen virtualization, which runs the rest of Amazon&#8217;s computers, known collectively as Elastic Compute Cloud or EC2. As AWS head of product Matt Wood explained it to Fortune in November: We partnered with VMware to bring their existing software stack over to EC2. Customers told us they wanted the benefits of AWS and all the benefits of VMware, but didn&#8217;t want to run our hypervisor so we worked on a new part of EC2 that allows VMware to run natively on EC2. Think of VMware as offering a peanut butter and jelly sandwich using its customers&#8217; bread. Now the customer wants to use Amazon&#8217;s bread, except that the only bread Amazon offers comes with the peanut butter built in. Continuing this analogy, Amazon has agreed to strip the peanut butter from many loaves so VMware can craft sandwiches using its own special PB&amp;J formulation on Amazon&#8217;s bread. In theory, that means all those big business customers\u2014and there are many\u2014that use VMware vmw to run their own data centers can more easily forklift their workloads over to AWS data centers using the upcoming product known as VMware cloud for AWS. That&#8217;s an attractive proposition for companies that just want to keep running their virtualized applications as is, instead of re-jiggering them to run on Amazon&#8217;s infrastructure. Virtualization, which lets one set of hardware run more than one set of tasks, is a key linchpin of cloud computing, which is why bare metal is seen as sort of uncloudy. Get Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter When this bare metal work was announced in October, it was painted as a VMware-only option. But there are potentially other big uses for those Xen-free AWS servers. Bare metal, for example, tends to be faster than virtualized hardware for applications like databases that send a lot of data in and out of disk storage. &#8220;There&#8217;s also a growing trend to put containers on bare metal to save on virtualization licensing costs and overhead, but that&#8217;s usually for private cloud,&#8221; says Sebastian Stadil, chief executive of Scalr, a cloud management company. Containers are a modern way developers package up software applications that can run almost anywhere. Bare metal is also useful for older, but still important applications that can&#8217;t be virtualized for various reasons, he notes. Clearly, others have seen opportunity. IBM ibm and Rackspace offer bare metal along with other more heavily-virtualized cloud options. When asked in November if AWS had other potential uses for these bare metal servers, Wood replied there was &#8220;nothing to announce at this time.&#8221; Opinion is mixed among AWS watchers if the company will parlay this bare metal capability beyond VMware or simply use it as a way to attract VMware customers to Amazon data centers and then\u2014as some suspect\u2014try to move them completely to Amazon (minus VMware). &#8220;It would be reasonable to assume that, once those workloads reach AWS, there is value in beginning to rearchitect some (maybe even all, one day) of them to run natively on AWS\u2019 own infrastructure, without the overhead of a VMware license,&#8221; says Paul Miller, a senior analyst with Forrester Research. Sateesh Narahari, vice president of products for Managed Methods, a cloud security company, also views those VMware bare metal instances &#8220;as a transitional state to going full cloud.&#8221; It&#8217;s possible that not even AWS execs know yet what will happen. The cloud giant is nothing if not pragmatic. If Amazon amzn sees opportunity once VMware for AWS Cloud materializes in the middle of 2017, it will capitalize on it. For more on Amazon and VMware, watch: &#8220;If AWS can make the economics and infrastructure management work\u2014and they tend to be good at that\u2014it does seem plausible that we&#8217;ll see a generic AWS bare metal offering sooner rather than later,&#8221; says Forrester&#8217;s Miller.","rendered":"\u003Cp\u003EOne surprising thing about what \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ffortune.com\u002F2016\u002F10\u002F05\u002Fvmware-amazon-cloud-pact\u002F\"\u003EAmazon Web Services\u003C\u002Fa\u003E has done \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ffortune.com\u002F2016\u002F10\u002F14\u002Faws-and-vmware-winners-losers\u002F\"\u003Eto run VMware&#8217;s popular virtualization software\u003C\u002Fa\u003E in its own cloud data centers is just how&#8230;un-cloud-like it seems.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ffortune.com\u002Ffortune500\u002Famazoncom-18\u002F\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EAmazon\u003C\u002Fa\u003E is assembling masses of &#8220;bare metal&#8221; computers, which unlike the rest of the AWS servers, come with no virtualization.

Once a T-Mobile customer installs the update, the Note 7 will no longer be able to charge or connect to networks. AT&amp;T, Verizon, and Sprint will also be sending out the update in coming weeks. The update also displays a reminder that the Note 7 has been recalled and instructions for returning the phone. T-Mobile tmus and Samsung, along with other carriers, agreed to take the unprecedented step of issuing the killer update after some Note 7 owners continued to use their devices despite the recall and many dozens of incidents of batteries exploding, smoking, or catching fire. About 7% of the Note 7 devices sold in the United States were still in use two weeks ago, Samsung said. Get Data Sheet, Fortune&#8217;s technology newsletter. Verizon vz and AT&amp;T t will start distributing the update on January 5. Sprint s will roll it out beginning on January 8. Anyone who bought a Note 7, which has a 5.7- inch screen and comes with a stylus, can return the device to the store or carrier where they bought it and exchange it for a different model or get a refund. Samsung is offering a $100 bill credit to customers who exchange a Note 7 for another Samsung smartphone. Customers who want a refund or opt for another brand qualify for a $25 credit. The Note 7 went on sale in August, but was quickly beset by reports of batteries smoking and catching fire. On September 2, Samsung said it was voluntarily recalling 2.5 million of the devices that had been shipped up to that point.

The company&#8217;s app, which buyers of new bands must download to set up and use their Fitbits, reached No. 2 among all free apps on Apple&#8217;s iPhone app store on Tuesday, behind only Super Mario Run. And it reached No. 8 overall among free apps in Google&#8217;s googl Play store. With the positive signs from the app stores, Fitbit shares fit gained 8% on Tuesday to close at $7.83. Still, at just under $8 a share, the stock price is 39% below where it was last month when the company announced disappointing guidance for holiday sales. In the past, Fitbit sales typically explode in the holiday shopping period; the company&#8217;s revenue increased 92% in the fourth quarter of last year compared to 2014. But on Nov. 2, CEO James Park warned that manufacturing problems and a downturn in China would limit growth and sales for this fourth quarter to only 2% to 5% higher than last year. Fitbit&#8217;s shares tumbled 30% within minutes on the news followed by additional declines over the next few weeks. Get Data Sheet, Fortune&#8217;s technology newsletter. Park has made several moves to get growth back on track, including the recent purchase of the assets of defunct&nbsp;smartwatch maker Pebble. Fitbit is planning to add more smartwatch-like features to its fitness trackers, as rival Apple aapl has focused more on the health and fitness features. For more on Fitbit&#8217;s push towards employers, watch: It is possible that the strong app download data alone may overstate Fitbit&#8217;s position, however. The app data represents &#8220;considerable holiday gift purchases and related installs,&#8221; CFRA Research analyst Scott Kessler wrote, but not enough to significantly change the stock market&#8217;s long-term opinion about the company&#8217;s value. And Fitbit was not mentioned by Amazon amzn as among the most popular wearables sold by the e-commerce site, he noted. That list was dominated by products from Garmin grmn , probably the most athlete-focused of the wearables makers. It may take some hot new products for investors to really get excited about the stock.

Why Microsoft Could Beat Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet to $1 Trillion Mark"},"content":{"plain":"Microsoft&#8217;s $26 billion purchase of LinkedIn gives it a shot to beat Apple, Google parent company Alphabet, Facebook, and Amazon to be the first digital company to hit a $1 trillion market capitalization, according to a research note by Equities.com analyst Michael Markowski. As of Friday, Microsoft msft held the third largest market cap at $494.6 billion after Apple aapl at $618 billion, and Alphabet googl at $548 billion. Amazon amzn and Facebook fb rounded out the top five with market caps of $366 billion and $343.1 billion, respectively. Markowski thinks the LinkedIn purchase will boost Microsoft&#8217;s prospects over rivals for a few reasons, one of which relates to rulings earlier this year by the U.S. Securities &amp; Exchange Commission that will allow more online crowdsourcing of startups. He expects that will lead to an uptick in social investing because companies will be able to advertise directly to prospective individual investors. LinkedIn, with its database of more that 467 million people will come in very handy there. Microsoft, he continues, will be well positioned &#8220;to play a key role in the new social investing industry which is the key to drive crowdfunding to ubiquity.&#8221; Get Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter. Markowski expects the social investing community will become as large as the entire social media segment the next decade. &#8220;Microsoft, with its ownership of LinkedIn, is extremely well positioned to be a major player,&#8221; Markowski writes. &#8220;It has a monopoly on the business social media niche or community.&#8221; Microsoft has another advantage in that it has $27 billion in free cash flow for the trailing twelve months compared to $23.4 billion for Alphabet, $10 billion for Amazon, and $8.5 billion for Facebook. This is an important metric in that it represents the amount of money a company can pull together after capital expenditures to make acquisitions or otherwise invest to improve its business. The LinkedIn deal has yet to play out, but Microsoft is entering year four under chief executive Satya Nadella, has been headed in a very stable direction of late. Its stock hit an all-time high in October, reflecting investor optimism.

iPhone Rumors Hint at a New Mid-Sized Model"},"content":{"plain":"With about nine months to go until Apple&#8217;s expected annual iPhone upgrade announcement, rumors from the company&#8217;s Asian supply chain are intensifying. On Tuesday, unnamed supply chain sources told Apple news blog Mac Otakara in Taiwan that Apple is working on three new models for 2017. Entering the current line up of phones with 4.7- and and 5.5-inch screens could be a new medium-sized model with a 5-inch screen that also includes the dual-lens camera currently only found on the larger screen Plus model. Other sources, including well-regarded analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities, have also reported a third model will be added to the line. But while Kuo has written that only the new model would boast higher-end specs and a brand new edge-to-edge OLED screen, Mac Otakara reported all three phones would contain identical technology. Get Data Sheet, Fortune&#8217;s technology newsletter. The report also included the caveat that Apple will not make a final decision on the complete 2017 iPhone designs until the company&#8217;s second fiscal quarter, which runs through the end of March. Apple&#8217;s iPhone sales 13% shrunk in the first nine months of this year after the company abandon its practice of overhauling the external design of the iPhone every other year and went with a similar design for the third consecutive year. The iPhone 7, introduced in early September, carried almost the same design externally as last year&#8217;s iPhone 6s and 2014&#8217;s iPhone 6. For the holiday quarter, analysts expect Apple might do a little better than last year, when tight supplies hurt sales, but not enough to prevent the first full year of lower sales. Analysts and investors have been hoping for a major overhaul by Apple aapl to attract more upgraders in 2017, with some predicting for a &#8220;super cycle&#8221; based on rumors about major changes, like OLED screens and wireless charging capability.

In tech, the semiconductor industry has rapidly consolidated while mid-sized players like EMC and LinkedIn were gobbled up by larger peers. But there&#8217;s still some potentially massive deals to come in 2017 that may not have even been imaginable in 2016. Call it the Trump bump for tech M&amp;A. Under President Obama&#8217;s watch, regulators at the Department of Justice&#8217;s antitrust division and the Federal Communications Commission stepped in to block a bevy of combinations that they argued would reduce competition and hurt consumers. The moves stopped Comcast from buying Time Warner Cable, and prevented T-Mobile from going to AT&amp;T or Sprint. Now President-elect Donald Trump is signaling with his transition appointments and general pro-business stance that a lot more combinations may be acceptable. David Higbee, an M&amp;A lawyer at Hunton &amp; Williams who worked in the Bush administration, is helping to oversee Trump&#8217;s Justice Department transition, along with economist and Republican Federal Trade Commission member Joshua Wright. Both are seen as tilting much more pro-merger than Obama&#8217;s appointees. The same is true of Trump&#8217;s three transition team members overseeing the FCC. Further fueling merger mania, Trump is also widely expected to work with the Republican majority in Congress to slash the tax on corporate overseas profits. Companies like Apple aapl and Microsoft msft have accumulated hundreds of billions of dollars in overseas profits that can&#8217;t be brought back to the United States without a 35% tax. Trump could slash the rate to 10%, providing the biggest tech companies with a lot of dough to make deals. Get Data Sheet, Fortune&#8217;s technology newsletter. Bottom line? Telecom industry analyst Simon Flannery at Morgan Stanley ms is hardly alone in expecting &#8220;a prolonged period of M&amp;A activity given the more benign regulatory outlook.&#8221; The most talked-about potential 2017 deal revolves around T-Mobile, the third-largest wireless carrier and the company that has added more subscribers over the past few years than the rest of the industry combined. Not only could Sprint s dream of buying T-Mobile tmus under Trump, but big cable companies like Comcast cmcsa or Charter Communications chtr , which plan to enter the wireless market next year, may also be bidders. If the bidders want to go after a smaller target U.S. Cellular usm could be in play, as well. Analysts think the cable players may be more likely to make a deal at this point that Sprint and its majority owner Softbank Group, already coping with massive debt from earlier moves. And T-Mobile&#8217;s outspoken CEO John Legere says his talks with tech giants have convinced him that the ultimate landing spot for his company may be in Silicon Valley with the likes of Google googl or Facebook fb . Further consolidation could also come to the data center market, where current antitrust overseers might oppose acquisitions by the biggest companies. But under Trump, while Google, Microsoft, and Amazon amzn dominate, smaller players like Equinix eqix , Digital Realty Trust dlr , and CyrusOne cone could be fodder for acquisitions. Related: Trump vs. Tech: It\u2019s Going to Get Rockier The Trump hints have some analysts dreaming much bigger. Perhaps Sprint and T-Mobile will merge, while also picking up Dish Network dish , analyst Timothy Horan, at Oppenheimer &amp; Co, hypothesized earlier his month. The triple combo could &#8220;create a discounted quad-play service company with over 300 MHz of spectrum,&#8221; Horan wrote. That in turn could lead Comcast and Verizon vz possibly to merge and AT&amp;T t then might buy parts of CenturyLink ctl , Frontier Communications ftr or Windstream win , Horan said. Verizon&#8217;s planned $4.8 billion deal for Yahoo isn&#8217;t go well after a second major hacking revelation, so the carrier could be in the market for other acquisitions to bolster its digital advertising strategy, analysts say. Possible targets for CEO Lowell McAdam could include music service Pandora Media p or struggling social network Twitter twtr , BTIG Research analyst Walt Piecyk told Bloomberg News. Other combinations that have been tossed about seem less plausible. Even if pro-business regulators allowed Amazon to buy Barnes &amp; Noble bks , why would the House of Bezos want to add the huge and ailing book chain to its assets? And while Apple could get a huge tax windfall of repatriated cash under Trump, buying rumored targets Netflix nflx or Tesla tsla would cost a fortune and wreck its price-to-earnings ratio. What about the biggest deal announced in 2016? On the campaign trail, Trump promised to block AT&amp;T&#8217;s $109 billion Time Warner twx acquisition. &#8220;AT&amp;T is buying Time Warner and thus CNN, a deal we will not approve in my administration because it&#8217;s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few,&#8221; Trump said in a speech in October. For more on opposition to AT&amp;T&#8217;s Time Warner deal, watch: But signs continue to emerge that Trump may be backing off the pledge. AT&amp;T officials who talked with transition officials came away confident the deal could survive, the Financial Times reported earlier this month. In the era of Trump, it seems many more deals are within the realm of possibility\u2014even ones the President-elect himself has once opposed.","rendered":"\u003Cp\u003EThe past few years have been extremely busy in the world of mergers and acquisitions, setting records around the world.

Lessons learned the hard way by early adopters become tweaks and improvements to benefit subsequent revised models. Get Data Sheet, Fortune&#8217;s technology newsletter. And there&#8217;s probably a similar lesson for computer and gadget buyers: early adopters be damned. This week, Consumer Reports turned its sights on Apple&#8217;s newest MacBook Pro laptop line. The first major overhaul since Apple introduced Retina Display screens in 2012, the new lineup features a thinner, more squared off body, the elimination of almost all ports but the USB-C connector, and the cool looking &#8220;Touch Bar&#8221; screen atop the keyboard. The internals were also completely revamped, from the addition of sixth generation Intel &#8220;Skylake&#8221; processors to faster solid state disks and lighter batteries. Many early reviews loved the new machines. &#8220;The best laptop ever made just changed the scene forever,&#8221; Digital Spy raved. &#8220;Well worth splurging,&#8221; CNET concluded. &#8220;Solid performers,&#8221; if a bit overpriced, Macworld found. But as Consumer Reports\u2014and a few others\u2014uncovered through careful testing, something appears highly amiss in the newly designed battery system. While Apple claims up to 10 hours of battery life in typical usage, testers in the Consumer Reports lab found incredibly varied results on three models they had purchased at a retail store. &#8220;In a series of three consecutive tests, the 13-inch model with the Touch Bar ran for 16 hours in the first trial, 12.75 hours in the second, and just 3.75 hours in the third,&#8221; the group wrote in its review. &#8220;The 13-inch model without the Touch Bar worked for 19.5 hours in one trial but only 4.5 hours in the next. And the numbers for the 15-inch laptop ranged from 18.5 down to 8 hours.&#8221; For more on the introduction of the new MacBook Pro, watch: And as a result of the unreliable battery life, for the first time in the history of Apple&#8217;s MacBook line, Consumer Reports declined to give the 2016 models a rating of &#8220;recommended.&#8221; Hardly the most exclusive of raters, Consumer Reports currently has 66 different laptops of varying screen sizes on its &#8220;recommended&#8221; list, including seven older Apple models. Late on Friday, Apple senior vice president Phil Schiller took to Twitter to say that Apple was talking to Consumer Reports about the test results. &#8220;Working with CR to understand their battery tests,&#8221; Schiller wrote. &#8220;Results do not match our extensive lab tests or field data.&#8221; There&#8217;s little doubt that Apple aapl has already turned its vast might and resources to address the battery shortcoming and probably a bunch of other complaints, dings, and nitpicks from MacBook Pro reviewers. Some fixes may come through software updates, but as with cars, the real solutions and big improvements probably will have to wait for next year&#8217;s refresh.

Based on a very informal poll of about two dozen colleagues and friends, nearly everyone agrees that that LinkedIn&#8217;s database is an incredible trove of information about current or prospective employees or employers. It&#8217;s useful for finding and keeping in touch with long-lost colleagues, or finding potential new job or filling job openings. LinkedIn claims 467 million registered users, with two new people joining every second, although it does not disclose how many pay. Only one of the respondents says she&#8217;s quit the business-focused social network, deleting her account. Other than that, here are some suggestions. Fix the Interface There were lots of complaints about the user interface, which is clumsy and seems in a constant state of flux. &#8220;They keep changing it,&#8221; says Catherine Marenghi, a Boston area public relations executive and author. It is very hard to find things\u2014like support, she adds. To be fair, LinkedIn is already on this. In September, the company outlined plans for a desktop redesign, due early next year. Go Easy on the Spam The biggest complaint seems to be LinkedIn&#8217;s propensity to &#8220;spam&#8221; users, requesting more contacts\u2014a feature that thankfully can now be turned off\u2014and reminding them to send birthday wishes or holiday greetings to long-lost colleagues. Jeff Shuey, a former executive at Eastman Kodak kodk and K2 Software, likes finding and keeping in touch with former colleagues with LinkedIn. What he doesn&#8217;t like? &#8220;Birthday wishes. This is not Facebook fb people!&#8221; Kill Endorsements The myriad of requests to &#8220;endorse&#8221; contacts is a source of chagrin. No one said they pay any attention to these endorsements. &#8220;The endorsements are absolute crap,&#8221; says Yuval Shavit, a Boston-area software engineer via email. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been endorsed for technologies that I have no experience in. For instance, languages that I have literally never written a single line in. LinkedIn does a bad job curating the info about its users.&#8221; Said another wag: &#8220;I love getting endorsements on skills I don&#8217;t have from people I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; You can kill endorsements, although it&#8217;s not intuitive how to do so, and you have to wonder if they random endorsements have value. Beef up the Mobile App A vice president of a global healthcare organization based on the East Coast finds LinkedIn&#8217;s mobile app less than inspiring. &#8220;The most annoying bug is when you get a notification in mobile email and click the link to take whatever action, the mobile app opens and takes you to your home page. It should behave like the desktop browser app and let you complete whatever the action is,&#8221; he said. (This executive requested anonymity because he is not authorized to speak about the company&#8217;s IT use.) Now the Good News The social network also got some rave reviews, mostly from people who pay for advanced versions for recruitment or marketing Dee Dee Walsh, vice president of marketing for Mobilize.net, a Bellevue, Wash. company that helps migrate older software to the Web, uses LinkedIn all the time both to recruit new employees and for marketing. &#8220;When I place an ad, it\u2019s really effective especially for non-technical jobs. I get a lot of really great candidates because I can target by title, by keyword, by group,&#8221; she noted. It&#8217;s less effective than Stackoverflow for technical or engineering candidates, but she thinks Microsoft msft ownership could help there. Get Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter. Google&#8217;s googl advertising products let companies buy keywords, but doesn&#8217;t allow targeting to this degree, Walsh continues. She also looked at Rainking and DiscoverOrg databases of prospective IT buyers within companies, but they don&#8217;t let her fine tune her searches the way LinkedIn does, she says. For marketing, sales, and recruiting, the ability to really pinpoint searches is critical. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be a pest to people, although I know I am. LinkedIn helps me be a pest to the right people,&#8221; Walsh tells Fortune. Marketers can embed LinkedIn code on their websites which then provides them with the LinkedIn profile of any visitor, a very common usage of the product. The reports on web site visitors that LinkedIn provides are very useful, several marketing executives said. For more on Microsoft-LinkedIn, watch: The thing about LinkedIn for many users is that it cuts both ways. &#8220;I don&#8217;t like that LinkedIn will tell people when I&#8217;ve stalked them. Though, I do like knowing who is stalking me,&#8221; says Jennifer Cloer, founder of reTHINKit PR in Portland Oregon. She got back to Fortune later to note that she learned how to switch her privacy settings to incognito, so she can stalk people surreptitiously going forward. LinkedIn&#8217;s strength lies in the data it holds on millions of people. But that can lead to problems: How does it surface the most relevant stuff and promote interaction without bombarding people with minutia? And now that Microsoft plans to integrate LinkedIn with Office, Outlook and other tentpole products, as noted by LinkedIn chief executive Jeff Weiner, it must also weigh concerns of users about exposing so much of their information to a broader audience. It may be great for Microsoft Dynamics CRM users who want to pump possible leads into their sales application, but may also turn off users who can vote with their feet to turn off the network if it gets too obtrusive. If you love the sponsored content you now see in LinkedIn, you may rejoice that you&#8217;ll soon see it across Microsoft properties going forward. But, if you find it pointless, you may not be happy. And finally, while no one brought this up, given that LinkedIn had to reset 55,000 passwords for users of its Lynda.com online education site early this week, it seems the company and its new parent have work to do on the security front. But then again, who doesn&#8217;t?","rendered":"\u003Cp\u003ENow that Microsoft&#8217;s \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ffortune.com\u002F2016\u002F06\u002F13\u002Fmicrosoft-buying-linkedin\u002F\"\u003E$26 billion purchase of LinkedIn\u003C\u002Fa\u003E is \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ffortune.com\u002F2016\u002F12\u002F08\u002Fsatya-nadella-microsoft-linkedin\u002F\"\u003Efinal\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, here are some suggestions for things that Microsoft chief executive officer Satya Nadella could do to improve the huge\u2014but sometimes annoying\u2014business network.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBased on a \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C\u002Fem\u003E informal poll of about two dozen colleagues and friends, nearly everyone agrees that that LinkedIn&#8217;s database is an incredible trove of information about current or prospective employees or employers.

Trump posted his Twitter message a day after the president-elect met with the chief executives of both aerospace companies, using the bully pulpit to press them on projects he says are too expensive. In after-hours trading following Trump&#8217;s tweet, Lockheed shares fell 2 percent and Boeing&#8217;s rose 0.7%. &#8220;Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!&#8221; Trump said. Lockheed declined to comment. The F-35 program is a critical sales generator for the company, accounting for 20 percent of last year&#8217;s revenue of $46.1 billion. The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Boeing spokesman Todd Blecher said in an email that the company was committed to providing the capability and affordability to meet national security needs. While the F-35 program has been dogged by problems and costs have escalated to an estimated $379 billion, it is significantly newer than the F-18, which does not have the same stealth capabilities. &#8220;They&#8217;re two completely different aircraft from different generations,&#8221; said Phillip Carter, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington-based think tank. &#8220;It&#8217;s like comparing an old jeep to a Humvee.&#8221; Dan Grazier of the Project on Government Oversight, a nonprofit that investigates government contractors, said the F-35&#8217;s stealth capabilities drove the cost up, but its usefulness had not yet been demonstrated. He said canceling the program, however, would be &#8220;disruptive.&#8221; On the campaign trail, Trump touted his negotiating skills as a businessman, and he appears to be using similar tactics as he prepares to take office on Jan. 20. It was not clear how his blunt style would translate to Pentagon procurement or international diplomacy. On Wednesday, Trump met the CEOs of Lockheed and Boeing at his resort in Palm Beach, Florida. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg told reporters there that he had guaranteed costs would not get out of control for a replacement to Air Force One, the presidential plane, another project Trump calls too expensive. Lockheed Chief Executive Marillyn Hewson did not speak to reporters but said in a statement that the meeting was &#8220;productive.&#8221; Trump told reporters he wanted to cut the F-35 program&#8217;s costs. If he scrapped the F-35, such a move by a new administration would have some precedent. Then-President Jimmy Carter canceled the B-1 bomber program in June 1977, although it was resurrected by his White House successor, Ronald Reagan. Trump&#8217;s jockeying for leverage via his Twitter account is likely to be a hurdle for all U.S. defense contractors in the next administration, Roman Schweizer, aerospace and defense analyst at financial services firm Cowen &amp; Co, wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. &#8220;We have no idea how this plays out but believe &#8216;Twitter risk&#8217; for defense companies could be a significant issue over the next four years,&#8221; Schweizer wrote. &#8220;This is Lockheed Martin&#8217;s time in the barrel.&#8221;","rendered":"\u003Cp class=\"p1\"\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"s1\"\u003EU.S. President-elect Donald Trump heaped pressure on \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ffortune.com\u002Ffortune500\u002Flockheed-martin-60\u002F\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ELockheed Martin\u003C\u002Fa\u003E \u003Cspan class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"lmt\"\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\u003Cspan class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\"\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003Ca class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ffortune.com\u002Ffortune500\u002Flockheed-martin-60\u002F\"\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003Cspan class=\"ticker\"\u003Elmt\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003Cspan class=\"change percent\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\n\t\t\t\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E on Thursday, saying he viewed costs for the aerospace company&#8217;s F-35 fighter as too high and had asked \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ffortune.com\u002Ffortune500\u002Fboeing-24\u002F\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EBoeing\u003C\u002Fa\u003E \u003Cspan class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"ba\"\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\u003Cspan class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\"\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003Ca class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ffortune.com\u002Ffortune500\u002Fboeing-24\u002F\"\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003Cspan class=\"ticker\"\u003Eba\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003Cspan class=\"change percent\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\n\t\t\t\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E to offer a price for an older aircraft that lacks the same stealth capabilities.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"p1\"\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"s1\"\u003ETrump posted his Twitter message a day after the president-elect met with the chief executives of both aerospace companies, using the bully pulpit to press them on projects he says are too expensive.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"p1\"\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"s1\"\u003EIn after-hours trading following Trump&#8217;s tweet, Lockheed shares fell 2 percent and Boeing&#8217;s rose 0.7%.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"p1\"\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"s1\"\u003E&#8220;Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!&#8221; Trump said.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"p1\"\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"s1\"\u003ELockheed declined to comment.

By the end of the first quarter of 2017, Fortune has learned there will be 27 women leading Fortune 500 companies. While that is an undeniably paltry number, it&#8217;s better than the number of female CEOs in 2016\u2014or ever. The previous record for most female CEOs on the list was set in 2014, when 24 women made the list. This number stayed unchanged the following two years (as of December 2016), meaning that the percentage of women at the top of the Fortune 500 has been holding steady at 4.8%. While we will see a few female chiefs stepping down next year, these losses will be offset by a number of powerful businesswomen stepping up to take their places. For the first time ever, more than 5% of CEOs on the list will be women. Subscribe to the Broadsheet, Fortune\u2019s daily newsletter on the world\u2019s most powerful women. NEWCOMERS 1.

Third-Party Sellers Had Record-Breaking Sales in 2016"},"content":{"plain":"Amazon.com amzn shipped 50 percent more items this holiday season than last for third-party vendors and doubled the amount for 2016 overall, the retail giant said on Wednesday. The news offers new data points for investors who are hoping Amazon will post a profit for the fourth quarter when it announces results in the coming weeks. Seattle-based Amazon, known for its roller coaster results in years past, has forecast that operating income would range from nothing to $1.25 billion. Amazon, the world&#8217;s largest online retailer, has said the 2016 holiday was its best-ever shopping season. However, high spending on warehouses and video production are expected to drag on profits. More sellers are paying the company to store, pack and ship their goods through the Fulfillment by Amazon service. Amazon more than doubled the items it delivered for other sellers in 2016 from the year prior to exceed two billion, a spokesman said. Active sellers using the fulfillment service rose more than 70 percent in the year, Amazon said on Wednesday. It did not specify the total number of vendors. &nbsp; Third-party sales were &#8220;record-breaking&#8221; in 2016, Peter Faricy, vice president for Amazon Marketplace, said in the statement. Amazon takes a cut of the proceeds. Amazon will likely top its profit-margin guidance for the fourth quarter, Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy said in a research note last week. Price competition seemed subdued in December and Amazon avoided delivery bottlenecks it experienced in 2015, he said. Cyber Monday, a shopping spree four days after Thanksgiving, is another indicator. Shoppers ordered more than 28 million items from third-party sellers this year, versus more than 23 million items on Cyber Monday in 2015, Amazon said. Amazon is building its own fleet of planes to handle the rise in orders and supplement shipping that it contracts out to companies like FedEx Corp and United Parcel Service Inc . Data reviewed by Reuters and interviews with airport officials show that Amazon has loaded these aircraft with big but lightweight boxes, helping it dodge fees from cargo carriers increasingly pricing based on volume rather than weight.

tightly linked the economies of Canada and the United States are, amid fears of a protectionist Trump administration. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who has promised to either renegotiate or scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), has said overhauling trade policy will be a top priority after he takes office on Jan. 20. Canada sends 75% of its exports to the United States and could suffer from changes to NAFTA, which also includes Mexico. Ford Motor f on Tuesday scrapped a planned Mexican car factory and added 700 jobs in Michigan following criticism by Trump, who turned his attention toward General Motors gm with the threat of a &#8220;big border tax&#8221; over compact cars made in Mexico. In the video address, Trudeau and David MacNaughton, the Canadian ambassador to Washington, stressed the closeness of ties between the neighbors. &#8220;We&#8217;ve built an economic relationship that supports jobs in every Congressional district. We are the largest international customer for goods and services made in the USA,&#8221; said Trudeau, who was filmed in his office in front of the U.S. and Canadian flags. MacNaughton said Canada was ready to work with Congress to make the lives of citizens in both nations better and more prosperous. Christine Constantin, a spokeswoman for the Canadian embassy in Washington, said ambassadors had sent video greetings to the two previous opening sessions of Congress. For more on Canada-U.S. relations, watch Fortune&#8217;s video: Trudeau, who has made ties with the United States a priority, was asked by the embassy to appear in the video, she said. Trudeau spokesman Cameron Ahmad declined to elaborate on the video, saying the prime minister&#8217;s message spoke for itself.

But not all are keen to connect with systems developed by Apple or Google. Ford Motor f and Toyota Motor tm have formed a consortium to accelerate the deployment of open source software aimed at giving consumers more options in how they connect and control their smartphone apps. The organization is called the SmartDeviceLink (SDL) Consortium, a reference to an open source software version of Ford&#8217;s AppLink. Mazda Motor mzday , PSA Group, Fuji Heavy Industries fujhy , and Suzuki Motor szkmy , are the first automaker members of the consortium. Suppliers Elektrobit ebttf , Harman har , Luxoft lxft , QNX, and Xevo have also joined the nonprofit organization. Get Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter. The formation of the consortium follows Toyota&#8217;s announcement last January that it planned to use the SDL software in its cars to give drivers command and control of smartphone apps through dashboard buttons, display screens, and voice recognition tech. Toyota plans to commercialize an infotainment system using SDL around 2018. The unusual agreement between the typically competitive companies showed the wariness of some automakers to hand over control to third-party companies\u2014namely Apple aapl and Google googl . Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are two connectivity systems that allow a smartphone to take over a car\u2019s center screen. Once users plug their smartphones into the car\u2019s USB ports, the phones&#8217; maps and navigation, music, and selected apps are integrated onto the central screen. Ford and Toyota argue that an open source code is a better approach, because developers and automakers working together can increase the quality and security of the software. If the industry adopts the software, developers would gain access to millions of vehicles and their drivers worldwide, while participating companies would still be able to retain control over the level of access outside parties have to vehicle data, the companies said. Ford has abandoned Apple&#8217;s and Google&#8217;s offerings, however. The company has taken an all-of-the-above approach to connectivity in the car.

Cancels a $1.6 Billion Mexico Plant and Adds 700 Jobs in Michigan"},"content":{"plain":"Ford Motor Co f on Tuesday scrapped a planned Mexican car factory and added 700 jobs in Michigan following criticism by Donald Trump, as the U.S. president-elect turned his attention toward rival General Motors Co with the threat of a &#8220;big border tax&#8221; over compact cars made in Mexico. Ford CEO Mark Fields called the move &#8220;a vote of confidence&#8221; in Trump, but primarily a response to a decline in North American demand for small cars like those that would have been made at the Mexican plant. He said Ford would have made the same decision even if Trump had not been elected. Ford will cancel plans unveiled in April to spend $1.6 billion to build the new plant in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, a project Trump urged the automaker to abandon and called an &#8220;absolute disgrace&#8221; during the election campaign. The No. 2 U.S. automaker also said it would invest $700 million to expand the Flat Rock, Michigan factory and would make new electric, hybrid and autonomous vehicles there. Trump&#8217;s efforts to browbeat the U.S. car industry show he may go further than other modern presidents to try to influence corporate decisions, especially those related to trade and investment. In a Twitter post hours before Ford&#8217;s announcement, Trump wrote, &#8220;General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!&#8221; GM, the largest U.S. automaker, said making some of the Cruze cars in the plant in Coahuila, Mexico was part of its strategy to serve global customers, not sell those vehicles in the United States. Trump&#8217;s GM tweet was his latest broadside aimed at an American company over jobs, imports and costs even before he takes office on Jan. 20. Mexico&#8217;s government said it regrets Ford&#8217;s decision and has ensured that the company will reimburse San Luis Potosi state for any costs associated with the investment. &#8220;Obviously, this isn&#8217;t a good decision for us,&#8221; said Mexico&#8217;s economy minister, Ildefonso Guajardo. Ford said it still will shift production from Michigan of its Focus compact car to an existing plant in Hermosillo, Mexico. Fields said he expects Michigan to give incentives for Ford&#8217;s investment in Flat Rock. Ford spokeswoman Jennifer Flake said the automaker will save $500 million by not opening the new plant in the near term, but will have some undisclosed costs to retool the other Mexican plant to build the Focus. Ford shares closed up about 3.8 percent. GM shares rose about 0.9 percent. TRUMP NOTIFIED Top Ford executives personally notified Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence of their decision. Fields praised tax and regulatory proposals advocated by Trump and his fellow Republicans who control Congress. &#8220;Our view is that we see a more positive U.S. manufacturing business environment under President-elect Trump and the pro-growth policies and proposals that he&#8217;s talking about, so this is a vote of confidence for President-elect Trump and some of the policies that they may be pursuing,&#8221; Fields said. Union workers gathered at the Flat Rock factory cheered Fields&#8217; announcement. Hiring of the 700 new workers there will probably start in 2018 with the majority of it in 2020, Fields said. Trump said during the presidential campaign that if elected he would not allow Ford to open the new plant in Mexico and would slap hefty tariffs on imported Ford vehicles. Trump also accused Mexico of sending criminals and rapists into the United States and vowed to build a border wall to combat illegal immigration. Since winning the Nov. 8 election, Trump has targeted a wide range of American companies also including United Technologies Inc, Boeing Co and Lockheed Martin Corp. Trump also has touted decisions by companies to keep some production in the United States, including United&#8217;s Carrier unit in Indiana. Trump previously vowed to hit companies that shift production from America to other countries with a 35 percent tax on their exports into the United States. He also has denounced the North American Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Mexico and Canada. Fields said there were no negotiations between Ford and the incoming president over canceling the Mexico plant or investing in Michigan. Ford will build a battery electric SUV with a 300-mile (482-km) driving range at the Michigan plant by 2020, and will launch production there by 2021 of a fully autonomous vehicle without a steering wheel or a brake pedal for use in ride services fleets. Ford also plans new hybrid versions of its F-150 pickup truck, Mustang and police vehicles by 2020. GM said it sold about 190,000 Cruze cars in the United States in 2016. All of the sedan versions sold in the United States, about 185,500, were built at its Lordstown, Ohio plant. About 4,500 hatchback Cruze versions were assembled in Mexico and sold in the United States.

Xerox&#8217;s sibling business services unit, Conduent, spun off into a separate company on Tuesday. It must now find a way to lift its growth amid stagnant sales and a tough market. Xerox acquired the roots of Conduent, which handles everything from human resources services for healthcare companies to mobile parking apps for the city of Los Angeles, by buying Affiliated Computer Services for nearly $6.4 billion in 2010. The deal was supposed to help Xerox find another source of revenue beyond it&#8217;s core copier and printing business. But like other big business tech companies like IBM and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Xerox&#8217;s overall revenue has declined in recent years. With few people printing and copying, Xerox&#8217;s annual sales have dropped each year since 2011. During much of that time, Xerox&#8217;s business services group struggled. In a nine-month period ending in September, Conduent had $4.9 billion in revenue, or nearly flat compared to the previous year. Xerox&#8217;s executives say that two smaller, more nimble businesses will be able to better adapt to a rapidly changing technology world. The argument echoes that of Hewlett Packard, which split into two companies last year. But Wall Street didn&#8217;t exactly give Conduent a happy birthday. In its first day of trading, the company&#8217;s shares fell 8% to $13.72. In this edited interview with Fortune, Conduent CEO Ashok Vemuri talks about splitting from Xerox xrx , competing with IBM ibm and HPE hpe , and new beginnings. Fortune: Tell me about splitting from Xerox. Vemuri: If you go back six to seven years when Xerox acquired a company called ACS [Affiliated Computer Services] in 2010, the thesis of that acquisition was that Xerox was a hardware manufacturing company. This was during a recession, and management thought the best would be to serve your clients soup-to-nuts, if you will, by acquiring a services company. It was very similar to other companies\u2014think Dell with Perot [$3.9 billion deal was announced in 2009], HP with EDS [$13.9 billion deal was announced in 2008] That construct of combining hardware with services didn\u2019t necessarily pan out. So, it was thought that our two companies would be better served if they were sliced off and were allowed to control their own destiny and serve their own clients, their own market, their own technology, etc. Get Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter. Why did hardware companies think that they also had to have business services? It was the height of the recession. This was considered a sort of natural hedge in terms of buying revenue. Secondly, it was believed that if you sold a piece of equipment to a client, they were servicing that equipment with somebody else. So why would I not, if I sold you that equipment, service it instead? Thirdly, services companies were on the ascendancy. Remember, even 10 years ago, print, paper, ink was on decline, and it continues to be so. The services business is where the margins are\u2014where the cash flow is\u2014and your need for spending is much less. If you look at an equipment provider like Xerox, it\u2019s more a finance operating lease company, because they fund your purchase of a printer. A services business is asset light. It does not require you to invest your balance sheet in a big way. Some analysts believe the downside of a service company, however, are the costs of hiring employees, which can eat into profitability. That\u2019s wrong. That is the conventional way of thinking about services businesses. In our model, 80% of our business is transactions based. We do everything off the back of technology. That allows me to add a multitude of services off a particular platform. Let me give you an example. If I have three or four clients, I cannot repurpose my people because they aren\u2019t fungible. I can\u2019t say, \u201cHey, for two hours you be on the call center, for two hours you do transaction processing, for two hours you work for Client A, and for two hours you work for Client B.\u201d But I can do it if I do it on the back of technology, because my platform aggregates and creates air pockets that allow me to work for multiple clients. I can repurpose my platform to do multiple functions. With people, I can\u2019t expect them to work more than eight hours. What are the services that your company does? We serve two broad segments. One is the public sector. We work with all 50 U.S. states and over 500 government entities worldwide. We do a lot of work in transportation. Think about parking: You use a parking app pay over the phone, and the phone reminds you after 45 minutes to pay more We are now handling road tolls\u2014so think EasyPass in California and SunPass in Florida. We are the world\u2019s largest prepaid card processor. We do things like welfare, Social Security, Food Stamps. The other part of the business is commercial. We work with 74 of the top Fortune 100 companies. We support them on mission-critical systems. Apple aapl co-founder Steve Jobs once publicly criticized Xerox for not capitalizing on its technology. Correct. In a similar way, a lot of Conduent\u2019s technology was invented in Xerox over the last six years. The ACS story is six years old; a little is left, but a lot of that is new and a lot of that was invented in Xerox. Now that you\u2019re an independent company, how do you balance spending on research into new technologies with pleasing investors? Clearly today, technology is at a place where you don\u2019t necessarily have to build components in-house; you can buy them from others. We have to rid ourselves of the sensibility we\u2019ve had that if it\u2019s not invented in-house it\u2019s not worth looking at. We are now a public company, so our research dollars have to give a return in the year that I give the dollar in, unlike in the past in which the time to yield was like five to seven years. Having said that, technology will be the underpinning of every process we bring. Therefore we must invest in our technology platform and make it modern. The speed of technology is changing and the way it is being consumed is dramatically changing in such a short time frame that our investments have to reflect that time horizon as well as the fact that these changes are happening. Who are your biggest competitors? We are in a wide range of industries, so we have a lot of them. A lot of them are very niche and specialized companies. Across our various businesses, we see as competitors like Accenture, we see IBM, we see HPE. My advantage is I\u2019m a pure-play business process provider. I\u2019m the largest in revenue and in size and scale. For more about enterprise technology, watch: How do you distinguish yourselves from the big business services groups of companies like IBM that may brag that their technology separates them from the pack? Technology is a commodity. I can buy technology every other day at half the price I paid the day before yesterday. The technology product isn\u2019t going to give you any differentiation. What gives you differentiation is what you do with that technology. If I understand processes and have functional and domain knowledge, then I can actually leverage that technology and literally make it jump through hoops to provide me the answer or the outcome that the business really needs.","rendered":"\u003Cp\u003EIt&#8217;s a new beginning for Xerox&#8217;s spawn.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EXerox&#8217;s sibling business services unit, Conduent, spun off into a separate company on Tuesday.

This might have seemed like an academic ethical question in the past, but with business mogul Donald Trump set to move into the Oval Office soon, it has become much more pressing, and more than a little contentious. During a weekend interview on Meet the Press that included both New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet and Wall Street Journal editor Gerard Baker, the latter was asked whether he thought inaccurate statements by Trump should be specifically called out as lies. Baker said that he didn&#8217;t think so, because the word &#8220;lie&#8221; implies that the person told an untruth on purpose. Instead, the Journal editor argued that media outlets should simply present the facts and leave it up to readers to determine the truth. The word lie &#8220;implies much more than just saying something that&#8217;s false. It implies a deliberate intent to mislead,&#8221; Baker said. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s up to the reader to make up their own mind&#8230; If you start ascribing a moral intent, as it were, to someone by saying that they&#8217;ve lied, I think you run the risk that you look like you\u2019re not being objective.&#8221; Get Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter. Legendary news anchor Dan Rather, however, took issue with this approach in a post on his Facebook page that was widely shared among journalists. Rather called Baker&#8217;s argument &#8220;deeply disturbing.&#8221; It is not the proper role of journalists, the former anchor said, &#8220;to meet lies \u2014 especially from someone of Mr. Trump\u2019s stature and power \u2014 by hiding behind semantics and euphemisms. Our role is to call it as we see it, based on solid reporting. When something is, in fact, a demonstrable lie, it is our responsibility to say so.&#8221; In his NBC interview, Baker referred to Trump&#8217;s repeated statements that Muslims were seen cheering in New Jersey when the World Trade Center towers fell. The Journal reported that there was no evidence this had actually occurred, Baker said, and then left it to the reader to decide. But even if the standard principle is that something can only be called a lie if we know the intent of the speaker\u2014as the Journal editor argues it should be\u2014can we not assume that Trump was making those statements with a deliberate intent to mislead voters about Muslim behavior? After all, he said it multiple times, even after it had been proven false. The same thing goes for many other Trump statements on a wide range of issues. He has repeatedly said that millions of people voted illegally, which isn&#8217;t true, and that ending the &#8220;stop and frisk&#8221; campaign in New York increased crime, which it didn&#8217;t. There are literally hundreds of such examples. At what point does repeating them stop being a falsehood and become an outright lie? In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally &mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2016 Baker&#8217;s argument is very similar to the one made by moderators like Fox News host Chris Wallace and MSNBC host Chris Matthews during the presidential debates. Wallace said he didn&#8217;t think it was a moderator&#8217;s job to be a &#8220;truth squad,&#8221; while Matthews said calling out lies would be equivalent to expressing an opinion, which journalists shouldn&#8217;t do. Those comments came up in large part because Matt Lauer of NBC was widely criticized for failing to challenge Trump during an interview when the candidate claimed that he never supported the war in Iraq, despite abundant evidence to the contrary. In a Twitter debate on Monday with a number of journalists, including Fusion writer Felix Salmon and former New York Observer editor Elizabeth Spiers, Time Inc.&#8217;s chief content officer Alan Murray (who is also editor of this magazine) defended Baker&#8217;s approach, saying journalists should be careful about using the word &#8220;lie&#8221; without proof that the speaker deliberately intended to mislead. Words matter. &quot;False&quot; and &quot;lie&quot; are not the same thing. https:\u002F\u002Ft.co\u002FACM5exCej2 &mdash; Alan Murray (@alansmurray) January 3, 2017 Spiers and others, however, said journalists make intelligent inferences about a politician&#8217;s motives all the time, and catching one in a lie is no different. Former Fortune writer Dan Primack, who is now with the media startup Axios, said: &#8220;I agree about being careful. But if you can prove the shoe fits, then put it on.&#8221; Washington Post writer Greg Sargent argued that &#8220;Donald Trump lies. A lot. And news organizations should say so.&#8221; These are all of Trump&#8217;s potential conflicts of interest: Inaccurate statements aren&#8217;t always lies. As Murray pointed out, Ronald Reagan said a lot of things that turned out not to be true, but not all of them were lies. But he didn&#8217;t repeatedly tell the same untruths over and over in the face of all the available evidence, the way Trump has done throughout his campaign, behavior he will presumably continue once he is in office. How can a self-respecting journalistic organization not call those lies? In the kind of broken media landscape we currently have, something Trump took advantage of better than anyone else during the campaign, not calling out obvious lies risks providing him with the headlines he wants\u2014apparently reinforcing his questionable claims\u2014with the evidence against his statements buried in the lower parts of a story that no one will read.","rendered":"\u003Cp\u003EWhat should the media do when the U.S. president says something that is clearly and unequivocally not true?

The move has prompted the EU finance ministers to freeze implementation of debt restructuring. Greece is at the brink again. This is the modern-day, Greek economic tragedy. But unlike the three-acts ancient Greek tragedies, we\u2019ve seen many acts and often the horrible events happen on stage. Of the main actors, the Greek government repeatedly threatens with suicide elections; the IMF tries to apply the same rules to all countries irrespective of development level; the EU bureaucrats paint a rosy picture with no grounding in reality or economics, and German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble keeps reading the same austerity rulebook no matter what the circumstances. Even worse, there is practically no dialogue among the actors \u2013 they deliver their monologues past each other, each trying to please a different chorus. How did we get here (again), is there hope, and, more importantly, and how does it end? After two large bailouts in 2010 and 2012 from the EU and the IMF, and after a negotiated haircut of \u20ac100 billion off its bonds, Greece was close to recovery in 2014. It had reversed the 2010 15-plus percent deficit and achieved a small primary surplus (before paying interest), reached growth after four years of recession, and even issued new bonds. However, the fiscal consolidation did not happen through spending cuts but rather through large increases in taxation, resulting in a multi-year recession. With Greeks having lost 25% of their income, and unemployment at 25%, disaffected voters brought to power a tiny, radical left party in early 2015. Following a defiant stance in early 2015, which resulted in closed banks, capital controls, reversal of growth and exclusion from money markets, the present radical left Greek government signed an onerous agreement. The agreement provided Greece a new loan of \u20ac87 billion, yet required that Greece achieve a 3.5% of GDP surplus (through more austerity) for a number of years. This target was clearly not feasible, and the Bank of Greece proposed a surplus of 1.5% to 2% of GDP. The IMF agreed with this target, and has asked the EU to restructure Greek debt obligations consistent with this target as well as for implementation of structural reforms that would make the Greek economy competitive. However, the EU has insisted on the 3.5% surplus target and painted an unrealistically rosy picture of the Greek economy to make this target appear feasible, while not pressing Greece on reforms. Greece\u2019s choice was a no-brainer: side with the IMF, have less austerity, have immediate and deep debt restructuring, and implement reforms that will make Greece more competitive and bring it out of the crisis. Instead, the Greek government sided with the EU, accepted higher austerity and less debt restructuring. Why? The Greek government wants to avoid reforming and shrinking the State because civil servants are its main block of voters. Compounding this error, the Greek government has now violated the fiscal agreement and reverted to the defiant tactics of the first half of 2015. But there\u2019s still hope. The solution to the Greek crisis is obvious and has been obvious for some time: make reforms, cut state expenditure, cut taxes, simplify investment procedures, open markets to competition, and proceed with privatizations. The present Greek government has failed in all of these dimensions. Fortunately, for Greece, a pro-reforms consensus is emerging. All opposition parties with the exception of the Communist and the Nazi party are now pro-reform. Additionally, a reformist politician, Kyriakos Mistotakis, has been elected leader of the main opposition party, center-right New Democracy, which presently has a large lead in polls. He has advocated a strictly reformist agenda. There are two additional factors that make reforms more likely to succeed now. First, the IMF fully supports the reforms and is willing to battle with the Europeans for debt restructuring, less austerity, and more reforms. Second, many Greeks, having tried everything else, now see reforms as the only way out of the crisis. Reforms and fiscal discipline is the only way for Greece to survive and prosper in the European Union. The alternative, Grexit, would plunge Greece to poverty and hyperinflation leading to a crisis a-la-Venezuela in Europe.

Trends Every Business Leader Should Watch in 2017"},"content":{"plain":"As technology and digital marketing tools continue to improve, businesses will have to adapt to trends in marketing and consumer behavior. Businesses that are attentive to the trends and changes of 2017 will be able to quickly implement new tools and strategies for greater success and improved customer interaction. Here are 15 trends and changes in products, marketing, and leadership to keep an eye on in the new year. 1. The Internet of Things In 2016, we found our smart devices to be more efficient and capable than ever. Products like Nest allow us to change the environment in our home remotely through other smart devices. In 2017, we\u2019ll continue to see advancements in sensors, software and technology that will allow our devices to be interconnected and speak to one another. Related: The Biggest News Stories That Got Us Talking In 2016 2. Green products Consumers care about corporations that are socially responsible and sustainable. The younger generation is increasingly likely to buy into companies who follow a TOMS give-back model or feature environmentally friendly products and packaging. Companies are aware that millennials are giving priority to those who are socially-conscious and are adapting their products and values accordingly. 3. Companies that connect Rather than directly selling a product, we\u2019ve seen a rise in companies looking to connect consumers with a service. Airbnb, Uber, and Trunk Club allow millennials to lead an asset-light life. The connections these companies provide help build a sense of community while consumers feel they\u2019re getting a service they need. 4. Personalized products Companies are going out of their way to touch each consumer and make products tailored to the individual. Consumers want a sense of independence and will buy from companies who value their individuality. We see examples of this trend in everything from Nike\u2019s Customizable Sneakers to Tesla allowing consumers to completely build and personalize every detail of their new automobile from scratch.

Virtual and augmented reality In 2016, virtual reality became available to consumers through products like the Oculus and Google Daydream Viewer Headset. In 2017, we\u2019ll continue to see advancements in VR and businesses will benefit in areas such as training, education, and productivity. Augmented reality is built on top of VR, with the most recent example being the Microsoft HoloLens which allows for 3D Holograms. 6. Drone technology Drones have become the must-have toy for hobbyists throughout the world. Businesses are starting to leverage the technology for enhanced customer experiences. One example worth noting is VILLAWAY, a company initiating drone property tours of vacation homes in 2017. The use of drone technology for enhanced consumer education is something we will continue to see in the future. 7. Creating a personal brand New and emerging digital platforms allow businesses and individuals to distinguish themselves from competitors by building a personal brand. This personal brand is how a business will gain individuality when marketing themselves to an audience. Social media tools such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube allow audiences to feel connected to businesses while learning about the brand values and vision. 8. Artificial intelligence In 2017, we\u2019ll see the rise of machines that can learn and complete tasks that would normally require human intelligence. We\u2019ve already caught a glimpse of machines that can problem-solve on their own, like self-driving cars. In the next year, we\u2019ll be exposed to more machines that can adapt and learn skills only we as humans have possessed thus far. You can already even request a fully autonomous Uber. 9. Remote employees As the digital space allows employees to complete work assignments from just about anywhere, more employees are seeking a flexible schedule and the comfort of working from home. Remote employees allow an employer to have access to talent all over the world. Communication tools such as Google Hangouts, FaceTime, and Skype allow employers to have face-to-face meetings with employees who are not physically present. 10. E-commerce The ease and convenience of online shopping is something consumers value, especially with perks like free same-day shipping from Amazon Prime. Social media marketing and Google Adwords make it easy for e-commerce companies to reach their target audience and ensure their ads are being seen by the eyes that matter most. 11. Fitness wearables Consumers are gravitating toward fitness wearables as new technology allows us to track what we eat, how far we walk, and what kinds of exercises we do throughout the day. Fitbit and the Nike Running App provide a competitive and gamified way for consumers to stay active and healthy. We\u2019ll likely see the release of wearables with even more intuitive software in 2017. 12. Big Data and analytics We\u2019ve seen a struggle this last year with businesses gathering misleading data. In 2017, we\u2019ll continue to see even more accurate measurements and customer data. With Facebook continually upgrading and improving analytics, companies will be able to gather even more information about consumers to inform marketing decisions. 13. Video content We\u2019ll see even more brands begin to utilize video content as VR and augmented reality become more mainstream. With the ability to share video content easily on social media through platforms like Snapchat or Facebook Live, brands are looking for new, innovative ways to capture an audience\u2019s attention through video. 14. Social media marketing Social media has become a crucial addition to every brand\u2019s marketing strategy. Platforms such as Instagram and Facebook will continue to improve ads and analytics, making it easier for brands to reach their target consumers. Social media will continue to be an important way for brands to maintain relationships and build a community of loyal customers. 15. Chatbots We\u2019ll continue to see intelligent chatbots like Siri and Alexa who can perform simple tasks and pull information. As the software improves, we\u2019ll see artificial intelligence and human characteristics used to improve the quality of information provided. We may also see chatbots that are able to learn a user\u2019s preferences and utilize those preferences when providing information. Machines will keep getting smarter and new technology will increase productivity among businesses. Remote workers and virtual tours will allow businesses to connect with consumers and employees all over the world. \u2013 Chirag Kulkarni is the co-founder of Taco and Insightfully","rendered":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EAs technology and digital marketing tools continue to improve, businesses will have to adapt to trends in marketing and consumer behavior.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EBusinesses that are attentive to the trends and changes of 2017 will be able to quickly implement new tools and strategies for greater success and improved customer interaction.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EHere are 15 trends and changes in products, marketing, and leadership t\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003Eo keep an eye on in the new year.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1.

2017 Will See Desperate Department Stores and Anxious Apparel Chains"},"content":{"plain":"It was a hard year for many retailers. Amazon.com amzn continued to run away with the e-commerce prize, and consumers, though in much better shape financially than they have been in many years, are getting increasingly bargain-hungry. The result has been declining sales at many major retailers (particularly department stores) and store closings by the hundreds. But a new year offers the industry a clean slate, whether it be a new CEO or new initiatives to break that sales skid. Indeed, 2017 will be a decisive year for many retailers, as investors will feel many have had enough time to show they can figure out a way to update how they do business in the e-commerce era. Target tgt and Kohl&#8217;s kss in particular are under pressure to show their turnarounds are still on track. Meanwhile Walmart wmt can&#8217;t let up for a second if it hopes to begin to narrow the e-commerce gap with Amazon. Department stores up and down the price spectrum are under growing pressure to show they can still be relevant and central to the shopping experience. And apparel chains have been talking for about two years about how they plan to address fast fashion and increase the quality of their products agin. 2017 promises to be a decisive year in which retailers plow ahead in the internet era and which get left behind, possibly for good. Here are the top 10 stories in Fortune will follow most closely in 2017. 1) What Will Macy&#8217;s New CEO Change? Macy&#8217;s m announced in June its long time CEO Terry Lundgren would be stepping down in 2017 and be replaced by veteran Macy&#8217;s executive Jeff Gennette. Though well regarded, he&#8217;ll have to prove that a 33-year company veteran will be up to the task of renewing the department store chain with fresh ideas at a time people are buying their clothes and beauty products elsewhere. Macy&#8217;s has been closing dozens of stores and doing everything from beefing up its wedding business to adding Apple aapl boutiques, and yet the sales declines go on. 2) Will Gap Inc Snap Its Losing Streak? The owner of Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic has reported seven straight quarters of comparable sales declines and the turnaround CEO Art Peck has been promising has been slow in coming. He is trying to make the apparel giant more nimble and better able to react to trends and increase the quality of clothes at a time consumer see apparel as a commodity. The company has managed to cut costs, and Old Navy, its biggest brand seems to be back on track, but Peck has now been in the corner office for almost two years, so any continuation of Gap Inc&#8217;s problems in 2017 will be on him. 3) Will Barnes &amp; Noble Find a CEO Who&#8217;ll Stay? Barnes &amp; Noble stunned the retail world this summer when it fired CEO Ron Boir after barely more than year, pronouncing the former Sears Canada CEO a &#8220;poor fit&#8221; with the bookseller, and dealing with its third chief executive exit in three year. So the retailer turned to founder and top shareholder Len Riggio to steer the ship while it looks yet again for a new boss. Barnes &amp; Noble got a bit of a break from the plateauing of e-books, but its online sales are in decline and its stores in need of an update. The retailer needs to show there is a room for it between Amazon.com and the resurgence of independent bookstores. 4) What Will Happen Next With Target&#8217;s Food Business? One of Target tgt CEO Brian Cornell&#8217;s big plans when he started two years ago was to fix the discounter&#8217;s food business and give it a more defined raison d&#8217;tre. But in 2016, the executive he brought in to fix the grocery business left and Cornell himself said Target had no intention of becoming a full service grocer. So that leaves unanswered questions about Target&#8217;s food strategy. Grocery is a key driver of shopper traffic and with Walmart aggressively upgrading its food areas, Target stands to lose a lot of its overall business while it figures this out. 5) Will Jet.com Send Walmart&#8217;s Online Sales Through the Roof? Walmart surprised many this summer when it shelled out $3 billion to buy Jet.com in the hopes of rejuvenating and re-igniting its online business. The retailer has added millions of items to its online assortment thanks to its marketplace overhaul and online sales growth is on the upswing again. At the same time, it remains to be seen how Jet.com itself can help Walmart&#8217;s namesake website and there is the chance for cultural clashes between the two as they integrate. 6) Will Sears Make It Through the Year? Well it should, despite itself. Sears Holdings shld has already shown us for the past decade how a retailer can hang on for a loooong time despite sharply declining sales year in, year out. But lately, Sears sales declines are getting worse and it is running out of things to sell off to maintain a cash cushion. And a new threat has emerged: J.C. Penney jcp has resumed selling appliances for the first time since 1983, taking aim at one of Sears&#8217; biggest businesses. CEO Eddie Lampert&#8217;s promised turnaround still hasn&#8217;t materialized, in fact its problems are worsening. And he&#8217;ll be able to kick the can down the road for only so much longer. 7) Can Whole Foods&#8217; New 365 Chain Win It New Shoppers? Whole Foods Market wfm opened its first low price &#8220;365&#8221; grocery stores this year and plans to ramp that up significantly with 10 more in 2017, a much bigger test for a chain meant to win the grocer derided by some as &#8220;Whole Paycheck&#8221; for its high prices more millennial shoppers. But Whole Foods will be going up against a Walmart that has spent a fortune upgrading its grocery aisles and added many fancier items. At the same time, with business slowing at its main grocery chain, Whole Foods needs 365 to be a home run. 8) Here Come More Germans! The ramped up expansion of German discount grocer Aldi in the last few years has put a ton of pressure on the likes of Walmart and Kroger kr in the competition for lower income consumers with its inexpensive, no frills stores and popular private brands. But in 2017, a brand new German rival is hitting U.S. shores: Lidl is planning to open 150 stores, with more to come later. The growing ubiquity of small format, low cost food stores threatens to upend the U.S. grocery industry and force Walmart, Whole Foods et al to really raise their game. 9) Will Luxury Department Stores Get Back on Track? Upscale retailers Neiman Marcus, Macy&#8217;s m Bloomingdale&#8217;s, Nordstrom and HBC&#8217;s hbc Saks Fifth Avenue have all had trouble this year getting people to come to their department stores. (Their outlet chains are doing fine.) Shoppers no longer want to wait nine months from when they see something at a runway to show to when they can buy it. And the internet has made it easier to comparison-shop turning even luxury items into commodities. So these chains are all investing in upgrading their stores, focusing on getting more exclusive product to win back some pricing power and seeking to quicken the product cycle to react more quickly to how younger luxe shoppers buy, rather than their older mainstay customers. 10) Can J.C. Penney Continue to Outperform Rivals? Penney has worn the Comeback Kid moniker for a couple of years now, regularly outperforming Kohl&#8217;s and Macy&#8217;s, among others in sales growth. And under CEO Marvin Ellison, the retailer has shifted the focus away from apparel, boosted its private label brands, returned to appliance sales and updated its woefully inadequate e-commerce. So far that has worked. But Penney&#8217;s comparable sales declined in the third quarter of 2016 and it has cut the long hanging fruit in its cost reductions. With Macy&#8217;s and Sears closing dozens of stores each, many malls they co-anchor with Penney will lose traffic, something that will hurt Penney. Ellison is betting the market share he will win from those rivals will more than offset sales lost to shoppers who are going AWOL at the mall.","rendered":"\u003Cp\u003EIt was a hard year for many retailers. \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ffortune.com\u002Ffortune500\u002Famazoncom-18\u002F\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EAmazon.com\u003C\u002Fa\u003E \u003Cspan class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"amzn\"\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\u003Cspan class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\"\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003Ca class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ffortune.com\u002Ffortune500\u002Famazon-com-18\u002F\"\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003Cspan class=\"ticker\"\u003Eamzn\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003Cspan class=\"change percent\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\n\t\t\t\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ffortune.com\u002F2016\u002F12\u002F02\u002Famazon-cyber-monday-2\u002F\"\u003Econtinued to run away with the e-commerce prize\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, and consumers, though in much better shape financially than they have been in many years, are getting increasingly bargain-hungry.

Just this year, GDP per capita for the Eurozone as a whole finally returned to pre-crisis levels. It is claiming victory in Spain\u2014even though unemployment remains near 20% and youth unemployment is more than twice that\u2014simply because things are better today than they have been since the euro crisis began a half decade ago. Greece remains in a severe depression. Growth for the Eurozone over the past year has been an anemic 1.6%, and that number is twice the average growth rate from 2005 to 2015. Historians are already speaking of the Eurozone\u2019s lost decade, and it\u2019s possible they\u2019ll soon be writing about its last decade, too. The euro was introduced in 2002, but the cracks in the single currency arrangement, which began in 1999, became evident with the 2008 global financial crisis. Economists had predicted that the test of the euro would occur when the region faced a shock, and Europe was unlucky in facing such a big shock coming from across the Atlantic so soon after its creation. By 2010, the euro crisis had become full blown, with interest rates on the sovereign debt of the \u201cperiphery\u201d\u2014Greece, Spain, Ireland, and Portugal\u2014soaring to unheard-of levels. But a closer look at the Eurozone shows imbalances building up from the very beginning\u2014with money rushing into the periphery countries in the misguided belief that eliminating exchange rate risk had somehow eliminated all risk. This illustrates one of the key flaws in the construction of the Eurozone: It was based on the belief that if only government didn\u2019t mess things up\u2014if it kept deficits below 3% of GDP, debt below 60% of GDP, and inflation below 2% per annum\u2014the market would ensure growth and stability. Those numbers, and the underlying ideas, had no basis in either theory or evidence. Ireland and Spain, two of the worst afflicted countries, actually had surpluses before the crisis. The crisis caused their deficits and debt, not the other way around. The hope was that fiscal and monetary discipline would result in convergence, enabling the single-currency system to work even better. Instead, there has been divergence, with the rich countries getting richer and the poor getting poorer, and within countries, the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer. But it was the very structure of the Eurozone that predictably led to this. The single market, for instance, made it easy for money to leave the banks of the weaker countries, forcing these banks to contract lending, weakening the weak further. Economists assessing the prospects of a single currency arrangement some quarter century ago emphasized the importance of sufficient labor mobility and an adequately large common budget to buffer against shocks as well as sufficient economic similarity among the countries. But the euro took away two of the critical instruments for adjustment\u2014the exchange and interest rates\u2014and didn\u2019t put anything in their place. There was no common deposit insurance, no common way of resolving problems in the banking sector, and no common unemployment insurance scheme. Equally important, these early discussions ignored the importance of intellectual convergence: There is a huge gap in perceptions of what makes for good policies, especially between Germany and much of the rest of Europe. These differences are longstanding. They were evident to me when I chaired the Economic Policy Committee of the OECD in the mid-1990s. If anything, there has been divergence here, too. Thus, the austerity policy\u2014which Germany thought should have brought a quick return to growth\u2014has failed miserably in virtually every country in which it has been tried. The consequences were predictable, and predicted by most serious economists around the world. So too, many of the particular structural reforms have actually weakened the countries on which they have been imposed, lowering growth and increasing their trade deficits. A huge democratic deficit has since opened up: citizens in Greece, Spain, and Portugal have all voted in large numbers for parties opposed to austerity. Yet, they have felt they have no choice but to accept the demands of Germany. Citizens were never told that when they joined the euro, they would be giving up their economic sovereignty. The ambition of the euro was to bring greater prosperity to Europe. This, in turn, would promote economic and political integration. The euro was a political project, but the politics weren\u2019t strong enough to create the institutional arrangements that would ensure success. With the euro leading to stagnation and worse, it is no surprise that it has led to increasing divisiveness rather than to more solidarity. Today, it seems that the euro, which was supposed to be a means to an end, has become an end in itself\u2014the pursuit of which poses perhaps the single most important threat to the European project. In response to the repeated crises, Europe has made reforms, but they have been too little, too late. Some may actually be counterproductive: Having a system of common supervision, without adequate sensitivity to local macro-conditions and without common deposit insurance may actually exacerbate divergence. Meanwhile, the region has the misfortune of being repeatedly bombarded with crises, especially the refugee crisis. With unemployment in so many countries so high\u2014at least partly because of the euro\u2014those seeking a new future wish to move to where there are jobs, resulting in a few countries bearing the brunt of the wave of migrants. And naturally, countries where unemployment is high resist having new workers competing for the scarce jobs. Europe has been engaged in brinkmanship, but the danger of brinkmanship is that there is a high probability that eventually one goes over the brink. Markets sense that the system is not viable in the long run\u2014speculators attack when they smell blood. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi\u2019s assertion that he will do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d has worked wonders\u2014for longer than anyone expected. But it is a confidence trick: It works only because market participants believe it will work. These market forces are intertwined with politics. Voters who should be unhappy\u2014simply because they have done so poorly for such a long time\u2014have expressed their anger by voting against the centrist parties of the left and right. The dissidents are in the ascendancy. &nbsp; Perhaps European leaders, sensing the urgency of the moment, will finally make the reforms in the structure of the Eurozone that will enable a single currency arrangement to work\u2014to achieve a shared prosperity. Perhaps 2017 will be the year in which the reform of the Eurozone really takes hold. In order for a single currency system to work, there has to be more Europe\u2014more solidarity; more willingness of the stronger countries to help the weaker; more willingness to create institutions like a common deposit insurance and a common unemployment scheme\u2014than the current halfway house, which is simply not viable. But the failures of the Eurozone make such reforms increasingly hard. It is at least as likely that the political forces are going in the other direction, and if that is the case, it may be only a matter of time before Europe looks back on the euro as an interesting, well-intentioned experiment that failed\u2014at great cost to the citizens of Europe and their democracies.

But a closer look at the Eurozone shows imbalances building up from the very beginning\u2014with money rushing into the periphery countries in the misguided belief that eliminating exchange rate risk had somehow eliminated all risk.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis illustrates one of the key flaws in the construction of the Eurozone: It was based on the belief that if only government didn\u2019t mess things up\u2014if it kept deficits below 3% of GDP, debt below 60% of GDP, and inflation below 2% per annum\u2014the market would ensure growth and stability. Those numbers, and the underlying ideas, had no basis in either theory or evidence. Ireland and Spain, two of the worst afflicted countries, actually had surpluses before the crisis. The crisis caused their deficits and debt, not the other way around.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe hope was that fiscal and monetary discipline would result in \u003Cem\u003Econvergence, \u003C\u002Fem\u003Eenabling the single-currency system to work even better. Instead, there has been divergence, with the rich countries getting richer and the poor getting poorer, and within countries, the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer. But it was the very structure of the Eurozone that predictably led to this. The single market, for instance, made it easy for money to leave the banks of the weaker countries, forcing these banks to contract lending, weakening the weak further.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEconomists assessing the prospects of a single currency arrangement some quarter century ago emphasized the importance of sufficient labor mobility and an adequately large common budget to buffer against shocks as well as sufficient \u003Cem\u003Eeconomic \u003C\u002Fem\u003Esimilarity among the countries. But the euro took away two of the critical instruments for adjustment\u2014the exchange and interest rates\u2014and didn\u2019t put anything in their place. There was no common deposit insurance, no common way of resolving problems in the banking sector, and no common unemployment insurance scheme.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEqually important, these early discussions ignored the importance of \u003Cem\u003Eintellectual \u003C\u002Fem\u003Econvergence: There is a huge gap in perceptions of what makes for good policies, especially between Germany and much of the rest of Europe. These differences are longstanding. They were evident to me when I chaired the Economic Policy Committee of the OECD in the mid-1990s. If anything, there has been divergence here, too. Thus, the austerity policy\u2014which Germany thought should have brought a quick return to growth\u2014has failed miserably in virtually every country in which it has been tried. The consequences were predictable, and predicted by most serious economists around the world. So too, many of the particular structural reforms have actually weakened the countries on which they have been imposed, lowering growth and increasing their trade deficits.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"p1\"\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"s1\"\u003EA huge democratic deficit has since opened up: citizens in Greece, Spain, and Portugal have all voted in large numbers for parties opposed to austerity. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003EYet, they have felt they have no choice but to accept the demands of Germany.

This, in turn, would promote economic and political integration. The euro was a political project, but the politics weren\u2019t strong enough to create the institutional arrangements that would ensure success. With the euro leading to stagnation and worse, it is no surprise that it has led to increasing divisiveness rather than to more solidarity. Today, it seems that the euro, which was supposed to be a means to an end, has become an end in itself\u2014the pursuit of which poses perhaps the single most important threat to the European project.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn response to the repeated crises, Europe has made reforms, but they have been too little, too late. Some may actually be counterproductive: Having a system of common supervision, without adequate sensitivity to local macro-conditions and without common deposit insurance may actually exacerbate divergence. Meanwhile, the region has the misfortune of being repeatedly bombarded with crises, especially the refugee crisis. With unemployment in so many countries so high\u2014at least partly because of the euro\u2014those seeking a new future wish to move to where there are jobs, resulting in a few countries bearing the brunt of the wave of migrants. And naturally, countries where unemployment is high resist having new workers competing for the scarce jobs.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEurope has been engaged in brinkmanship, but the danger of brinkmanship is that there is a high probability that eventually one goes over the brink.

By his own admission, Duterte says he is no expert on the economy and leaves it to &#8220;the bright guys&#8221; in his cabinet. Economic Planning Secretary Ernesto Pernia sees the president only twice monthly and rarely hears feedback. He said Duterte was focused almost entirely on crime and drugs. &#8220;That has been his obsession,&#8221; he told Reuters. &#8220;He essentially leaves other issues and concerns to the cabinet.&#8221; The strategy seems to have worked so far although economists are beginning to question how long it can last. &#8220;That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re hoping for, that his core economic team can prevail,&#8221; said Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI) economist Emilio S. Neri. &#8220;The fundamentals are there but we are leaning towards deficit spending and stimulus-driven growth and some unsustainable populist policies are worrisome.&#8221; At the national level, Duterte&#8217;s signature campaigns have included his tilt toward China while turning his back on long-term ally the United States in addition to the war on drugs. He rarely mentions it, but the economy has boomed under his watch, although some of the gains have been ascribed to the previous administration&#8217;s policies and Duterte&#8217;s decision to retain them. Growth reached an annual 7.1% in the third quarter of the year, Asia&#8217;s second-highest and the country&#8217;s strongest quarter in three years. The government expects full-year growth around 7%. The economy is expected to grow 6.5-7.5% in 2017, but there are worries that Duterte&#8217;s erratic behavior could impact policy, with political risk over his drugs crackdown and foul-mouthed outbursts at some big donors and investors. Markets have signaled their concern. In the six months since Duterte took over, the main stock index has lost nearly 20% in dollar terms and is among the worst performers in Asia. Over the same period, the peso currency is down around 5% to the dollar, but other currencies in the region are also depressed. DECISIVE LEADERSHIP But Duterte has plenty of supporters, who say his decisive leadership and intolerance of bad governance will be a long-term boon for the economy. In Davao City, he helped lure investors, dramatically cut red tape and fired inept officials. In 2014, Davao saw growth of a 9.3%, compared to 6.1% nationwide. Analaysts at Nomura have said his populist, development-centered approach suggests he is &#8220;strongly motivated&#8221; to address the Philippines&#8217; biggest weakness &#8211; infrastructure. Expenditure on infrastructure, including on flood management schemes, ports, a rapid-transit bus system and a rail line, makes up a quarter of next year&#8217;s record $67 billion budget. Consumer spending is strong, helped by $22 billion of remittances in the first 10 months from Filipinos overseas, a 4% rise. Unemployment was a record low 4.7% in the third quarter, from 5.7% a year earlier. &#8220;He should deserve credit,&#8221; Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez told Reuters. &#8220;Unfortunately, people are always looking at the controversial statements. But if you judge it, he has done an excellent job &#8230;the important thing is the trust and confidence of businesses in him is very high.&#8221; JITTERS Duterte&#8217;s volatility and seemingly unilateral foreign policy has caused jitters and confusion, especially when he turned hostile towards the United States and then started cosying up to China, with which the Philippines has a history of mistrust over the South China Sea. Duterte announced his &#8220;separation&#8221; from the United States in Beijing in October, shocking even his own ministers, who scrambled to assure investors &#8211; without his consent &#8211; that his policy was to diversify, not sever ties. It&#8217;s a gambit that could pay off, with an intractable dispute with Beijing now on the back burner and China pledging to provide the Philippines with billions of dollars in infrastructure loans and ramp up farm and fisheries imports. Nevertheless, economists warn that hot-headedness and willingness to take big risks could be a problem if it spills into policymaking, especially if it impacts U.S. firms, which account for three-quarters of the country&#8217;s $23 billion business-processing outsourcing (BPO) sector. Some big U.S. firms have delayed BPO investments to undergo more due diligence. Capital Economics notes a &#8220;growing risk that Duterte makes it harder&#8221; to attract big investment. Moody&#8217;s has a stable outlook, expecting &#8220;continued economic outperformance relative to peers,&#8221; assuming Duterte&#8217;s drugs war doesn&#8217;t distract him from his economic reforms. &#8220;There&#8217;s lots of focus going into the anti-drugs program,&#8221; said BPI&#8217;s Neri. &#8220;In six months, economic policy reforms seem to have taken a back seat.&#8221;","rendered":"\u003Cp\u003EAfter six months at the helm in the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte has been touting just two achievements of his presidency &#8211; a vicious war on drugs and a surprise alliance with his country&#8217;s bitter rival, China.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYet behind the curse-laden bluster and populist demagoguery that has defined Duterte&#8217;s rule, he presides over one of the world&#8217;s fastest-growing economies, and has put cabinet colleagues to work on drafting reforms and legislation to tackle the economy&#8217;s most stubborn structural problems.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAdvisers say Duterte&#8217;s economic successes come from using a strategy he honed as the long-time mayor of Davao City at a national level.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHe concentrates on busting crime and deliberately delegates the handling of the economy to others.

The e-commerce giant has been awarded a patent that describes a logistics technology it calls &#8220;airborne fulfillment center (AFC).&#8221; The AFC is essentially in airship that&#8217;s capable of flying at altitudes of 45,000 feet or more that would house items the company sells through its online marketplace. In the patent, Amazon describes a method by which drones would fly into the warehouse, pick up the items they need to deliver, and then deliver those items to the customer&#8217;s home. Amazon AMZN filed for the patent in 2014. While it was actually awarded in April, it wasn&#8217;t discovered until Wednesday by CB Insights tech analyst Zoe Leavitt. Over the last few years, Amazon has been working on drone technology through its Prime Air initiative with an aim on delivering products to customer homes without relying upon logistics companies to do it. Earlier this month, Amazon successfully completed its first drone delivery in the U.K. The company plans to expand its drone testing in 2017 in hopes of eventually relying on the unmanned aerial vehicles to deliver lightweight packages to homes. Get Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter Currently, Amazon&#8217;s drone-delivery process requires the company to erect a warehouse to serve a particular area. Inside that warehouse is a selection of lightweight products the company sells through its e-marketplace. Once a customer places an order, those items are packaged in a box the drone can carry. The drone is then outfitted with the package and delivers it to a customer&#8217;s home within 30 minutes. The potential pitfall with drones, however, is that they can only travel so far, so Amazon would technically need to erect a large number of warehouses around the world just to accommodate customers in disparate areas. But rather than look to the ground for fulfillment centers, Amazon is apparently looking to the sky. Like their grounded alternatives, the AFCs would be home to an inventory of items Amazon sells through its online marketplace, according to the patent. New items would be added to the AFC with help from a logistics shuttle that would carry products to and from the device. When an order is placed, a drone would be outfitted with the desired products and descend from the airship. It would then deliver the items to the customer. Since the drones that Amazon is testing can&#8217;t get up to heights as high as 45,000 feet, the company says its used drones will fly back to a ground installation, where they&#8217;ll be placed in a shuttle and brought back to the AFC. Amazon says the AFC concept could be a boon for handling its logistics, and pointed to its ability to move around in anticipation of demand as one of its benefits. &#8220;The use of an AFC and shuttles also provides another benefit in that the AFC can remain airborne for extended periods of time,&#8221; the company wrote in its patent description. &#8220;In addition, because the AFC is airborne, it is not limited to a fixed location like a traditional ground based materials handling facility. In contrast, it can navigate to different areas depending on a variety of factors, such as weather, expected demand, and\u002For actual demand.&#8221; For its part, Amazon hasn&#8217;t commented on the patent and did not immediately respond to a Fortune request for comment. And like other companies, Amazon often files for patents on technologies it might never bring to the market. But it&#8217;s possible that one day, Amazon drones\u2014and airships\u2014will be flying above, delivering products to folks around the globe.","rendered":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ffortune.com\u002Ffortune500\u002Famazoncom-18\u002F\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EAmazon\u003C\u002Fa\u003E might soon take flight in more ways than one.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe e-commerce giant has been awarded a \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Fpatft1.uspto.gov\u002Fnetacgi\u002Fnph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=9305280.PN.&amp;OS=PN\u002F9305280&amp;RS=PN\u002F9305280\"\u003Epatent\u003C\u002Fa\u003E that describes a logistics technology it calls &#8220;airborne fulfillment center (AFC).&#8221; The AFC is essentially in airship that&#8217;s capable of flying at altitudes of 45,000 feet or more that would house items the company sells through its online marketplace.

Her dress is just long enough to obscure her feet, so she appears to be floating across the baseline. As she strikes the ball, she tips her chin skyward and laughs in slow motion. Meanwhile, I\u2019m perched in the lotus position atop a manta ray that\u2019s hovering above the ground like some kind of Landspeeder. And I\u2019m panicking. How can I keep my balance and still hit the ball\u2014especially with my shirt collar pulling at my neck the way it is? Can\u2019t swing my racket. I jerk my head left. Then right. I claw at my jawline. The ball has cleared the net, and it\u2019s headed my way. If only. I could. Just. Move. My head. And poof. She\u2019s gone. I open my eyes in a strange room. It\u2019s pitch dark and completely silent, but I manage to find my bearings. Santa Cruz, Calif. Breathing heavily, I carefully disentangle a gaggle of wires twisted around my neck and roll over to glance at the clock. Just after 3 a.m. This scene, I now know, was merely one of 18 REM-sleep interruptions that I experienced between 11:18 p.m. and 6:16 a.m. during one long February night. What a strange setting for the only dream I\u2019ve ever had about a chief executive: in a laboratory, tethered to a byzantine apparatus designed to monitor my brain activity as well as every breath, eye movement, muscle twitch, and heartbeat. Let me explain. Like you and probably everyone you know, I\u2019ve always been confounded by my sleep routine. Why do I one morning rise ready to tackle the day and the next seem barely able to lift my head? How much rest can I be getting if I wake up sideways with the covers on the floor and my wife in the guest room? Most important, what can I do better? I don\u2019t want a magic pill. I\u2019ve tried those. I know the rules of thumb: less stress, more exercise, better diet, no afternoon caffeine, put down the damn phone. But I\u2019d kill for a personalized formula. So I subjected myself to a polysomnography test, or PSG, hoping to unravel some of the mysteries of the night. My procedure was administered in the offices of Fullpower Technologies, one floor down from where I had spent most of the evening talking with the company\u2019s founder and CEO, Philippe Kahn. A French expatriate who grew up in Paris, Kahn, 63, is a Silicon Valley oracle whose track record predates the web. He founded Borland Software (acquired by Micro Focus) MCFUF in the mid-1980s, followed by Starfish software (Motorola) and LightSurf Technologies (VeriSign) VRSN . In 1997, while anticipating the birth of his daughter, he paired a state-of-the-art Casio CSIOY camera with a Motorola Startac and became, he claims, the first person to transmit a digital photo over cellular airwaves. He\u2019s also been a leader in wearable technologies. Philippe Kahn says Fullpower is \u201coperating a huge sleep experiment unlike anything anyone has ever done.\u201dPhotograph by Ian Allen for Fortune That\u2019s precisely the focus of Fullpower, which licenses its software to other companies. Nearly five dozen framed patents for wearable-related software and devices hang on the wall in the company\u2019s lobby. The oldest dates to 2005, long before tracking steps became such a phenomenon. In the conference room there\u2019s an assembly of chairs and tables around a full-size bed, making obvious Kahn\u2019s latest obsession. Fullpower built the lab about a decade ago to capture data from sleep patterns. Of course, test subjects don\u2019t typically snooze deeply with wires glued to their skulls, chests, legs, and arms. But almost everyone manages to at least nod off for a while, and the data that subjects generate are valuable and often surprising. \u201cWhat we found early on is that sometimes you sleep less and feel more refreshed,\u201d Kahn says. \u201cIt\u2019s because you woke up in the light part of the sleep cycle.\u201d The insight led him to develop a sleep-cycle alarm that could determine the best time to alert a person within a certain window. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s better to get up at 10 of seven than at seven,\u201d he says. Kahn insists that he\u2019s on the cusp of many more such discoveries, and he\u2019s intent on dispelling some of the conventional wisdom that stresses people out. \u201cPeople say that if you can\u2019t sleep for eight hours without waking up, something\u2019s wrong with you. That\u2019s such a fallacy,\u201d he says. \u201cBefore electricity, people used to sleep in two shifts. That\u2019s how I behave. Sleep for four hours, get up and do an hour and a half of work, and then another four.\u201d He\u2019s also skeptical of the notion that a quiet room is the best environment for shut-eye and dismisses the perceived deleterious effects of repeated rousing. \u201cThe sign of good sleep hygiene may not be how many times you wake up, but rather how rapidly you fall back to sleep. Sleep should be like hunger. Eat only when you\u2019re hungry and until you\u2019re satisfied.\u201d Fullpower has oceans of data to back Kahn\u2019s theories. The company provides the sleep-tracking and activity-monitoring software for the Jawbone UP and Nike Fuel NKE wearable devices as well as a new line of Swiss-made smartwatches and the forthcoming Simmons Sleeptracker Smartbed. The products transmit a mother lode of information (with users\u2019 consent) to Kahn\u2019s team. He thinks that by combining qualitative lab data and quantitative real-world data with machine learning, artificial intelligence, and other analytics technologies, he can unlock the secrets that so many of us walking dead are looking for: a better night\u2019s sleep. \u201cWe\u2019re operating a huge sleep experiment, worldwide, unlike anything anyone has ever done,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have 250 million nights of sleep in our database, and we\u2019re using all the latest technologies to make sense of it.\u201d Kahn is not alone. He\u2019s part of a movement of brilliant entrepreneurs, data scientists, engineers, and academics who are looking at demographics, geographies, and lifestyles, and even into our genomes. They\u2019re the beneficiaries of a historic explosion in sleep data, and they\u2019re using many of the same technologies that are busily decoding some of the world\u2019s other great mysteries. Tiny sensors, big data, analytics, and cloud computing can predict machine breakage, pinpoint power outages, and build better supply chains. Why not put them to work to optimize the most valuable complex system of all, the human body? It\u2019s not an exaggeration to say lack of sleep is killing us. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls it a public health epidemic and estimates that as many as 70 million Americans have a sleep disorder. Sleep deprivation has been linked to clinical depression, obesity, Type 2 diabetes, and cancer. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that drowsy driving causes 1,550 deaths and 40,000 injuries annually in the U.S.\u2009 There are 84 sleep disorders, and some 100 million people\u201480% of them undiagnosed\u2014suffer from one of them in particular: Obstructive sleep apnea, generally indicated by snoring, costs the U.S. economy as much as $165 billion a year, according to a Harvard Medical School study. That\u2019s more than asthma, heart failure, stroke, hypertension, or drunk driving. And the study doesn\u2019t account for tangential effects, like loss of intimacy and divorce. BCC Research predicts that the global market for sleep-aid products\u2014everything from specialty mattresses and high-tech pillows to drugs and at-home tests\u2014will hit $76.7 billion by 2019. The financial upside for anyone who can crack the sleep code is obvious. And so the race is on. \u201cI believe that 15 years from now, if we do this right, we can actually tackle epidemics like obesity, diabetes, and high blood pressure, and any number of lifestyle diseases,\u201d says Kahn. \u201cWe\u2019re going to help people live longer and better lives.\u201d In 1934 this magazine ran a sprawling cover story under the simple headline \u201cSleep.\u201d Published about three decades after the dawn of sleep research, it explored a litany of the day\u2019s devices, concoctions, drugs, and homespun remedies designed, or at least purported, to help insomniacs. The article chronicled the merits of everything from Ovaltine to morphine and Barbital, a synthetic hypnotic that was used as a sleep aid until the mid-1950s despite being habit-forming and occasionally deadly. The story also unpacked the relationship between Zalmon G. Simmons and Harry M. Johnson. Simmons was the president of the eponymous company his father founded, which has by now sold nearly 100 million mattresses, most notably under the Beautyrest brand. Johnson was a psychology professor at Ohio State who was conducting sleep research on the side. At the time, old Zalmon was looking to solve two problems: He needed to sell more mattresses. And he needed sleep. The head of the iconic mattress maker was an insomniac! So he gave Johnson $25,000 to set up a sleep lab at the university now known as Carnegie Mellon. At the time it was believed that normal sleepers lay motionless throughout the night. Johnson collected 2.5 million data points from 160 subjects and demonstrated the folly of that theory. Normal sleepers, he determined, change positions from 20 to 85 times a night, with 35 being a sort of sweet spot. When we toss and turn more, we wake up groggy; any less, and we\u2019re stiff and sore. (The insight would pay dividends for Simmons, the company. Spurred by the revelation that proper sleep required movement, it became the first to introduce king and queen-size mattresses. Unfortunately, Zalmon didn\u2019t solve his personal problem. His insomnia devolved into depression and, in the words of the article, his \u201cfortune began to wobble. Soon after that, sleep ceased to be a problem. For Zalmon G. Simmons was dead.\u201d) Those movements are what enable today\u2019s wearable devices to monitor sleep. Gartner Group IT projects sales of 36 million smart wristbands, a category that includes most Fitbit FIT devices, Jawbone UP, and Nike Fuel, in 2015 and 2016. Fitbit is definitely king. NPD Group estimates that it has an 85% market share. Fitbit raised $732 million in a highly anticipated IPO stoked by the impressive metrics revealed in its S-1 filing: nearly $132 million in net income on $745 million in revenue last year, with $336 million in revenue in the first quarter of this year. Fitbit has sold more than 21 million devices since 2008 and has 9.5 million active users. That means Fitbit is gathering far more data in one night than Johnson did in his career. Thanks to its sleep-monitoring technology, the company can distinguish among variations in movements and has determined that the majority of its users actually wake up between three and 17 times a night\u20149.3 times being average. Most awakenings are short and probably not remembered. Fitbit\u2019s data suggest that the number of awakenings drops with age until about 45, and then remains flat. Men under 50 have, on average, one more awakening per night than women of the same age, but the discrepancy largely disappears after 50. Fitbit\u2019s research team developed the algorithms to gather and analyze all these data under the guidance of Shelten Yuen. Yuen, 36, who has a Ph.D. in engineering sciences, has worked in missile defense and has done research in surgical robotics. He was approached by Fitbit\u2019s co-founders back in 2010 to write the software underlying the wearable device they were envisioning. \u201cCrazy sensor thing?\u201d Yuen remembers thinking. \u201cThat\u2019s my deal.\u201d He signed on as employee No. 4. \u201cWe need to take the veil off of sleep,\u201d says Shelten Yuen, who leads Fitbit\u2019s research team and wrote the original software that tracks Fitbit users\u2019 movement and sleep.Photograph by Ian Allen for Fortune The first goal for Fitbit was tracking steps. Yuen figured it would be a snap\u2014until he realized that a regular accelerometer can\u2019t distinguish between a wrist that\u2019s moving with a walking gait and a wrist that\u2019s, say, shoveling food. He delivered what he thought was the perfect device. \u201cThey said, \u2018Did you try scratching your head? Did you put it in your pocket? How about strapped to a bra?\u2019 Suddenly it became a crazy, phenomenally hard problem,\u201d he remembers. Steps are easy compared with sleep. For starters, what\u2019s the difference between an absence of movement while trying to sleep and actual sleep? Wearables are beginning to incorporate heart-rate monitoring, which helps correlate sleep stages, but they don\u2019t measure respiration or neural activity like a polysomnograph and so rely more heavily on inference. Fitbit encounters skepticism from users, including me, about the accuracy of its sleep measurement. Yuen admits he hasn\u2019t achieved perfection, but he largely brushes off the incredulity, saying it stems from the fact that our instincts for how well we\u2019re sleeping don\u2019t typically match reality. For steps, users can monitor their progress, but not so with sleep. (For his part, Kahn insists that he has the formula for maximum accuracy: He says his huge quantity of rock-solid polysomnography data and wristband sleep-tracking information have helped him develop an algorithm that adjusts for the imperfections of wristband data.) Whatever the accuracy of Fitbit\u2019s data, the company has a ton of it, and is seeing some interesting patterns. Yuen calls one of his data scientists, Jacob Arnold, 31, into the conference room at Fitbit headquarters in San Francisco\u2019s South of Market neighborhood. Arnold also has a Ph.D., his in astronomy and astrophysics. Together they unveil some graphs demonstrating that people around the world get more sleep in winter and less in summer. Daylight clearly has an effect on sleep patterns; temperature might too. We sleep less on the hottest day of the year than on the longest day. The data show that the longest average duration of sleep usually occurs on the weekend following New Year\u2019s Day. Yuen also makes it clear that getting a lot of sleep is not equivalent to having a restful night. Yuen and Arnold then reveal a graph demonstrating that, statistically speaking, no one gets less sleep than the demographic group to which I belong, forty-something males. I\u2019m not sure how to take the news. Is it a body blow or a hopeful sign of more rest in my future? Establishing the norm the way these charts do is an important step from a scientific standpoint. But to be indispensable in the marketplace, Fitbit needs to empower users with real guidance. \u201cWe need to take the veil off of sleep,\u201d says Yuen. \u201cWe need to make this data much more understandable so they don\u2019t feel powerless.\u201d Fitbit co-founder and CEO James Park echoes the sentiment. Some analysts are predicting that fitness trackers have peaked, especially because of the launch of the Apple Watch (which doesn\u2019t track slumber because it needs to be charged every night). Park knows that if he can help his customers sleep better, Fitbit will become irreplaceable. \u201cA lot of clinical studies show that certain behaviors might affect sleep: light levels, noise levels, caffeine, time of exercise,\u201d says Park. \u201cThe next step is to tie prescriptive elements into it. That\u2019s one of the big opportunities for this category. Can companies actually deliver coaching services to help people sleep that consumers actually want to pay for?\u201d Not long after meeting Steve Kay, dean of the Dornsife school of arts and sciences at the University of Southern California, I notice he\u2019s wearing a Fitbit. Curious about what kind of a sleeper one of the world\u2019s leading experts in circadian rhythm would be, I ask how he\u2019d fared the night before. He looks at the app on his phone. \u201cI went to bed at a quarter past 11 and got up at 20 past four,\u201d he says with a shake of the head. Count Kay among the many of us getting less rest than we need. I\u2019m in Kay\u2019s conference room with Ross Bersot, a venture partner at Bay City Capital turned entrepreneur. Bersot, 40, and Kay, 53, are a latter-day Zalmon Simmons and Harry Johnson. A few years ago, Kay published research demonstrating that it\u2019s possible to isolate and manipulate the speed of an organism\u2019s circadian rhythm using molecular compounds. Bersot provided funding to Kay\u2019s lab in hopes of potentially starting a company based on more detailed findings. That company, Reset Therapeutics, is now real and based in the Bay Area. Like Fullpower and Fitbit, Reset is intent on getting to the heart of the nature of sleep. But while others duke it out for wrist real estate, Reset is going deep into our bodies with a different set of tools. It\u2019s pairing Kay\u2019s research with the latest advances in genomics and high-throughput screening, and partnering with personal-genetics startup 23andMe to try to develop a drug that can manipulate our circadian rhythm. Almost every living thing on earth has an internal clock\u2014or more accurately, a symphony of clocks ticking away at the cellular level\u2014that tells its owner when to rest and when to produce. It\u2019s not just humans. Monsanto recently published a paper demonstrating that it could boost soybean yields 5% by tweaking one of the plant\u2019s clock-associated genes. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to help them figure out why,\u201d says Kay, whose lab is working with Monsanto. \u201cAnd all the major ag and biotech companies are interested. When you\u2019re a plant stuck in the ground, everything is circadian. Biomass, yield, response to extreme temperatures\u2014it\u2019s all clock regulated.\u201d Human clocks are equally powerful, but we aren\u2019t quite as enslaved by them because we don\u2019t depend on photosynthesis. By some estimates, up to 70% of us live in spite of our internal clocks, or in the scientific jargon, outside our chronotype. Your chronotype predisposes you to being a night owl or a morning person or even being hungry at certain times, and many of us are guilty of ignoring our chronotypes, whether because of our lifestyle or just the call of duty. When we live largely out of sync with our chronotypes, we experience everything from grogginess and reduced productivity to digestion issues, weight gain, and accelerated aging. We also increase our risk of obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Kay cites studies that link such lifestyles to an increased rate of breast cancer. \u201cWe evolved to adapt on this planet that has periods of light and dark. But modern life is really clashing with that,\u201d he says. \u201cThe key is being internally synchronized. Your sleep-wake cycles, your food-intake cycles, your metabolic cycles are all working together. When they\u2019re out of sync, that\u2019s when (a) you feel lousy, and (b) you start seeing the disturbance of all kinds of markers. Sleep efficiency collapses. Leptin plummets. Insulin goes up.\u201d Reset wants to tweak our clocks with a drug. Such a drug would help reset the chronotypes of people who choose or need to live a different lifestyle or whose clocks are impaired. For now the development phase is limited to two so-called orphan diseases, narcolepsy\u2014a neurological disorder that causes significant daytime sleepiness and in some cases cataplectic attacks\u2014and Cushing\u2019s disease, a neuroendocrine disorder characterized by excess blood sugar, obesity, and pituitary tumors. Working with orphan diseases enables the company to help people sooner and get on the fast track to regulatory approval. \u201cWith the Cushing\u2019s program, we\u2019re focused on a protein that makes a clock run at a 24-hour cycle,\u201d says Bersot. And so far, so good: \u201cWe\u2019re restoring the rhythms to a 24-hour period, and in our early work with animals, we\u2019ve seen blood glucose and insulin levels return to normal as a result.\u201d Reset plans to take the Cushing\u2019s drug to clinical trials next year and the narcolepsy treatment after that. Bersot hopes that once the drug establishes its ability to reset the body clock for sufferers of those diseases, Reset will develop it more broadly as a sleep aid for shift workers and anyone else whose clock and lifestyle are misaligned. In the meantime the company is working with 23andMe to explore correlations between chronotypes and various genetic expressions. According to Emily Drabant Conley, 23andMe\u2019s director of business development and a Ph.D. in neuroscience, 80% of 23andMe\u2019s customers allow their genotypes to be used in research. She\u2019s scouring their files in hopes of finding correlations between genotypes and sleep-related survey data. For example, how do people of a given genetic expression most commonly answer these questions: How many hours of sleep do you average? Do you snore? Do you take sleep medication? \u201cSleep is interesting because it\u2019s not like eye color, where you have only five choices. Having a lot of data that you can mine is important,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we\u2019re just at the beginning. We\u2019ve done the first pass at the genetics of being a morning person. We know that genetics plays a role in whether you need six hours or eight hours. The prescriptive aspect will come.\u201d It\u2019s a common refrain, and despite the way it may sound to someone yearning for rest, it\u2019s hardly a cop-out. In the realm of data science there\u2019s a commonly accepted notion of how progress occurs. First comes descriptive analytics, next predictive analytics, and finally prescriptive analytics. In other words, describe the system, predict outcomes based on those descriptions, and prescribe actions to attain desired outcomes. To the layperson, prescription may sound like the most difficult phase, but in reality the hardest part is often where we are today, measuring and mapping behavior just to get to the point where it\u2019s conceivable to predict behavior and prescribe actions. Science is clearly advancing in the quest to understand sleep. We\u2019re adding data in quantities that were unimaginable even a decade ago, much less during the time that Fortune first considered the subject. Big Pharma and biotech companies are drilling into our genomes to find links between DNA and nighttime routines; they\u2019re also exploring medications that adjust the circadian rhythm. Wearable-device companies are casting nets far and wide. Fitbit recently enabled its devices to track sleep automatically, rather than as a user-triggered behavior, and some of its devices now monitor heart rate, which helps Yuen and Arnold make finer distinctions between lack of motion and restful sleep. Full-power just entered a partnership with Simmons to provide sleep-tracking technology for the mattress maker\u2019s new Sleeptracker Smartbed, which will provide noninvasive sleep-monitoring technology and is scheduled to hit the market in 2016. On top of all this, scientists around the world are using cheap wearables to conduct their own exploratory research. A quick search of Google Scholar shows dozens of wearable-powered experiments and papers detailing the efforts to unravel the mysteries of the night. All of which will\u2014one day soon, let\u2019s hope\u2014translate to a more personalized analysis and formula for how each of us can get a better night\u2019s sleep. Which brings me back to my night in Fullpower\u2019s sleep lab. A few days after my test I received a PSG report that shines a light on my own personal darkness. The prognosis was mixed. The good news: My sleep-efficiency score was a robust 93.5%\u2014\u201cYou should be proud of that,\u201d says Kahn\u2014which means that most of the time I\u2019m in bed, I\u2019m sleeping. And I\u2019m quick. I drifted off in 2.5 minutes, even with all those wires attached. The bad: I snored. In fact, I was diagnosed with \u201cmild to moderate\u201d apnea. That officially makes me part of the $165 billion problem. I was advised to see a doctor. That\u2019s not the prescription I was looking for. I\u2019m not crazy about doctors, and I\u2019m afraid of being persuaded to buy a machine that I won\u2019t use. So for now, I think I\u2019ll just keep trying to do what I know to be right. Exercise. Keep a consistent routine. Restrict the hours that I eat, try to lay off the junk food and booze, and hope that before long someone will offer me a more personalized regimen. Until then, I\u2019ll always have the memory of a laughing, volleying Marissa Mayer and the knowledge that together, on one strange night in Santa Cruz, we\u2014and whatever caused my 17 other REM interruptions\u2014slept, or at least tried to, in the name of progress.

The article chronicled the merits of everything from Ovaltine to morphine and Barbital, a synthetic hypnotic that was used as a sleep aid until the mid-1950s despite being habit-forming and occasionally deadly. The story also unpacked the relationship between Zalmon G. Simmons and Harry M. Johnson. Simmons was the president of the eponymous company his father founded, which has by now sold nearly 100 million mattresses, most notably under the Beautyrest brand. Johnson was a psychology professor at Ohio State who was conducting sleep research on the side.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"p2\"\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"s3\"\u003EAt the time, old Zalmon was looking to solve two problems: He needed to sell more mattresses. And he needed sleep. The head of the iconic mattress maker was an insomniac! So he gave Johnson $25,000 to set up a sleep lab at the university now known as Carnegie Mellon. At the time it was believed that normal sleepers lay motionless throughout the night. Johnson collected 2.5 million data points from 160 subjects and demonstrated the folly of that theory. Normal sleepers, he determined, change positions from 20 to 85 times a night, with 35 being a sort of sweet spot. When we toss and turn more, we wake up groggy; any less, and we\u2019re stiff and sore. (The insight would pay dividends for Simmons, the company. Spurred by the revelation that proper sleep required movement, it became the first to introduce king and queen-size mattresses. Unfortunately, Zalmon didn\u2019t solve his personal problem. His insomnia devolved into depression and, in the words of the article, his \u201cfortune began to wobble. Soon after that, sleep ceased to be a problem. For Zalmon G.

The battle over the battle of Obamacare repeal comes to a sort-of head today as both President Obama and Vice President\u2013elect Mike Pence march to Congress to shore up their respective troops. The pep talks won\u2019t change much. Like some staged Civil War reenactment, both sides will initially hurl themselves at each other with their rhetorical Bowie knives and revolvers. But the real fight will almost certainly slog on for months, as Kelsey Snell and Mike DeBonis have reported in the Washington Post. In terms of procedure, one oft-mentioned strategy is for Republican Congressional leaders (who have only a slim majority in the Senate) to use a convoluted parliamentary workaround called \u201cbudget reconciliation\u201d to strip away the financial circuitry and plumbing of the Affordable Care Act, even as they leave the legislative framework standing. Think of that approach as marauders rushing into a new construction project and absconding with all the electrical wiring and copper pipes. But there have been increasing cries\u2014including late yesterday from the American Medical Association, the influential guild for U.S. physicians\u2014not to dismantle the existing, if flawed, Affordable Care Act before settling upon a replacement. Even some diehard Obamacare antagonists, such as Sen.

And this bill keeps the provisions that Donald Trump says he wants to keep\u2014and that millions of American voters want to keep\u2014like those that prevent insurers from blacklisting people with preexisting medical conditions and that allow parents to include their slacker twentysomething kids on their own policies. And natch, this legislation has mechanisms that makes sure there\u2019s an intact marketplace of insurers, and that people aren\u2019t freeloading off of the hefty premiums paid by hardworking Americans: This is a conservative plan, after all. Sure, some will scoff and say it looks an awful lot like Obamacare. But it\u2019s nothing like it. This bill, for instance, has a rock-ribbed Republican name.

Europe&#8217;s largest automaker has pledged billions to compensate U.S. owners of Volkswagen (VW) diesel-powered cars, but has so far rejected any compensation for the 8.5 million affected vehicles in Europe where different legal rules weaken the chances of affected customers winning a pay out. Instead, VW is in the process of removing the illicit software that cheated emissions tests and insists the technical fixes will inflict no loss of value on car owners in Europe. It hopes to have completed repairs to all affected vehicles by the end of the year. MyRight, which has gathered more than 100,000 VW owners through its website, has accused VW of breaching European Union law by selling cars with software that was banned under EU rules, according to the 93-page legal document seen by Reuters. Rather than seeking compensation for a decline in value, the lawsuit aims to force VW to repurchase the vehicles at the original price, myRight founder Jan-Eike Andresen said. MyRight has mandated U.S. law firm Hausfeld to pursue the claims. Hausfeld represents aggrieved VW owners and shareholders on both sides of the Atlantic. The purpose of the proceedings by myRight is to act as a model &#8211; resolving generic or common issues for other related cases. However, unlike in a U.S. class action, it does not have the legal effect of resolving all individual claims. To read Fortune&#8217;s in-depth account of the Volkswagen scandal, click here.

The lawsuits have not yet been made available to us which is why we cannot comment on the contents at the moment,&#8221; the carmaker said. VW is already facing criminal investigations in Germany on the suspicion that it misled investors by withholding knowledge of the diesel scandal for over a year. The company&#8217;s stock fell by more than a third when it finally disclosed the scale of its legal problems with the Environmental Protection Agency and California Air Resource Board.

He said Ford would have made the same decision even if Trump had not been elected.\r\n\r\nFord will cancel plans unveiled in April to spend $1.6 billion to build the new plant in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, a project Trump urged the automaker to abandon and called an \"absolute disgrace\" during the election campaign.\r\n\r\nThe No. 2 U.S. automaker also said it would invest $700 million to expand the Flat Rock, Michigan factory and would make new electric, hybrid and autonomous vehicles there.\r\n\r\nTrump's efforts to browbeat the U.S. car industry show he may go further than other modern presidents to try to influence corporate decisions, especially those related to trade and investment.\r\n\r\nIn a Twitter post hours before Ford's announcement, Trump wrote, \"General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!\" GM, the largest U.S. automaker, said making some of the Cruze cars in the plant in Coahuila, Mexico was part of its strategy to serve global customers, not sell those vehicles in the United States.\r\n\r\nTrump's GM tweet was his latest broadside aimed at an American company over jobs, imports and costs even before he takes office on Jan. 20.\r\n\r\nMexico's government said it regrets Ford's decision and has ensured that the company will reimburse San Luis Potosi state for any costs associated with the investment.\r\n\r\n\"Obviously, this isn't a good decision for us,\" said Mexico's economy minister, Ildefonso Guajardo.\r\n\r\nFord said it still will shift production from Michigan of its Focus compact car to an existing plant in Hermosillo, Mexico. Fields said he expects Michigan to give incentives for Ford's investment in Flat Rock.\r\n\r\nFord spokeswoman Jennifer Flake said the automaker will save $500 million by not opening the new plant in the near term, but will have some undisclosed costs to retool the other Mexican plant to build the Focus.\r\n\r\nFord shares closed up about 3.8 percent. GM shares rose about 0.9 percent.\r\n\r\n\u003Cstrong\u003ETRUMP NOTIFIED\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\r\n\r\nTop Ford executives personally notified Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence of their decision. Fields praised tax and regulatory proposals advocated by Trump and his fellow Republicans who control Congress.\r\n\r\n\"Our view is that we see a more positive U.S. manufacturing business environment under President-elect Trump and the pro-growth policies and proposals that he's talking about, so this is a vote of confidence for President-elect Trump and some of the policies that they may be pursuing,\" Fields said.\r\n\r\nUnion workers gathered at the Flat Rock factory cheered Fields' announcement. Hiring of the 700 new workers there will probably start in 2018 with the majority of it in 2020, Fields said.\r\n\r\nTrump said during the presidential campaign that if elected he would not allow Ford to open the new plant in Mexico and would slap hefty tariffs on imported Ford vehicles. Trump also accused Mexico of sending criminals and rapists into the United States and vowed to build a border wall to combat illegal immigration.\r\n\r\nSince winning the Nov. 8 election, Trump has targeted a wide range of American companies also including [f500link]United Technologies[\u002Ff500link] Inc, [f500link]Boeing[\u002Ff500link] Co and [f500link]Lockheed Martin[\u002Ff500link] Corp. Trump also has touted decisions by companies to keep some production in the United States, including United's Carrier unit in Indiana.\r\n\r\nTrump previously vowed to hit companies that shift production from America to other countries with a 35 percent tax on their exports into the United States. He also has denounced the North American Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Mexico and Canada.\r\n\r\nFields said there were no negotiations between Ford and the incoming president over canceling the Mexico plant or investing in Michigan.\r\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align:center;\"\u003E[fortune-brightcove videoid=5269310978001]\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\r\nFord will build a battery electric SUV with a 300-mile (482-km) driving range at the Michigan plant by 2020, and will launch production there by 2021 of a fully autonomous vehicle without a steering wheel or a brake pedal for use in ride services fleets. Ford also plans new hybrid versions of its F-150 pickup truck, Mustang and police vehicles by 2020.\r\n\r\nGM said it sold about 190,000 Cruze cars in the United States in 2016. All of the sedan versions sold in the United States, about 185,500, were built at its Lordstown, Ohio plant. About 4,500 hatchback Cruze versions were assembled in Mexico and sold in the United States.\r\n\r\n\u003Cem\u003EThis story has been updated.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","title":"Ford Cancels a $1.6 Billion Mexico Plant and Adds 700 Jobs in Michigan"},"video":null,"structured":null}],"fortune:primary_tag":[{"term_id":58962834,"name":"broadsheet","slug":"broadsheet-2","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":112680,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":626,"filter":"raw"}],"fortune:primary_section":[{"term_id":20466,"name":"Careers","slug":"careers","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":46729,"taxonomy":"category","description":"News you can utilize to develop and advance your career and how to position yourself to get that great new job.

While Germany generally avoids punitive legal settlements against companies, the sheer numbers involved create a material risk for VW: some 8 million cheating cars were sold in Europe, compared to only 600,000 in the U.S.. Owners have claimed they have suffered losses through lower resale values andhigher fuel bills. German law doesn\u2019t allow class actions.

He said Ford would have made the same decision even if Trump had not been elected.\r\n\r\nFord will cancel plans unveiled in April to spend $1.6 billion to build the new plant in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, a project Trump urged the automaker to abandon and called an \"absolute disgrace\" during the election campaign.\r\n\r\nThe No. 2 U.S. automaker also said it would invest $700 million to expand the Flat Rock, Michigan factory and would make new electric, hybrid and autonomous vehicles there.\r\n\r\nTrump's efforts to browbeat the U.S. car industry show he may go further than other modern presidents to try to influence corporate decisions, especially those related to trade and investment.\r\n\r\nIn a Twitter post hours before Ford's announcement, Trump wrote, \"General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!\" GM, the largest U.S. automaker, said making some of the Cruze cars in the plant in Coahuila, Mexico was part of its strategy to serve global customers, not sell those vehicles in the United States.\r\n\r\nTrump's GM tweet was his latest broadside aimed at an American company over jobs, imports and costs even before he takes office on Jan. 20.\r\n\r\nMexico's government said it regrets Ford's decision and has ensured that the company will reimburse San Luis Potosi state for any costs associated with the investment.\r\n\r\n\"Obviously, this isn't a good decision for us,\" said Mexico's economy minister, Ildefonso Guajardo.\r\n\r\nFord said it still will shift production from Michigan of its Focus compact car to an existing plant in Hermosillo, Mexico. Fields said he expects Michigan to give incentives for Ford's investment in Flat Rock.\r\n\r\nFord spokeswoman Jennifer Flake said the automaker will save $500 million by not opening the new plant in the near term, but will have some undisclosed costs to retool the other Mexican plant to build the Focus.\r\n\r\nFord shares closed up about 3.8 percent. GM shares rose about 0.9 percent.\r\n\r\n\u003Cstrong\u003ETRUMP NOTIFIED\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\r\n\r\nTop Ford executives personally notified Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence of their decision. Fields praised tax and regulatory proposals advocated by Trump and his fellow Republicans who control Congress.\r\n\r\n\"Our view is that we see a more positive U.S. manufacturing business environment under President-elect Trump and the pro-growth policies and proposals that he's talking about, so this is a vote of confidence for President-elect Trump and some of the policies that they may be pursuing,\" Fields said.\r\n\r\nUnion workers gathered at the Flat Rock factory cheered Fields' announcement. Hiring of the 700 new workers there will probably start in 2018 with the majority of it in 2020, Fields said.\r\n\r\nTrump said during the presidential campaign that if elected he would not allow Ford to open the new plant in Mexico and would slap hefty tariffs on imported Ford vehicles. Trump also accused Mexico of sending criminals and rapists into the United States and vowed to build a border wall to combat illegal immigration.\r\n\r\nSince winning the Nov. 8 election, Trump has targeted a wide range of American companies also including [f500link]United Technologies[\u002Ff500link] Inc, [f500link]Boeing[\u002Ff500link] Co and [f500link]Lockheed Martin[\u002Ff500link] Corp. Trump also has touted decisions by companies to keep some production in the United States, including United's Carrier unit in Indiana.\r\n\r\nTrump previously vowed to hit companies that shift production from America to other countries with a 35 percent tax on their exports into the United States. He also has denounced the North American Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Mexico and Canada.\r\n\r\nFields said there were no negotiations between Ford and the incoming president over canceling the Mexico plant or investing in Michigan.\r\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align:center;\"\u003E[fortune-brightcove videoid=5269310978001]\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\r\nFord will build a battery electric SUV with a 300-mile (482-km) driving range at the Michigan plant by 2020, and will launch production there by 2021 of a fully autonomous vehicle without a steering wheel or a brake pedal for use in ride services fleets. Ford also plans new hybrid versions of its F-150 pickup truck, Mustang and police vehicles by 2020.\r\n\r\nGM said it sold about 190,000 Cruze cars in the United States in 2016. All of the sedan versions sold in the United States, about 185,500, were built at its Lordstown, Ohio plant.

Stock investors have long looked to January to tell them where the market might be headed for the rest of the year. And for good reason: Over the long haul, the-first-month-of-the-year indicator has seemed to work pretty well. Historically, stocks have tended to rise in January. And in general, when stocks were up at the end of January, eleven months later shares logged a positive year; when January was down, shares ended the year in the red. Only 27% of the time since 1929 have the market and January parted ways, according to data from Standard &amp; Poor&#8217;s. That seems like good news for 2017 (based on a very small sample size). The Dow Jones industrial average rose 119 points on Tuesday, or 0.6%, on the first trading day of 2017. Let the good times roll. The problem: Recently, the market connection between January and the rest of the year has been pretty lousy. During the past 11 years, stocks as measured by the S&amp;P 500 have fallen six times in January. Yet the market has ended down in only two of those six years. The divergence was particularly big last year. In 2016, the market had its worst start of the year since 1896, which Reuters, at the time, noted was seven years before the Wright brothers took flight and 12 years before Ford began selling the Model T. (On Tuesday, Ford scrapped plans to move some of its car production to Mexico.) The market ended the first month of last year down just over 5%. Nonetheless, in part thanks to the Trump Bump, 2016 ended up being a pretty good year for stocks, up 9.5%. Overall, the last few years have resulted in a lot of false negatives and false positives for the January indicator. And 2016 wasn&#8217;t the only year of big divergence. In 2009, for instance, the market dropped more than 8% in the first 31 days of the year. By March, though, the market was rebounding from the financial-crisis slump, and stocks ended that year up nearly 24%. In 2015, the January indicator worked, but just barely. Stocks fell 3% in January, but ended the year down just 1%. Erase January, and stocks were actually up the other 11 months of that year. Not exactly the bloodbath that January would have predicted. Even the first order January Effect\u2014that stocks tend to rise in January\u2014hasn&#8217;t been bankable lately. Again, of the past 11 years, only five have had up Januarys. What&#8217;s going on? One answer could have to do with index funds. More and more money has been shifting into passive investing\u2014funds that blindly track an index. Active fund managers typically sell some stocks in December either to lock in positive returns for the year, or to realize losses (for tax purposes), and then go on a buying spree in January. In the past, that in turn may have created momentum for the stock market for the rest of the year (or at least for a few months), as emotion-driven humans reacted to the spree and dove into the stock market, not wanting to miss out. Index investing, in contrast, lacks those behavioral quirks. Jeff Rubin, the director of research at investment firm Birinyi Associates, believes the January effect has waned because the January trade became too predictable. In order to capture the month&#8217;s gains, more investors have been buying stocks in December, leaving fewer left to buy in January. What&#8217;s more, the growing degree of market timing around the first 31 days of the year made January&#8217;s gains or losses an increasingly poor representation of how people actually thought about stocks or the economy. &#8220;The more people who pile into any trade, the less it works,&#8221; says Rubin. Another answer could be that in an era of historically low interest rates, the stock market, except for the disastrous 2008, has generally been up. Yes, Januarys in which the stock market has risen have been good predictors\u2014five out of the past five have coincided with up years. But, as a post on stock blog Seeking Alpha points out, that&#8217;s because the market has gone up in nine of the past 11 years. There are a number of better-than-average reasons to doubt the predictive powers of this January&#8217;s results, if stocks do finish the month with gains. The biggest is President-elect Donald Trump: Actions he may take to stymie global trade, for example, could hobble stocks. Add to that the fact that the Federal Reserve has indicated that it plans more interest rate increases this year. What&#8217;s more, as my colleague Shawn Tully writes this week, it looks likely that Wall Street&#8217;s big bet on soaring earnings could be a fantasy. So stocks could continue to rise in January, even past Dow 20,000, as investors remain on a Trump high. But don&#8217;t let that fool you. January&#8217;s ability to predict the stock market&#8217;s future is weaker than ever.","rendered":"\u003Cp\u003EJanuary appears to have less of a pull on the market than it used to.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EStock investors have long looked to January to tell them where the market might be headed for the rest of the year.

This combination, atypical for tacos, have led to doubts whether the concoction Jack in the Box cooks up even is a taco.

Clayton is a partner at Sullivan &amp; Cromwell who specializes in public and private mergers and offerings, an area that requires expertise on complex securities regulations and corporate governance. Clayton was not available to comment. He met with President-elect Donald Trump on Dec. 22 and appears to have overtaken a former U.S. Attorney, Debra Wong Yang, whose name had been floated as a top candidate in early December. Yang declined to comment. Clayton&#8217;s name surfaced relatively recently and he is one of a handful of other top contenders.

But not all are keen to connect with systems developed by Apple or Google. Ford Motor f and Toyota Motor tm have formed a consortium to accelerate the deployment of open source software aimed at giving consumers more options in how they connect and control their smartphone apps. The organization is called the SmartDeviceLink (SDL) Consortium, a reference to an open source software version of Ford&#8217;s AppLink. Mazda Motor mzday , PSA Group, Fuji Heavy Industries fujhy , and Suzuki Motor szkmy , are the first automaker members of the consortium. Suppliers Elektrobit ebttf , Harman har , Luxoft lxft , QNX, and Xevo have also joined the nonprofit organization. Get Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter. The formation of the consortium follows Toyota&#8217;s announcement last January that it planned to use the SDL software in its cars to give drivers command and control of smartphone apps through dashboard buttons, display screens, and voice recognition tech. Toyota plans to commercialize an infotainment system using SDL around 2018. The unusual agreement between the typically competitive companies showed the wariness of some automakers to hand over control to third-party companies\u2014namely Apple aapl and Google googl . Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are two connectivity systems that allow a smartphone to take over a car\u2019s center screen. Once users plug their smartphones into the car\u2019s USB ports, the phones&#8217; maps and navigation, music, and selected apps are integrated onto the central screen. Ford and Toyota argue that an open source code is a better approach, because developers and automakers working together can increase the quality and security of the software. If the industry adopts the software, developers would gain access to millions of vehicles and their drivers worldwide, while participating companies would still be able to retain control over the level of access outside parties have to vehicle data, the companies said. Ford has abandoned Apple&#8217;s and Google&#8217;s offerings, however. The company has taken an all-of-the-above approach to connectivity in the car.

During an interview with Bloomberg Television on Tuesday, Summers said that the global economy was entering a period of &#8220;extraordinary uncertainty,&#8221; with the possibility of protectionist measures and unprecedented changes to foreign policy looming. \u201cThis is probably the largest transition ideologically and in terms of substantive policy that we\u2019ve seen in the U.S. in the last three quarters of a century,\u201d Summers said. \u201cThose kinds of transitions have to be\u2014given the central role of the U.S. in the global system\u2014matters of enormous uncertainty.

In a tweet, Trump voiced continued skepticism about the extent of Russia&#8217;s cyber hacking. He and top advisers believe Democrats are trying to delegitimize his Nov. 8 election victory by accusing Russian authorities of helping him. &#8220;The &#8216;Intelligence&#8216; briefing on so-called &#8216;Russian hacking&#8217; was delayed until Friday, perhaps more time needed to build a case. Very strange!&#8221; Trump tweeted. It was not clear when the briefing originally had been scheduled to take place. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Get Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter. Trump, who has cast doubt on U.S. intelligence agencies&#8217; conclusion that Russia hacked Democratic Party computers, said over the weekend he would discuss the hacking allegations on Tuesday or Wednesday. With his tweet, he suggested he would not address the subject until he had been briefed by intelligence officials. Trump has scheduled a Jan. 11 news conference in New York. He is expected to discuss separating himself from his far-flung business empire, and other topics, including Russia, are likely to come up. U.S. intelligence officials have said they are confident Russia was behind the hacks of political figures in an effort to help Trump win the presidential election. For more on cybersecurity and the incoming White House administration, watch Fortune&#8217;s video: President Barack Obama retaliated to the hacking last week by ordering 35 Russian intelligence officials expelled from the United States and two Russian compounds shut down. Trump told reporters on Saturday at his Palm Beach, Florida, resort that he knew &#8220;things that other people don&#8217;t know&#8221; about the hacking, &#8220;so we cannot be sure&#8221; who was responsible. He said any computer was subject to hacks. &#8220;It&#8217;s very important. If you have something really important write it out and have it delivered by courier the old fashioned way,&#8221; Trump said, adding: &#8220;No computer is safe, I don&#8217;t care what they say.&#8221;","rendered":"\u003Cp class=\"p1\"\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"s1\"\u003EPresident-elect Donald\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"s2\"\u003E Trump \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"s1\"\u003Esaid on Tuesday that a briefing he is to receive from U.S.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"s2\"\u003E intelligence \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"s1\"\u003Eofficials on allegations of Russian hacking of the U.S. election had been delayed until Friday.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"p1\"\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"s1\"\u003EIn a tweet,\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"s2\"\u003E Trump \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"s1\"\u003Evoiced continued skepticism about the extent of Russia&#8217;s cyber hacking.

Investors Are Betting On Samsung\u2019s Best Quarterly Profit in 3 Years"},"content":{"plain":"Samsung Electronics ssnlf is likely to forecast its best quarterly profit in nearly three years on Friday, analysts said, with robust memory chip sales easing the pain of the costly failure of a flagship smartphone. The South Korean firm discontinued sales of the Galaxy Note 7 phones after some of the devices caught fire, warning of a $2.1 billion hit to its profit in the fourth quarter of 2016 due to expenses tied to an ongoing global recall and lost sales. But investors are betting a surge in sales of memory chips and organic light-emitting diode screens for smartphones will translate to strong earnings growth for the October-December period and through 2017. Samsung&#8217;s operating profit likely rose for a second straight quarter to 8.4 trillion won ($7 billion) over October-December, according to a Thomson Reuters StarMine SmartEstimate derived from a survey of 15 analysts, up 37% from a year ago and the highest since the first quarter of 2014. &#8220;We look for the memory business to post a big earnings improvement and contribute 50% of its (Samsung&#8217;s) total operating profit for Q416,&#8221; Daiwa said in a report. Memory chip prices have spiked recently on demand for more firepower on mobile devices. But it is the sales of the higher-end 3D NAND chips which have rallied significantly, helping Samsung rake in profits given it is ahead of its rivals such as Toshiba tosbf and SK Hynix in the mass production of these chips, analysts said. For more on Samsung, watch Fortune&#8217;s video: Samsung&#8217;s semiconductor profit likely surged to a record 4.5 trillion won for the fourth quarter and 13.1 trillion won for 2016, Eugene Investment said in a report, adding chip earnings will grow further this year on firm demand. HDC Asset Management&#8217;s fund manager Park Jung-hoon agreed that the components business outlook appeared &#8220;pretty solid.&#8221; &#8220;We&#8217;ll have to see how the mobile business does &#8230; but I think Samsung&#8217;s operating profit should be able to come in somewhere around mid-30 trillion won range (this year).&#8221; For the recently ended quarter, Samsung&#8217;s mobile earnings likely rebounded from the dismal third quarter on healthy sales of the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge smartphones, analysts said.

The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said the payments also resolve charges that TransUnion and Equifax lured consumers into enrolling in credit services advertised as free or costing only $1, but which could cost more than $200 a year. TransUnion will reimburse $13.93 million to consumers and pay a $3 million civil fine, while Equifax will reimburse $3.8 million and pay a $2.5 million civil fine, the CFPB said. Both companies will also modify their marketing practices, including by obtaining consent to enroll in credit-related services where fees kick in after free trials, and making it easier for consumers to cancel products they do not want. The CFPB said the wrongful conduct had occurred at TransUnion since July 2011 and at Equifax between July 2011 and March 2014, and violated the Dodd-Frank financial reform law. Many lenders rely on credit scores from TransUnion, Equifax and rival Experian experian-plc when lending money. But the CFPB said TransUnion and Equifax falsely represented that the credit scores they sold to consumers were the same scores that lenders used. &#8220;Credit scores are central to a consumer&#8217;s financial life and people deserve honest and accurate information about them,&#8221; CFPB Director Richard Cordray said in a statement. For more on credit report companies, watch Fortune&#8217;s video: Neither Chicago-based TransUnion nor Atlanta-based Equifax admitted or denied wrongdoing. TransUnion spokesman David Blumberg and Equifax spokeswoman Ines Gutzmer said their respective companies believe they have complied with applicable laws, and are committed to better educating consumers about their credit.

Cancels a $1.6 Billion Mexico Plant and Adds 700 Jobs in Michigan"},"content":{"plain":"Ford Motor Co f on Tuesday scrapped a planned Mexican car factory and added 700 jobs in Michigan following criticism by Donald Trump, as the U.S. president-elect turned his attention toward rival General Motors Co with the threat of a &#8220;big border tax&#8221; over compact cars made in Mexico. Ford CEO Mark Fields called the move &#8220;a vote of confidence&#8221; in Trump, but primarily a response to a decline in North American demand for small cars like those that would have been made at the Mexican plant. He said Ford would have made the same decision even if Trump had not been elected. Ford will cancel plans unveiled in April to spend $1.6 billion to build the new plant in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, a project Trump urged the automaker to abandon and called an &#8220;absolute disgrace&#8221; during the election campaign. The No. 2 U.S. automaker also said it would invest $700 million to expand the Flat Rock, Michigan factory and would make new electric, hybrid and autonomous vehicles there. Trump&#8217;s efforts to browbeat the U.S. car industry show he may go further than other modern presidents to try to influence corporate decisions, especially those related to trade and investment. In a Twitter post hours before Ford&#8217;s announcement, Trump wrote, &#8220;General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!&#8221; GM, the largest U.S. automaker, said making some of the Cruze cars in the plant in Coahuila, Mexico was part of its strategy to serve global customers, not sell those vehicles in the United States. Trump&#8217;s GM tweet was his latest broadside aimed at an American company over jobs, imports and costs even before he takes office on Jan. 20. Mexico&#8217;s government said it regrets Ford&#8217;s decision and has ensured that the company will reimburse San Luis Potosi state for any costs associated with the investment. &#8220;Obviously, this isn&#8217;t a good decision for us,&#8221; said Mexico&#8217;s economy minister, Ildefonso Guajardo. Ford said it still will shift production from Michigan of its Focus compact car to an existing plant in Hermosillo, Mexico. Fields said he expects Michigan to give incentives for Ford&#8217;s investment in Flat Rock. Ford spokeswoman Jennifer Flake said the automaker will save $500 million by not opening the new plant in the near term, but will have some undisclosed costs to retool the other Mexican plant to build the Focus. Ford shares closed up about 3.8 percent. GM shares rose about 0.9 percent. TRUMP NOTIFIED Top Ford executives personally notified Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence of their decision. Fields praised tax and regulatory proposals advocated by Trump and his fellow Republicans who control Congress. &#8220;Our view is that we see a more positive U.S. manufacturing business environment under President-elect Trump and the pro-growth policies and proposals that he&#8217;s talking about, so this is a vote of confidence for President-elect Trump and some of the policies that they may be pursuing,&#8221; Fields said. Union workers gathered at the Flat Rock factory cheered Fields&#8217; announcement. Hiring of the 700 new workers there will probably start in 2018 with the majority of it in 2020, Fields said. Trump said during the presidential campaign that if elected he would not allow Ford to open the new plant in Mexico and would slap hefty tariffs on imported Ford vehicles. Trump also accused Mexico of sending criminals and rapists into the United States and vowed to build a border wall to combat illegal immigration. Since winning the Nov. 8 election, Trump has targeted a wide range of American companies also including United Technologies Inc, Boeing Co and Lockheed Martin Corp. Trump also has touted decisions by companies to keep some production in the United States, including United&#8217;s Carrier unit in Indiana. Trump previously vowed to hit companies that shift production from America to other countries with a 35 percent tax on their exports into the United States. He also has denounced the North American Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Mexico and Canada. Fields said there were no negotiations between Ford and the incoming president over canceling the Mexico plant or investing in Michigan. Ford will build a battery electric SUV with a 300-mile (482-km) driving range at the Michigan plant by 2020, and will launch production there by 2021 of a fully autonomous vehicle without a steering wheel or a brake pedal for use in ride services fleets. Ford also plans new hybrid versions of its F-150 pickup truck, Mustang and police vehicles by 2020. GM said it sold about 190,000 Cruze cars in the United States in 2016. All of the sedan versions sold in the United States, about 185,500, were built at its Lordstown, Ohio plant.

Third-Party Sellers Had Record-Breaking Sales in 2016"},"content":{"plain":"Amazon.com amzn shipped 50 percent more items this holiday season than last for third-party vendors and doubled the amount for 2016 overall, the retail giant said on Wednesday. The news offers new data points for investors who are hoping Amazon will post a profit for the fourth quarter when it announces results in the coming weeks. Seattle-based Amazon, known for its roller coaster results in years past, has forecast that operating income would range from nothing to $1.25 billion. Amazon, the world&#8217;s largest online retailer, has said the 2016 holiday was its best-ever shopping season. However, high spending on warehouses and video production are expected to drag on profits. More sellers are paying the company to store, pack and ship their goods through the Fulfillment by Amazon service. Amazon more than doubled the items it delivered for other sellers in 2016 from the year prior to exceed two billion, a spokesman said. Active sellers using the fulfillment service rose more than 70 percent in the year, Amazon said on Wednesday. It did not specify the total number of vendors. &nbsp; Third-party sales were &#8220;record-breaking&#8221; in 2016, Peter Faricy, vice president for Amazon Marketplace, said in the statement. Amazon takes a cut of the proceeds. Amazon will likely top its profit-margin guidance for the fourth quarter, Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy said in a research note last week. Price competition seemed subdued in December and Amazon avoided delivery bottlenecks it experienced in 2015, he said. Cyber Monday, a shopping spree four days after Thanksgiving, is another indicator. Shoppers ordered more than 28 million items from third-party sellers this year, versus more than 23 million items on Cyber Monday in 2015, Amazon said. Amazon is building its own fleet of planes to handle the rise in orders and supplement shipping that it contracts out to companies like FedEx Corp and United Parcel Service Inc . Data reviewed by Reuters and interviews with airport officials show that Amazon has loaded these aircraft with big but lightweight boxes, helping it dodge fees from cargo carriers increasingly pricing based on volume rather than weight.

integration between cars and smartphones. But not all are keen to connect with systems developed by Apple or Google. Ford Motor f and Toyota Motor tm have formed a consortium to accelerate the deployment of open source software aimed at giving consumers more options in how they connect and control their smartphone apps. The organization is called the SmartDeviceLink (SDL) Consortium, a reference to an open source software version of Ford&#8217;s AppLink. Mazda Motor mzday , PSA Group, Fuji Heavy Industries fujhy , and Suzuki Motor szkmy , are the first automaker members of the consortium. Suppliers Elektrobit ebttf , Harman har , Luxoft lxft , QNX, and Xevo have also joined the nonprofit organization. Get Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter. The formation of the consortium follows Toyota&#8217;s announcement last January that it planned to use the SDL software in its cars to give drivers command and control of smartphone apps through dashboard buttons, display screens, and voice recognition tech. Toyota plans to commercialize an infotainment system using SDL around 2018. The unusual agreement between the typically competitive companies showed the wariness of some automakers to hand over control to third-party companies\u2014namely Apple aapl and Google googl . Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are two connectivity systems that allow a smartphone to take over a car\u2019s center screen. Once users plug their smartphones into the car\u2019s USB ports, the phones&#8217; maps and navigation, music, and selected apps are integrated onto the central screen. Ford and Toyota argue that an open source code is a better approach, because developers and automakers working together can increase the quality and security of the software. If the industry adopts the software, developers would gain access to millions of vehicles and their drivers worldwide, while participating companies would still be able to retain control over the level of access outside parties have to vehicle data, the companies said. Ford has abandoned Apple&#8217;s and Google&#8217;s offerings, however. The company has taken an all-of-the-above approach to connectivity in the car.

Investors Are Betting On Samsung\u2019s Best Quarterly Profit in 3 Years"},"content":{"plain":"Samsung Electronics ssnlf is likely to forecast its best quarterly profit in nearly three years on Friday, analysts said, with robust memory chip sales easing the pain of the costly failure of a flagship smartphone. The South Korean firm discontinued sales of the Galaxy Note 7 phones after some of the devices caught fire, warning of a $2.1 billion hit to its profit in the fourth quarter of 2016 due to expenses tied to an ongoing global recall and lost sales. But investors are betting a surge in sales of memory chips and organic light-emitting diode screens for smartphones will translate to strong earnings growth for the October-December period and through 2017. Samsung&#8217;s operating profit likely rose for a second straight quarter to 8.4 trillion won ($7 billion) over October-December, according to a Thomson Reuters StarMine SmartEstimate derived from a survey of 15 analysts, up 37% from a year ago and the highest since the first quarter of 2014. &#8220;We look for the memory business to post a big earnings improvement and contribute 50% of its (Samsung&#8217;s) total operating profit for Q416,&#8221; Daiwa said in a report. Memory chip prices have spiked recently on demand for more firepower on mobile devices. But it is the sales of the higher-end 3D NAND chips which have rallied significantly, helping Samsung rake in profits given it is ahead of its rivals such as Toshiba tosbf and SK Hynix in the mass production of these chips, analysts said. For more on Samsung, watch Fortune&#8217;s video: Samsung&#8217;s semiconductor profit likely surged to a record 4.5 trillion won for the fourth quarter and 13.1 trillion won for 2016, Eugene Investment said in a report, adding chip earnings will grow further this year on firm demand. HDC Asset Management&#8217;s fund manager Park Jung-hoon agreed that the components business outlook appeared &#8220;pretty solid.&#8221; &#8220;We&#8217;ll have to see how the mobile business does &#8230; but I think Samsung&#8217;s operating profit should be able to come in somewhere around mid-30 trillion won range (this year).&#8221; For the recently ended quarter, Samsung&#8217;s mobile earnings likely rebounded from the dismal third quarter on healthy sales of the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge smartphones, analysts said. Hyundai Securities expects Samsung&#8217;s mobile division&#8217;s operating profit at 2.2 trillion won, in line with a year earlier and up sharply from 99 billion won in July-September. The company&#8217;s shares hit a record 1.831 million won on Tuesday this week ahead of the earnings forecast on Friday. They surged 43% in 2016\u2014the most since 2012\u2014suggesting investors did not expect a serious business impact from Samsung&#8217;s name being dragged into a growing political scandal in the country.","rendered":"\u003Cp\u003ESamsung Electronics \u003Cspan class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"ssnlf\"\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\u003Cspan class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\"\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003Ca class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\u002Fcompany\u002Fssnlf\u002F\"\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003Cspan class=\"ticker\"\u003Essnlf\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003Cspan class=\"change percent\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\n\t\t\t\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E is likely to forecast its best quarterly profit in nearly three years \u003Cspan class=\"aBn\"\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"aQJ\"\u003Eon Friday\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E, analysts said, with robust memory chip sales easing the pain of the costly failure of a flagship smartphone.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe South Korean firm discontinued sales of the Galaxy Note 7 phones after some of the devices caught fire, warning of a $2.1 billion hit to its profit in the fourth quarter of 2016 due to expenses tied to an ongoing global recall and lost sales.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut investors are betting a surge in sales of memory chips and organic light-emitting diode screens for smartphones will translate to strong earnings growth for the October-December period and through 2017.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESamsung&#8217;s operating profit likely rose for a second straight quarter to 8.4 trillion won ($7 billion) over October-December, according to a Thomson Reuters StarMine SmartEstimate derived from a survey of 15 analysts, up 37% from a year ago and the highest since the first quarter of 2014.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&#8220;We look for the memory business to post a big earnings improvement and contribute 50% of its (Samsung&#8217;s) total operating profit for Q416,&#8221; Daiwa said in a report.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMemory chip prices have spiked recently on demand for more firepower on mobile devices.

The Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported on Tuesday, when Tokyo markets were closed, that the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission would present allegations of accounting fraud to prosecutors, who had previously declined to investigate due to a lack of evidence. The watchdog found that Toshiba had reported profit gains in its computer operations during the 2012-2014 financial years, when the section had not generated any profit, the newspaper reported, citing unidentified sources. Toshiba&#8217;s two CEOs and a chairman at the helm of the company during that period were involved in the alleged cheating, it added. The investigation could open the way to formal criminal charges against the company and its former executives. Officials at Toshiba were not immediately available for comment.

Xerox&#8217;s sibling business services unit, Conduent, spun off into a separate company on Tuesday. It must now find a way to lift its growth amid stagnant sales and a tough market. Xerox acquired the roots of Conduent, which handles everything from human resources services for healthcare companies to mobile parking apps for the city of Los Angeles, by buying Affiliated Computer Services for nearly $6.4 billion in 2010. The deal was supposed to help Xerox find another source of revenue beyond it&#8217;s core copier and printing business. But like other big business tech companies like IBM and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Xerox&#8217;s overall revenue has declined in recent years. With few people printing and copying, Xerox&#8217;s annual sales have dropped each year since 2011. During much of that time, Xerox&#8217;s business services group struggled. In a nine-month period ending in September, Conduent had $4.9 billion in revenue, or nearly flat compared to the previous year. Xerox&#8217;s executives say that two smaller, more nimble businesses will be able to better adapt to a rapidly changing technology world. The argument echoes that of Hewlett Packard, which split into two companies last year. But Wall Street didn&#8217;t exactly give Conduent a happy birthday. In its first day of trading, the company&#8217;s shares fell 8% to $13.72. In this edited interview with Fortune, Conduent CEO Ashok Vemuri talks about splitting from Xerox xrx , competing with IBM ibm and HPE hpe , and new beginnings. Fortune: Tell me about splitting from Xerox. Vemuri: If you go back six to seven years when Xerox acquired a company called ACS [Affiliated Computer Services] in 2010, the thesis of that acquisition was that Xerox was a hardware manufacturing company. This was during a recession, and management thought the best would be to serve your clients soup-to-nuts, if you will, by acquiring a services company. It was very similar to other companies\u2014think Dell with Perot [$3.9 billion deal was announced in 2009], HP with EDS [$13.9 billion deal was announced in 2008] That construct of combining hardware with services didn\u2019t necessarily pan out. So, it was thought that our two companies would be better served if they were sliced off and were allowed to control their own destiny and serve their own clients, their own market, their own technology, etc. Get Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter. Why did hardware companies think that they also had to have business services? It was the height of the recession. This was considered a sort of natural hedge in terms of buying revenue. Secondly, it was believed that if you sold a piece of equipment to a client, they were servicing that equipment with somebody else. So why would I not, if I sold you that equipment, service it instead? Thirdly, services companies were on the ascendancy. Remember, even 10 years ago, print, paper, ink was on decline, and it continues to be so. The services business is where the margins are\u2014where the cash flow is\u2014and your need for spending is much less. If you look at an equipment provider like Xerox, it\u2019s more a finance operating lease company, because they fund your purchase of a printer. A services business is asset light. It does not require you to invest your balance sheet in a big way. Some analysts believe the downside of a service company, however, are the costs of hiring employees, which can eat into profitability. That\u2019s wrong. That is the conventional way of thinking about services businesses. In our model, 80% of our business is transactions based. We do everything off the back of technology. That allows me to add a multitude of services off a particular platform. Let me give you an example. If I have three or four clients, I cannot repurpose my people because they aren\u2019t fungible. I can\u2019t say, \u201cHey, for two hours you be on the call center, for two hours you do transaction processing, for two hours you work for Client A, and for two hours you work for Client B.\u201d But I can do it if I do it on the back of technology, because my platform aggregates and creates air pockets that allow me to work for multiple clients. I can repurpose my platform to do multiple functions. With people, I can\u2019t expect them to work more than eight hours. What are the services that your company does? We serve two broad segments. One is the public sector. We work with all 50 U.S. states and over 500 government entities worldwide. We do a lot of work in transportation. Think about parking: You use a parking app pay over the phone, and the phone reminds you after 45 minutes to pay more We are now handling road tolls\u2014so think EasyPass in California and SunPass in Florida. We are the world\u2019s largest prepaid card processor. We do things like welfare, Social Security, Food Stamps. The other part of the business is commercial. We work with 74 of the top Fortune 100 companies. We support them on mission-critical systems. Apple aapl co-founder Steve Jobs once publicly criticized Xerox for not capitalizing on its technology. Correct. In a similar way, a lot of Conduent\u2019s technology was invented in Xerox over the last six years. The ACS story is six years old; a little is left, but a lot of that is new and a lot of that was invented in Xerox. Now that you\u2019re an independent company, how do you balance spending on research into new technologies with pleasing investors? Clearly today, technology is at a place where you don\u2019t necessarily have to build components in-house; you can buy them from others. We have to rid ourselves of the sensibility we\u2019ve had that if it\u2019s not invented in-house it\u2019s not worth looking at. We are now a public company, so our research dollars have to give a return in the year that I give the dollar in, unlike in the past in which the time to yield was like five to seven years. Having said that, technology will be the underpinning of every process we bring. Therefore we must invest in our technology platform and make it modern. The speed of technology is changing and the way it is being consumed is dramatically changing in such a short time frame that our investments have to reflect that time horizon as well as the fact that these changes are happening. Who are your biggest competitors? We are in a wide range of industries, so we have a lot of them. A lot of them are very niche and specialized companies. Across our various businesses, we see as competitors like Accenture, we see IBM, we see HPE. My advantage is I\u2019m a pure-play business process provider. I\u2019m the largest in revenue and in size and scale. For more about enterprise technology, watch: How do you distinguish yourselves from the big business services groups of companies like IBM that may brag that their technology separates them from the pack? Technology is a commodity. I can buy technology every other day at half the price I paid the day before yesterday. The technology product isn\u2019t going to give you any differentiation. What gives you differentiation is what you do with that technology. If I understand processes and have functional and domain knowledge, then I can actually leverage that technology and literally make it jump through hoops to provide me the answer or the outcome that the business really needs.","rendered":"\u003Cp\u003EIt&#8217;s a new beginning for Xerox&#8217;s spawn.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EXerox&#8217;s sibling business services unit, Conduent, spun off into a separate company on Tuesday.

The services business is where the margins are\u2014where the cash flow is\u2014and your need for spending is much less.

The French cosmetics and beauty giant this week will debut a connected smart hairbrush called the Krastase Hair Coach at CES 2017 in Las Vegas. The device is a brush that comes with sensors that L&#8217;Oreal promises will measure the quality of a user&#8217;s hair as well as the effects of different hair care routines. The gadget will retail for &#8220;under $200&#8221; and will be available this fall at Krastase hair salons as well as online. &#8220;We really want to think about what the connected bathroom will look like in the future for the beauty industry,&#8221; Guive Balooch, VP of L&#8217;Oreal&#8217;s Technology Incubator, told Fortune in an interview. The Krastase Hair Coach\u2014with technology powered by Nokia-owned Withings\u2014features a microphone (which listens to the sound of brushing to identify patterns); an accelerometer and a gyroscope (to analyze brushing patterns and count brush strokes); and sensors (to determine if the the brush is being used on dry or wet hair). Via connection with an app, the brush can tell a user how how often hair is brushed\u2014and also warn consumers if they are brushing too hard. The brush vibrates to warn against over brushing. Balooch says the brush also gives a user a daily hair breakage score\u2014by measuring the overall quality of the hair. The device then provides tips based on the user&#8217;s hair type and brushing behavior (and of course, makes a few helpful recommendations for Krastase beauty products). &#8220;It will basically be your hair coach,&#8221; Balooch said. &#8220;When you brush you hair, it will do a good job to make sure your hair is smooth.&#8221; The smart hairbrush is the latest device from L&#8217;Oreal as the beauty behemoth behind Garnier, Maybelline and Kiehl&#8217;s thinks about how it can infuse technology into those well-established consumer brands. L&#8217;Oreal itself set up an internal, tech-focused startup several years ago in Silicon Valley and has recently made investments in external digital and technology startups. One of the incubator&#8217;s first products, a stretchable skin sensor designed to monitor ultraviolet light exposure called My UV Patch, debuted at CES last year. Of course, all this raises the obvious question: do bathrooms across the globe really need a &#8220;smart&#8221; hairbrush? Most can likely live without it\u2014but at CES, a slew of Internet-connected home devices debut each year as inventors envision a world where sensors invade more aspects of our day-to-day lives. The idea is that data from these sensors can improve or lives. Many of these devices are increasingly targeting the home\u2014L&#8217;Oreal is specifically focusing on the bathroom. Balooch says his team&#8217;s goal is to hone in on real needs and provide data and information to improve a consumer&#8217;s routine. Hair breakage is a top beauty concern for women as it relates to their hair\u2014so helping them avoid split ends is a need that L&#8217;Oreal thinks it can meet with the smart hairbrush. L&#8217;Oreal says the goal is for the app and device to work as simply as possible. &#8220;It needs to connect to something they already have in their day-to-day routine,&#8221; Balooch said. When it comes to L&#8217;Oreal&#8217;s CES product debuts, it also must comb through the company&#8217;s deep bench of brands to figure out what makes most sense for the branding name to attach to the technology. Dermatological skincare brand La Roche-Posay got the nod for last year&#8217;s My UV Patch, while for 2017, hair care products brand Krastase was selected because it has a luxurious connotation among consumers.","rendered":"\u003Cp\u003EL&#8217;Oreal thinks your hairbrush could be a little smarter.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe French cosmetics and beauty giant this week will debut a connected smart hairbrush called the Krastase Hair Coach at CES 2017 in Las Vegas.

How Nokia Plans to Invest in Smart Devices"},"content":{"plain":"Nokia made a splash at CES 2017 with help from its smart home subsidiary Withings. The Finnish phone maker on Tuesday announced a few new devices that it says will help its Withings brand, which Nokia NOK acquired in May 2016 for an undisclosed sum, continue to compete in the smart devices market. Chief among those announcements was the new Withings Home Plus, a smart HD camera that can not only record what&#8217;s happening in the home, but also receive notifications in the event of an unusual noise, monitor indoor air quality, and keep a watchful eye on a baby with its baby-monitoring feature. Withings Home Plus can also stream video to a user&#8217;s smartphone. Get Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter The Home Plus is designed to work with Withings&#8217; own mobile-monitoring app for Android and iOS, but Nokia was quick to point out that the camera is one of the first of its kind to support Apple&#8217;s HomeKit, a service that lets third-party companies integrate control over their products into Apple&#8217;s Home app. The Home app lives on iOS and acts as a central hub for users to control the many smart devices throughout the home. Nokia says that its Withings Home Plus will be available to customers in the first quarter for $199. In addition to the camera, Nokia said that it&#8217;s improving its Withings line of products with the release on Jan. 4 of the Withings Steel HR activity tracker. The Steel HR can track a wearer&#8217;s health by seeing how far they&#8217;ve walked and what kinds of activities they&#8217;ve engaged in, like playing basketball, soccer, or even boxing. The Steel HR can also track heart rate. For more about Nokia, watch: Because the Steel HR is designed to be more than an activity tracker, Nokia says the Withings wearable is also a timepiece with an analog-style watch face to help folks tell time. It integrates with an Android smartphone goog or iPhone aapl to deliver smartphone notifications. The Steel HR will be available 36mm and 40mm sizes, and will retail for a starting price of $200. Nokia says it&#8217;ll initially be on sale through its Withings online store, and will then find its way to retail stores in mid-January.

The Facebook fb CEO and Fortune\u2019s pick for 2016\u2019s Businessperson of the Year, said Tuesday that he plans to visit roughly 30 states in 2017\u2014presumably ones where he&#8217;s never been before\u2014to achieve the goal of meeting with people in every U.S. state. The interstate road trip is Zuckerberg\u2019s latest annual personal challenge that he undertakes for personal growth. Last year, Zuckerberg built for his home a crude-version of Amazon&#8217;s popular voice-controlled digital assistant Alexa that can turn on house lights and play music on command. He&#8217;s also pledged in past years to learn Mandarin Chinese, eat only meat from animals that he personally killed, and read a new book every other week. Get Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter. Zuckerberg said that his new personal challenge would help him \u201cget out and talk to more people about how they&#8217;re living, working and thinking about the future\u201d in light of a \u201ctumultuous last year,\u201d which he did not elaborate on. This is a popular theme, particularly following Donald Trump&#8217;s unexpected ascendancy to president and the feeling among some elites that they have lost touch with a large swath of America. For more about Facebook, watch: Here\u2019s Zuckerberg\u2019s full post via Facebook: Every year I take on a personal challenge to learn new things and grow outside of my work. In recent years, I&#8217;ve run 365 miles, built a simple AI for my home, read 25 books and learned Mandarin. My personal challenge for 2017 is to have visited and met people in every state in the US by the end of the year. I&#8217;ve spent significant time in many states already, so I&#8217;ll need to travel to about 30 states this year to complete this challenge. After a tumultuous last year, my hope for this challenge is to get out and talk to more people about how they&#8217;re living, working and thinking about the future. Priscilla and I have enjoyed taking road trips together since we started dating. Recently, I&#8217;ve traveled around the world and visited many cities, and now I&#8217;m excited to explore more of our country and meet more people here. Going into this challenge, it seems we are at a turning point in history. For decades, technology and globalization have made us more productive and connected. This has created many benefits, but for a lot of people it has also made life more challenging. This has contributed to a greater sense of division than I have felt in my lifetime. We need to find a way to change the game so it works for everyone. My work is about connecting the world and giving everyone a voice. I want to personally hear more of those voices this year. It will help me lead the work at Facebook and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative so we can make the most positive impact as the world enters an important new period.\u201d My trips this year will take different forms &#8212; road trips with Priscilla, stops in small towns and universities, visits to our offices across the country, meetings with teachers and scientists, and trips to fun places you recommend along the way.

Rather Is Right, the Media Should Call Trump\u2019s Lies What They Are"},"content":{"plain":"What should the media do when the U.S. president says something that is clearly and unequivocally not true? This might have seemed like an academic ethical question in the past, but with business mogul Donald Trump set to move into the Oval Office soon, it has become much more pressing, and more than a little contentious. During a weekend interview on Meet the Press that included both New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet and Wall Street Journal editor Gerard Baker, the latter was asked whether he thought inaccurate statements by Trump should be specifically called out as lies. Baker said that he didn&#8217;t think so, because the word &#8220;lie&#8221; implies that the person told an untruth on purpose. Instead, the Journal editor argued that media outlets should simply present the facts and leave it up to readers to determine the truth. The word lie &#8220;implies much more than just saying something that&#8217;s false. It implies a deliberate intent to mislead,&#8221; Baker said. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s up to the reader to make up their own mind&#8230; If you start ascribing a moral intent, as it were, to someone by saying that they&#8217;ve lied, I think you run the risk that you look like you\u2019re not being objective.&#8221; Get Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter. Legendary news anchor Dan Rather, however, took issue with this approach in a post on his Facebook page that was widely shared among journalists. Rather called Baker&#8217;s argument &#8220;deeply disturbing.&#8221; It is not the proper role of journalists, the former anchor said, &#8220;to meet lies \u2014 especially from someone of Mr. Trump\u2019s stature and power \u2014 by hiding behind semantics and euphemisms. Our role is to call it as we see it, based on solid reporting. When something is, in fact, a demonstrable lie, it is our responsibility to say so.&#8221; In his NBC interview, Baker referred to Trump&#8217;s repeated statements that Muslims were seen cheering in New Jersey when the World Trade Center towers fell. The Journal reported that there was no evidence this had actually occurred, Baker said, and then left it to the reader to decide. But even if the standard principle is that something can only be called a lie if we know the intent of the speaker\u2014as the Journal editor argues it should be\u2014can we not assume that Trump was making those statements with a deliberate intent to mislead voters about Muslim behavior? After all, he said it multiple times, even after it had been proven false. The same thing goes for many other Trump statements on a wide range of issues. He has repeatedly said that millions of people voted illegally, which isn&#8217;t true, and that ending the &#8220;stop and frisk&#8221; campaign in New York increased crime, which it didn&#8217;t. There are literally hundreds of such examples. At what point does repeating them stop being a falsehood and become an outright lie? In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally &mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2016 Baker&#8217;s argument is very similar to the one made by moderators like Fox News host Chris Wallace and MSNBC host Chris Matthews during the presidential debates. Wallace said he didn&#8217;t think it was a moderator&#8217;s job to be a &#8220;truth squad,&#8221; while Matthews said calling out lies would be equivalent to expressing an opinion, which journalists shouldn&#8217;t do. Those comments came up in large part because Matt Lauer of NBC was widely criticized for failing to challenge Trump during an interview when the candidate claimed that he never supported the war in Iraq, despite abundant evidence to the contrary. In a Twitter debate on Monday with a number of journalists, including Fusion writer Felix Salmon and former New York Observer editor Elizabeth Spiers, Time Inc.&#8217;s chief content officer Alan Murray (who is also editor of this magazine) defended Baker&#8217;s approach, saying journalists should be careful about using the word &#8220;lie&#8221; without proof that the speaker deliberately intended to mislead. Words matter. &quot;False&quot; and &quot;lie&quot; are not the same thing. https:\u002F\u002Ft.co\u002FACM5exCej2 &mdash; Alan Murray (@alansmurray) January 3, 2017 Spiers and others, however, said journalists make intelligent inferences about a politician&#8217;s motives all the time, and catching one in a lie is no different. Former Fortune writer Dan Primack, who is now with the media startup Axios, said: &#8220;I agree about being careful. But if you can prove the shoe fits, then put it on.&#8221; Washington Post writer Greg Sargent argued that &#8220;Donald Trump lies. A lot. And news organizations should say so.&#8221; These are all of Trump&#8217;s potential conflicts of interest: Inaccurate statements aren&#8217;t always lies. As Murray pointed out, Ronald Reagan said a lot of things that turned out not to be true, but not all of them were lies. But he didn&#8217;t repeatedly tell the same untruths over and over in the face of all the available evidence, the way Trump has done throughout his campaign, behavior he will presumably continue once he is in office. How can a self-respecting journalistic organization not call those lies? In the kind of broken media landscape we currently have, something Trump took advantage of better than anyone else during the campaign, not calling out obvious lies risks providing him with the headlines he wants\u2014apparently reinforcing his questionable claims\u2014with the evidence against his statements buried in the lower parts of a story that no one will read.","rendered":"\u003Cp\u003EWhat should the media do when the U.S. president says something that is clearly and unequivocally not true?

Almost immediately, digital security experts panned the story, criticizing it as prematurely alarmist and lacking key details. The supposed discovery linked &#8220;code&#8221; found on the utility&#8217;s computer network to Russian election meddlers, who were widely believed to be Kremlin-sponsored and associated with state security and intelligence agencies such as the FSB and GRU. The finding came a day after the government published an intelligence report, criticized by many as overly broad, claiming to contain evidence of a Moscow-backed election interference campaign dubbed &#8220;Grizzly Steppe.&#8221; Soon after the initial Post story appeared, Burlington Electric came forward as the reportedly hacked organization. The municipally-owned utility clarified that had it had &#8220;detected the malware&#8221; on a single laptop, separate from its grid systems. In other words, the main premise of the Post story\u2014indeed, its headline\u2014turned out to be incorrect. The breach involved a solitary laptop and no penetration of the grid, the Post said in an editor&#8217;s note appended Saturday. Get Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter. A day later, Burlington Electric revealed more information about the incident, debunking suspicions. The code presumably associated with the Russian hacking operation turned out to be nothing more than a &#8220;specific type of Internet traffic&#8221; that had &#8220;been observed elsewhere in the country and is not unique to Burlington Electric,&#8221; the utility said in a second press release. The code in question was not a malicious software program, as some people suspected, but rather the appearance of a certain Internet connection. In a follow-up story published Monday evening, a different set of Post reporters\u2014citing more unnamed officials\u2014revealed that a security alert at Burlington Electric had tripped when an employee accessed a Yahoo yhoo email account. The alerts had been put in place after the Department of Homeland Security issued an industry-wide warning to the nation&#8217;s utilities, pointing to certain IP addresses contained in its &#8220;Grizzly Steppe&#8221; report, jointly produced with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The second Post story also reported that investigators later discovered malicious software on the Burlington Electric employee&#8217;s laptop. This was a common malware program called Neutrino that&#8217;s commonly deployed through online advertising networks, and likely unrelated to the Russian campaign &#8220;Grizzly Steppe.&#8221; For more on cybersecurity, watch: Before the investigators who were responding to Burlington Electric&#8217;s findings could suss out what really happened within the utility&#8217;s computer network, U.S. officials had apparently tipped the Post to an incomplete version of the news. It&#8217;s unclear whether the U.S. officials relayed inaccurate information, whether the reporters made false assumptions, or a combination. Then, the report spread like a computer worm. The dubious attribution to Russian hackers in the Burlington Electric incident\u2014specifically, to Russian hackers associated with U.S. election mischief\u2014arose because the utility had detected Internet connections that seemed to be linked to &#8220;Grizzly Steppe,&#8221; per the government&#8217;s report, despite the intelligence containing a range of IP addresses not exclusive to that hacking campaign. Indeed, a significant chunk of the IP addresses listed in the joint report mapped to ordinary proxy servers that privacy advocates, digital attackers, and others use to mask their tracks, as analyses of the set have showed. Cybersecurity experts who had pored over the White House-mandated &#8220;Grizzly Steppe&#8221; report, expecting to find revelations about the tactics of Russian election hackers, were disappointed to discover that the paper contained little actionable information. For security teams looking to find and block Russian malware, the data was &#8220;nearly useless,&#8221; as one expert, Robert Lee, founder of Dragos Security, put it in a widely read critique. Poor threat intelligence of this sort can be a costly distraction for resource-strapped security teams. The Washington Post Is Hiring Reporters, Bucking the Media Trend Burlington Electric, for its part, lamented the leaky lips of federal investigators when the organization was just trying to follow proper protocols in reporting the potential threat. &#8220;It\u2019s unfortunate that an official or officials improperly shared inaccurate information with one media outlet, leading to multiple inaccurate reports around the country,&#8221; said Mike Kanarick, communications director for the utility, in a statement. &#8220;Media reports stating that Burlington Electric was hacked or that the electric grid was breached are false,&#8221; he added. Quite a ruckus for a false alarm.","rendered":"\u003Cp\u003EA \u003Cem\u003EWashington Post\u003C\u002Fem\u003E report on Friday said that Russian hackers had \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.washingtonpost.com\u002Fworld\u002Fnational-security\u002Frussian-hackers-penetrated-us-electricity-grid-through-a-utility-in-vermont\u002F2016\u002F12\u002F30\u002F8fc90cc4-ceec-11e6-b8a2-8c2a61b0436f_story.html\"\u003Ebreached the nation&#8217;s power grid\u003C\u002Fa\u003E via a utility in Vermont, citing unnamed U.S. officials.

The new Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 mobile processor, shown off at the CES consumer electronics show in Las Vegas, will be the company&#8217;s high-end chip for smartphones, virtual-reality headsets, and mobile computers. It is smaller than Qualcomm&#8217;s previous chips, more power efficient, and provides faster Internet connectivity over mobile networks, according to the company. While Qualcomm QCOM didn&#8217;t say which high-end smartphones or tablets might support its new processor, the company did say it will be compatible with Google&#8217;s Android and Microsoft&#8217;s Windows operating systems. It also will be used in some upcoming smartglasses, which were previously announced by hardware maker Osterhout Design Group (ODG) and are targeted to consumers. Smartglasses are an emerging device category with companies like Microsoft and Google jumping into the fray.

ODG said in a statement accompanying the Snapdragon 835 announcement that the processor would help those smartglasses deliver better visuals and enhanced performance. Additionally, Qualcomm said that its processors and LTE modems would be embedded in some Volkswagen cars so they can connect to cellular networks. The first set of Volkswagen vehicles running its Snapdragon 820A processor will start hitting the road in 2019, and those using its other new chips, like the X12 and X5 LTE, will be available in 2018. For more about Qualcomm, watch: Also, Qualcomm said that it planned to offer high-speed, Gigabit LTE chips for connected cars so they can access the Internet. The LTE chip, which can reach speeds of 1 gigabit per second, or speeds that are dramatically faster than most home Internet connections, will be available to car manufacturers in the first half of 2017. Chipmakers like Qualcomm and Intel see big opportunities in the connected car market. An increasing number of cars use wireless connections to automatically provide performance information to their manufacturers to help with repairs and upgrades. Connections can also be used to get drivers and their passengers onto the Internet over wireless networks. Looking ahead, Internet connectivity could prove to be critical for self-driving cars, which must quickly see what other cars are doing and respond accordingly.","rendered":"\u003Cp\u003EQualcomm unveiled several new chips on Tuesday that are mostly focused on what it believes are fast-growth areas.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe new Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 mobile processor, shown off at the CES consumer electronics show in Las Vegas, will be the company&#8217;s high-end chip for smartphones, virtual-reality headsets, and mobile computers.

To be fair, while Trump tends to take credit for saving all these jobs\u2014he had threatened Ford with a 35% tariff on Mexican-built vehicles sold in the U.S.\u2014 Ford chief executive Mark Fields told CNN that the company &#8220;didn&#8217;t cut a deal with Trump. We did it for our business.&#8221; Whether you believe Ford&#8217;s move was due to Trump himself, or to a growing belief among voters that the country needs to maintain its own manufacturing capabilities, or that it just makes financial sense, as Fields argued, it is noteworthy. Last month, telecommunications company Sprint and satellite provider OneWeb announced plans to hire 5,000 U.S. workers. Although Trump claimed credit for those jobs, they were, in fact, part of a planned $50 billion U.S. investment by SoftBank Group founder Masayoshi Son before Trump&#8217;s election victory. SoftBank owns stakes in both Sprint and OneWeb. About 3,000 of those jobs would be at a new Florida factory where OneWeb says it will build low-cost satellites. It was unclear how many of the other jobs would be in manufacturing, but the fact that two tech companies committed so publicly to investing in American workers was noteworthy. And it was also great public relations since SoftBank also wants to revive a Sprint s merger with T-Mobile tmus that was proposed in 2014 but dropped in the face of U.S. regulatory resistance. SoftBank\u002FSprint might have better luck getting approval of the deal in a Trump administration. Apple, criticized by Trump in the past for its outsourced manufacturing, is a bellwether for tech stalwarts. Apple aapl has talked with Foxconn and Pegatron, two Asian contract manufacturers that build iPhones, to move some of their work stateside, according to unconfirmed reports. Furthermore, Apple CEO Tim Cook, along with his Microsoft and IBM counterparts Satya Nadella and Ginni Rometty respectively, attended Trump&#8217;s tech summit in New York last month. Creating U.S. jobs was one hot topic of the event. In an emailed statement, an Apple spokesman said the company: is responsible for creating more than two million jobs across the United States, from engineers, retail and call center employees to operations and delivery drivers. We work with over 8,000 suppliers from coast to coast and are investing heavily in American jobs and innovation. Get Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter. In a blog posted the day after the election, Microsoft president Brad Smith pointed out the need for more highly educated workers. He cited research showing that the U.S. economy added 35 million jobs over the last 25 years, but that the number of jobs held by those without a high school diploma fell 13% to 7.3 million while jobs for those with four-year degrees doubled. He stressed the need for private-public sector collaboration to boost jobs and innovation in the U.S. and elsewhere. But Smith made no mention of whether the company Microsoft would start making its Surface tablet devices in the U.S. or push its Asian manufacturing partners to open facilities here. For more on Ford&#8217;s factory move, watch: IBM&#8217;s Rometty, likewise, stated a need for companies to work with the U.S. government to improve the climate for job creation. In an open letter to Trump in November, she spoke about a need to train people for skilled jobs that don&#8217;t require two- or four-year college degrees. But again, there was little in the way of specifics and no mention of moving any services or manufacturing work to the U.S. from elsewhere. Fortune contacted Microsoft msft and IBM ibm for comment about their U.S. job plans and will update this article as needed. Toni Sacconaghi, senior research analyst with Bernstein Research said he hasn&#8217;t heard much from tech players about bringing jobs\u2014manufacturing or otherwise\u2014to the U.S. from abroad. And, Rometty&#8217;s plans, as spelled out in her letter, are &#8220;tough to interpret,&#8221; he said in an email. Thus far, SoftBank affiliates Sprint and OneWeb seem to be the only tech companies that have promised specific action on the domestic jobs front in the near term. The rest of the tech community has remained silent, at least publicly, about bringing manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. But then again, it&#8217;s early. One thing is certain, says Jeff Matthews, managing partner for RAM Partners, a Naples, Florida-based hedge fund, via email: &#8220;Every company I talk to is thinking about how to do more in America.

Kelly&#8217;s contract with Fox News isn&#8217;t officially up until July, but she began discussions in October with several broadcasters after a widely-reported tiff with then-presidential candidate Donald Trump boosted her public profile. It&#8217;s not clear what NBCUniversal will be paying her, but she was reportedly making $15 million a year at Fox. Despite her disagreement with Trump\u2014and a few tense exchanges with host Bill O&#8217;Reilly after she said she was sexually harassed by former Fox chairman Roger Ailes\u2014there&#8217;s no question that Kelly has been a key player at the conservative-leaning network. So does her hiring suggest that NBC is trying to move to the right in order to appeal to the kind of conservative audience that helped elect Trump? It&#8217;s hard not to see it in that light. (Fortune requested a comment from NBCUniversal on the implications of Kelly&#8217;s hire, and if one arrives, it will be added to this post). Make no mistake: despite everything, Megyn Kelly is an embodiment of Fox News and her move to NBC is a victory for its brand of journalism &mdash; Jack Mirkinson (@jackmirkinson) January 3, 2017 NBCUniversal News Group chairman Andrew Lack\u2014the architect of the Kelly hire, according to a report in the New York Times that broke the news of her departure\u2014said in a release that she is &#8220;an exceptional journalist.&#8221; A glowing profile in Vanity Fair last year described her as a &#8220;female role model who transcends politics.&#8221; Get Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter. All that said, however, Kelly also has a reputation for promoting right-wing views on a variety of topics, including race. For example, she talked about an alleged plan by President Obama to force white neighborhoods to diversify, and also repeatedly criticized the Black Lives Matter movement, casting doubt on whether police shootings had anything to do with race. Kelly has also made critical comments about gay and transgender issues on a number of occasions, according to the left-leaning media watchdog group Media Matters, and has repeatedly hosted anti-gay groups such as the Family Research Council, which believes that homosexuality is a sin and that gay men routinely recruit children to be homosexual. congrats to NBC on hiring on a woman who made a name for herself through blithe, insidious racism https:\u002F\u002Ft.co\u002F7FbJu0PD1S pic.twitter.com\u002F7UegCoLz7x &mdash; Ashley Feinberg (@ashleyfeinberg) January 3, 2017 The Fox anchor also spent a considerable amount of time on her show pushing the idea that the Obama administration was somehow involved in voter intimidation efforts in 2008 involving a group called the New Black Panther Party, despite a conspicuous lack of evidence to that effect. On a network like Fox News, Kelly might have appeared to be a moderate voice, especially after she stood up to Trump&#8217;s repeated public bullying. But she is clearly a leading voice for right-wing viewpoints, which is why Fox reportedly offered her $20 million a year to stay. These are all of Trump&#8217;s potential conflicts of interest: And Kelly isn&#8217;t the only conservative voice making the move from Fox fox to NBCUniversal cmcsa . Former host Greta Van Susteren, who left the network in September, will reportedly have a show on MSNBC soon, and former anchor Gretchen Carlson\u2014who triggered the departure of Ailes with her sexual harassment lawsuit\u2014recently guest-hosted the Today Show. For a network like NBC, embracing right-wing views by hiring and promoting hosts like Kelly may seem like a pragmatic move given what Trump&#8217;s election appears to say about the stance that many U.S. voters take on a number of issues.

But Arnold Schwarzenegger&#8217;s hosting debut wasn&#8217;t enough to give the network a ratings win for the show&#8217;s premiere. The latest iteration of Comcast-owned NBC&#8217;s Apprentice reality TV franchise\u2014which featured now president-elect Donald Trump as host for more than a decade\u2014lost the ratings battle with rival networks ABC and CBS cbs during the 8 p.m. ET primetime slot on Monday night. With Schwarzenegger now in the hosting chair, The New Celebrity Apprentice averaged roughly 4.9 million total viewers across its two-hour premiere, according to Nielsen&#8217;s tracking numbers. ABC&#8217;s two-hour The Bachelor premiere pulled in nearly 6.6 million viewers by comparison, while CBS averaged more than 6 million viewers between four half-hour sitcoms that aired between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. While NBC heavily promoted Schwarzenegger&#8217;s Apprentice takeover ahead of the show&#8217;s January debut, the movie star and former California governor&#8217;s reality TV turn got off to a mediocre start, especially when compared with the ratings of his predecessor. The ratings for last night&#8217;s Celebrity Apprentice premiere were down more than 22% from the debut episode of Trump&#8217;s most recent season hosting (2014-2015). The show averaged 7.6 million nightly viewers in that season, and the ratings for the key demographic (viewers aged 18 to 49) across that season was roughly 46% higher than what Schwarzenegger&#8217;s debut scored on Monday. The network has been pushing the show&#8217;s new host and new season for months, including weathering last month&#8217;s controversy over the fact that president-elect Trump will continue receiving an executive producer credit on the show going forward. (As Fortune reported at the time, Trump has a large stake in the show that he co-created with fellow producer Mark Burnett, but will reportedly be compensated by MGM, which owns the majority stake in the production company that owns the rights to the Apprentice franchise.)

The London-based company unveiled the product \u2014 which is part of the ever-growing Internet of Things (making everyday objects smart and connected) \u2014 at CES 2017, the big tech trade show in Las Vegas this week. Smarter\u2019s FridgeCam is a wireless camera with an app that allows users to see the contents of their fridge from anywhere, receive reminders about expiration dates, and pick up groceries that are running low. Scheduled for release in the first quarter of 2017, the Smarter FridgeCam was designed to help address the global food waste crisis by notifying consumers of approaching expiration dates and suggesting ways to use foods before they go bad. Related: Tim Ferriss\u2019 Secret to Achieving a Breakthrough? Ask Absurd Questions. Additional features include alerts when the refrigerator temperature ventures outside the ideal range, notifications when food items are removed from the fridge, and auto-replenish ordering via the user\u2019s preferred online grocer. Geo-location reminders will alert the user when a grocery store is nearby, so milk, eggs, or other essentials can be purchased. The Smarter FridgeCam will sell for $150. Christian Lane, creator of Smarter, launched his first company at 19 with the backing of investors from Dragon\u2019s Den, the U.K. version of Shark Tank. Christian launched Smarter in 2013, with the goal of making people\u2019s lives easier through connected technology. He is the recipient of 2015 Great Britain Young Entrepreneur of the Year, London Design Awards, and other accolades for his IoT contributions. \u201cWe are very excited to showcase our FridgeCam with its full range of functions for the first time anywhere in the world,\u201d Lane said in a statement. \u201cWe created the FridgeCam to not only save people money, time, and energy, but also tackle food waste head-on in the process. In the U.S., average households can waste anywhere between $1,365 to $2,275 of food every year.\u201d Smarter\u2019s other products, the iKettle and Smarter Coffee Maker, are sold in more than 1,000 stores in the U.K. and Europe. By the end of 2017, Smarter expects to become a global connected platform that connects consumers to their kitchens, making grocery shopping and food waste a thing of the past. Smarter is self-funded and it has 20 employees. This article originally appeared on VentureBeat.

Tech Titans, Pressured By Trump, Create More U.S. Factory Jobs?"},"content":{"plain":"A surprise move by Ford on Tuesday to kill a planned $1.6 billion auto plant in Mexico and move that work instead to Michigan may be a sign that business leaders have listened to President-elect Donald Trump, who has blasted U.S. companies for shipping jobs overseas. A big question is whether tech giants like Apple, IBM and Microsoft, all of whom rely heavily on foreign manufacturers, will follow Ford&#8217;s f lead. To be fair, while Trump tends to take credit for saving all these jobs\u2014he had threatened Ford with a 35% tariff on Mexican-built vehicles sold in the U.S.\u2014 Ford chief executive Mark Fields told CNN that the company &#8220;didn&#8217;t cut a deal with Trump. We did it for our business.&#8221; Whether you believe Ford&#8217;s move was due to Trump himself, or to a growing belief among voters that the country needs to maintain its own manufacturing capabilities, or that it just makes financial sense, as Fields argued, it is noteworthy. Last month, telecommunications company Sprint and satellite provider OneWeb announced plans to hire 5,000 U.S. workers. Although Trump claimed credit for those jobs, they were, in fact, part of a planned $50 billion U.S. investment by SoftBank Group founder Masayoshi Son before Trump&#8217;s election victory. SoftBank owns stakes in both Sprint and OneWeb. About 3,000 of those jobs would be at a new Florida factory where OneWeb says it will build low-cost satellites. It was unclear how many of the other jobs would be in manufacturing, but the fact that two tech companies committed so publicly to investing in American workers was noteworthy. And it was also great public relations since SoftBank also wants to revive a Sprint s merger with T-Mobile tmus that was proposed in 2014 but dropped in the face of U.S. regulatory resistance. SoftBank\u002FSprint might have better luck getting approval of the deal in a Trump administration. Apple, criticized by Trump in the past for its outsourced manufacturing, is a bellwether for tech stalwarts. Apple aapl has talked with Foxconn and Pegatron, two Asian contract manufacturers that build iPhones, to move some of their work stateside, according to unconfirmed reports. Furthermore, Apple CEO Tim Cook, along with his Microsoft and IBM counterparts Satya Nadella and Ginni Rometty respectively, attended Trump&#8217;s tech summit in New York last month. Creating U.S. jobs was one hot topic of the event. In an emailed statement, an Apple spokesman said the company: is responsible for creating more than two million jobs across the United States, from engineers, retail and call center employees to operations and delivery drivers. We work with over 8,000 suppliers from coast to coast and are investing heavily in American jobs and innovation. Get Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter. In a blog posted the day after the election, Microsoft president Brad Smith pointed out the need for more highly educated workers. He cited research showing that the U.S. economy added 35 million jobs over the last 25 years, but that the number of jobs held by those without a high school diploma fell 13% to 7.3 million while jobs for those with four-year degrees doubled. He stressed the need for private-public sector collaboration to boost jobs and innovation in the U.S. and elsewhere. But Smith made no mention of whether the company Microsoft would start making its Surface tablet devices in the U.S. or push its Asian manufacturing partners to open facilities here. For more on Ford&#8217;s factory move, watch: IBM&#8217;s Rometty, likewise, stated a need for companies to work with the U.S. government to improve the climate for job creation. In an open letter to Trump in November, she spoke about a need to train people for skilled jobs that don&#8217;t require two- or four-year college degrees. But again, there was little in the way of specifics and no mention of moving any services or manufacturing work to the U.S. from elsewhere. Fortune contacted Microsoft msft and IBM ibm for comment about their U.S. job plans and will update this article as needed. Toni Sacconaghi, senior research analyst with Bernstein Research said he hasn&#8217;t heard much from tech players about bringing jobs\u2014manufacturing or otherwise\u2014to the U.S. from abroad. And, Rometty&#8217;s plans, as spelled out in her letter, are &#8220;tough to interpret,&#8221; he said in an email. Thus far, SoftBank affiliates Sprint and OneWeb seem to be the only tech companies that have promised specific action on the domestic jobs front in the near term. The rest of the tech community has remained silent, at least publicly, about bringing manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. But then again, it&#8217;s early. One thing is certain, says Jeff Matthews, managing partner for RAM Partners, a Naples, Florida-based hedge fund, via email: &#8220;Every company I talk to is thinking about how to do more in America. I&#8217;m not sure that they will, but it is now something that&#8217;s on everybody&#8217;s radar, which can&#8217;t hurt.&#8221;","rendered":"\u003Cp\u003EA surprise move by Ford on Tuesday \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ffortune.com\u002F2017\u002F01\u002F03\u002Fford-cancels-mexico-plant-trump\u002F\"\u003Eto kill a planned $1.6 billion auto plant\u003C\u002Fa\u003E in Mexico and move that work instead to Michigan may be a sign that business leaders have listened to President-elect Donald Trump, who has blasted U.S. companies for shipping jobs overseas.

Intel joins HERE&#8217;s current owners\u2014carmakers Audi, BMW, and Daimler\u2014in their efforts to build a vast global map and location database that doesn&#8217;t rely on information from Apple aapl or Google. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich has targeted making chips and sensors for self-driving cars, automated robots, and AI-enhanced drones as one of the company&#8217;s new growth market. The carmakers bought HERE from Nokia in 2015 for $3 billion. Intel intc declined to disclose how much it paid for its 15% stake. Get Data Sheet, Fortune&#8217;s technology newsletter. &#8220;Cars are rapidly becoming some of the world\u2019s most intelligent, connected devices,&#8221; Krzanich said in a statement. &#8220;We look forward to working with HERE and its automotive partners to deliver an important technology foundation for smart and connected cars of the future.&#8221; Intel&#8217;s aim is to help the car makers create much more robust and detailed mapping hardware and software that will be needed for truly autonomous vehicles. HERE&#8217;s next generation mapping applications will be able to pinpoint a car&#8217;s location within centimeters, down from exactness in meters today, the company says. HERE&#8217;s current product offerings run the gamut from a consumer-oriented smartphone app called HERE WeGo to live traffic data that can be licensed and fed into car navigation systems, all built on top of its ecosystem of mapping data and related software tools. The head of Intel&#8217;s automated driving group, Doug Davis, will join HERE&#8217;s supervisory board after the transaction is completed. The deal is expected to close before the end of the first quarter. Google googl has long dominated the market for digitally usable map and location data for portable devices, after it spent billions building its data sets. Apple had to play catch up after it created its own smartphone map app in 2012, relying on licensing data from Dutch provider TomTom.

We\u2019ve compiled some of our favorite pieces of career advice published in 2016: Sarah Kauss, founder and CEO of S\u2019well: Delegation can sometimes come off as negative\u2014like you\u2019re just pushing off work on someone else\u2014but it doesn\u2019t have to be perceived that way. Don\u2019t just say \u201cno\u201d to a request. You should, in fact, pass it along when you\u2019re too busy. And that\u2019s not a bad thing. Think of the opportunity you are giving others. A conference organizer may not always want your senior vice president when the founder or CEO can\u2019t make the event. But if you show that you trust someone else with an opportunity\u200a\u2014\u200asuch as establishing your company\u2019s brand reputation\u200a\u2014\u200ayou may be surprised by the positive reactions you\u2019ll receive. Dennis Yang, CEO of Udemy: Hiring begins with the job description itself, which needs to reflect the position\u2019s real requirements and responsibilities. Too many companies go forth in search of a left-handed, purple unicorn: that elusive individual who possesses mastery in a broad range of skills and can single-handedly do the job of many people. Unfortunately, unicorns don\u2019t exist. Companies that think they\u2019ve hired one stand to be disappointed, and candidates who represent themselves as such are either on the fast track to burnout or are overselling themselves. Your job listings need to be realistic in order to attract real candidates and give your interviewers tangible evaluation criteria. Amber Theorharis, host for the NFL Network: When [a] job opens, take it\u2014even if the salary is low. Success doesn\u2019t happen overnight, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with starting at the bottom. That\u2019s where you make mistakes that will be the least devastating to your professional reputation\u2014and you can still learn from them. The money and the position will come later, but you have to get in the game. Take a side job to pay the bills if your career can\u2019t. I waited tables after work and on weekends for almost two years while working on-air at a small TV station in Salisbury, Md. My dream was bigger than my pride. &nbsp; Jeremy Roche, president and CEO of FinancialForce: I can\u2019t express enough how important it is to throw your ego out the door. When you jump into a new career or position, there is a 100% chance you will make mistakes. No matter how much experience you have and how high up the ranks you were, when you start a new job, you will have to prove yourself all over again. And while that might sound daunting, you have to stay positive. Embrace the unknown and be willing to go back to the basics of learning new skills. This experience can build empathy, truly enhancing your leadership skills in the long run. Kim Metcalf-Kupres, vice president and chief marketing officer of Johnson Controls: Fight for change when it matters and learn to let lesser issues roll off. While gender parity continues to improve in traditionally male-dominated fields, the reality is that we all have preconceived perceptions of how things should be, and culture change does not happen overnight. In these moments, especially if they involve unconscious bias, it is essential to educate others and provide your perspective in a kind and respectful manner. Don\u2019t sweat the small stuff.","rendered":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EEvery day at Fortune, influential leaders, entrepreneurs, and Fortune 500 executives offer valuable insight from their experiences navigating the business world.

Fortune 500\u2019s 7 Best-Performing Stocks of 2016"},"content":{"plain":"For 2016\u2019s best-performing Fortune 500 stocks, you can definitely call it a comeback. In a year when the S&amp;P 500 has gained a solid 10%, these Fortune 500 companies ran circles around that return: All of the stocks on this list at least doubled their share prices in 2016, and the top two winners each more than quadrupled. Still, you won\u2019t find any high-growth tech companies on this list. Most of this year&#8217;s big winners come from unsexy industries beset by struggles from which these firms are just starting to emerge. Three are steel companies whose stocks took off after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election, prompting hopes of a wave of new spending on infrastructure. Also, although Fortune 500 members are, by definition, the largest companies in the U.S. by revenue, none of this year&#8217;s top gainers was among the very biggest of the big. Indeed, six of the top 10 performers come from the bottom half of the 500 list. Even though they may no longer be underdogs, the stocks of many of 2016\u2019s best performers remain well below their all-time highs, and several still look cheap. So even if you missed out on a four-bagger return this year, there may be more rallies to come for some of these stocks in 2017. Here&#8217;s the full list of 2016\u2019s biggest Fortune 500 stock winners. 1. AK Steel Holding Fortune 500 rank: No. 383 2016 return: 359% Courtesy of AK Steel Holding Iron ore and steel prices fell precipitously in 2015 on slowing demand for construction material in China. But they bounced back forcefully after hitting bottom in early 2016, as steel producers cut production dramatically. After several years of losses, AK Steel aks is expected to turn a profit in 2016, as the company continued to cut costs while also benefiting from higher prices. Still, the steepest jump in AK Steel\u2019s stock price came after Trump won the election: AK\u2019s shares are up more than 74% since Nov. 8. Not only is the Trump administration likely to green-light more infrastructure projects that will rely on heavy materials such as steel, the President-elect has signaled that he will enact trade policies that make imported steel less attractive while tipping the scales toward U.S. producers. Oh, and it doesn\u2019t hurt that Trump\u2019s nominee for secretary of commerce is Wilbur Ross, the founder and former CEO of a major steel company. \u201cTrump\u2019s impact on trade and therefore domestic steel supply and prices could be much quicker and more meaningful than Trump\u2019s infrastructure plans,\u201d write J.P. Morgan analysts, who rate AK Steel &#8220;overweight&#8221; (that is, a buy). 2.United States Steel Fortune 500 rank: No. 244 2016 return: 332% Courtesy of United States Steel Like AK Steel&#8217;s shares, United States Steel x stock surged this year as steel prices rose, then accelerated further after Trump\u2019s victory (gaining more than 70% since the election). U.S. Steel doesn\u2019t have quite as much leeway to cut costs as smaller peers like AK. That makes it extremely sensitive to steel prices\u2014and also makes it the American steel stock that could benefit the most from a recovery in that market, according to J.P. Morgan. As the amount of steel imported from China continues to decline and domestic production stays in check, the price of the metal will likely keep going up\u2014sending U.S. Steel even higher. 3. Navistar International Fortune 500 rank: No. 281 2016 return: 236% Mahindra Navistar trucks at a factory in Maharashtra, India.(Kuni Takahashi\u002FBloomberg) This year\u2019s rally in Navistar\u2019s stock\u2014which more than tripled in 2016\u2014has almost (but not quite) made up for its terrible 2015, when the shares fell 74%. Navistar nav , which makes diesel engines and trucks, took a costly wrong turn a few years ago when it tried and failed to develop its own emissions-reducing system to meet new Environmental Protection Agency standards. In March, it had to pay $7.5 million to settle Securities and Exchange Commission charges that it misled shareholders about its technology\u2019s capability to cut emissions. While the end of that investigation popped the lid off Navistar\u2019s stock price, the tipping point came just after Labor Day, when Volkswagen\u2014a company that faced its own (much larger) emissions scandal\u2014announced it was taking a nearly 17% stake in the company. Navistar\u2019s shares surged 41% in a single day on the news. Other investors in the company include high-profile activist Carl Icahn. 4. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Fortune 500 rank: No. 16 (Fannie Mae) and No. 43 (Freddie Mac) 2016 return: 140% (Fannie Mae) and 136% (Freddie Mac) Fannie Mae headquarters in Washington, D.C.Photograph by Kevin Lamarque \u2014 Reuters We&#8217;ve lumped these two stocks together here because their businesses, their recent stock performance and their near-term outlooks are close to identical. Prior to the presidential election, Fannie&#8217;s and Freddie\u2019s share prices were pretty much flat for 2016. But that all changed when Trump won the White House: Both Fannie Mae fnma and Freddie Mac fmcc stock have more than doubled since the Nov. 8 vote. The reason is fairly straightforward: Trump\u2019s treasury secretary pick, former Goldman Sachs banker Steven Mnuchin, suggested privatizing Fannie and Freddie, which have been under government control since the mortgage lenders received a giant bailout during the financial crisis. That outcome would be a far cry from what was expected just a few years ago, when Fannie and Freddie\u2019s shares were worth just pennies as the government indicated that it would eventually phase them out entirely. Privatizing the quasi-governmental companies would also a huge boon to a growing contingent of hedge fund speculators, who have invested in the pair and advocated that the government allow the companies to keep more of their own profits. One indication of Fannie and Freddie\u2019s wild ride since the Great Recession? They were the top two best-performing Fortune 500 stocks in 2013, returning more than 1000% each, only to land on the list of worst performers the following year. 5.Oneok Fortune 500 rank: No. 348 2016 return: 135.6% Courtesy of Oneok An Oklahoma-based natural gas production and pipeline company, Oneok oke struggled when that commodity\u2019s price fell along with oil prices starting a couple of years ago: Oneok stock was down 46% in 2015. But as natural gas prices surged this year, Oneok\u2019s shares more than doubled. Still, they have yet to recover to where they were trading at their peak in the summer of 2014. 6. Freeport-McMoRan Fortune 500 rank: No. 175 2016 return: 106% Copper-gold concentrate from Freeport McMoRan Inc.&#8217;s Grasberg copper and gold mine is loaded onto a ship in Amamapare, Papua province, Indonesia.Dadang Tri\u2014Bloomberg After a five-year bear market in precious metals including gold, silver and copper\u2014all of which Freeport-McMoRan fcx produces at its mines\u2014the prices of those commodities rallied in 2016 as supply came down closer in line with demand. Trump\u2019s election win gave copper an additional kick, with investors believing that his administration\u2019s expected infrastructure projects will need to rely on that building material. Freeport had suffered particularly in recent years from its decision to diversify into the oil business\u2014at what turned out to be exactly the wrong time, as prices plummeted. It sold off some of its energy business this year, relieving it of some of the debt it had taken on in the process. Still, Freeport maintains substantial operations in that area that will benefit if oil prices continue to rise. 7.Steel Dynamics Fortune 500 rank: No. 356 2016 return: 100% Courtesy of Steel Dynamics Unlike its fellow steelmakers on this list\u2014AK Steel and United States Steel\u2014Steel Dynamics stld managed to ride out steel&#8217;s 2015 price downturn relatively unscathed: Its stock price only shed about 7% last year. The company also stayed profitable, generating hefty free cash flow. Still, Steel Dynamics still got a major boost from rising prices this year. And it&#8217;s particularly well positioned to profit from increasing demand for steel, as the company has greatly expanded the amount it can produce since the 2008 financial crisis.","rendered":"\u003Cp\u003EFor 2016\u2019s best-performing \u003Cem\u003EFortune\u003C\u002Fem\u003E 500 stocks, you can definitely call it a comeback.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn a year when the S&amp;P 500 has gained a solid 10%, these \u003Cem\u003EFortune\u003C\u002Fem\u003E 500 companies ran circles around that return: All of the stocks on this list at least doubled their share prices in 2016, and the top two winners each more than quadrupled.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EStill, you won\u2019t find any high-growth tech companies on this list.

And unlike past picks, this one has no record of criticizing net neutrality, the 2015 rules that prevent Internet service providers from slowing or blocking online content and services. David Morken, co-founder of Republic Wireless and an entrepreneur from Raleigh, N.C., will join three prior Trump FCC transition team members in helping set policies at the agency that regulates telecommunications, cable TV, and the Internet, Politico reported on Thursday. But unlike previous Trump FCC transition picks, Morken has no obvious and widespread record of speaking out against the agency&#8217;s moves in 2015 to protect competition on the Internet through net neutrality rules. Companies like AT&amp;T t and Verizon have complained that the rules over-regulate the industry and deter investment in networks. Rather, Morken was quoted in the Wall Street Journal on Dec. 9 expressing concern about the tilt of some of the earlier picks. Get Data Sheet, Fortune&#8217;s technology newsletter. &#8220;Traditional Republican telecom policy has favored incumbents who are heavily engaged in regulatory capture over innovators like us,&#8221; Morken was quoted saying in article about Trump&#8217;s expected FCC policies to demolish regulations that protect smaller players. Morken told the paper he was a lifelong Republican, but in &#8220;every election I have to choose between voting personal conviction or business interests.&#8221; Fortune contacted Morken for comment and will update this story if we receive a response. Trump&#8217;s first three picks had ties to the largest companies in the telecom sector and had written publicly against the FCC&#8217;s rules on net neutrality. For more on the net neutrality battle, watch: Jeff Eisenach, an economist who has been on Verizon\u2019s vz payroll, and Mark Jamison, who formerly worked on Sprint\u2019s s lobbying team and now heads the University of Florida\u2019s Public Utility Research Center, opposed the net neutrality rules and other policies of the FCC under Obama appointee Tom Wheeler. A third appointee, Roslyn Layton is a telecom industry consultant and visiting fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who has opposed both net neutrality and Internet privacy rules. The two current Republican members of the FCC, Ajit Pai and Michael O&#8217;Rielly, have said rolling back the net neutrality rules will be a top priority next year.

Perhaps more importantly for those who insisted that AWS was a loss-leader for its parent company, the cloud unit reported profit of $1.02 billion for that period, at least if employee stock compensation is excluded. With that compensation factored in, profit was a still-healthy $821 million, up from $428 million from the year before. But 2017 will not be a walk in the park for Amazon amzn largely because at least some of those tech rivals mentioned above have gotten their acts together, building data centers worldwide, and investing heavily in their public cloud services. Microsoft msft , in particular, has been making progress, says Dave Bartoletti, principal analyst for Forrester Research forr . Microsoft Azure is now a strong number two in public cloud while Google goog , IBM ibm , and others battle it out for the number three slot, in his view. Get Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter. In the face of that heightened competition, Amazon must continue to appeal to its core base of developers at small companies, who started flocking to its services ten years ago, using credit cards to rent servers and storage, typically circumventing IT control. And it must now also woo those same IT people, as it seeks more big corporate business. That&#8217;s a fine line. In fact, it&#8217;s almost schizophrenic. Every year at the annual AWS Re:Invent conference, one day is dedicated to products geared for IT professionals who typically work to provision servers and storage, and maintain databases. Another day is all about cutting-edge and the latest trending tech, like tools for the Internet of things. Amazon has been very strategic\u2014and ambitious\u2014with new products for that IT demographic. Two of the hardest-to-dislodge technologies in big companies are Oracle databases and VMware virtualization software. It is very difficult to move customers off these deeply entrenched products, no matter how much the companies might like to do so. &#8220;Every year one goal for most companies is to reduce spending on Oracle and VMware, and every year IT comes back and say &#8216;we didn\u2019t do it.&#8217; That&#8217;s because to reduce spending on Oracle and VMware requires risk and money,&#8221; Bartoletti says. For the past few years, AWS has targeted Oracle with such products as a MySQL database clone and a database migration tool to automate the tricky process of moving on-premises Oracle (or Microsoft) databases to AWS. This year, it announced its own managed version of PostgreSQL. PostgreSQL, is seen as a more enterprise-ready, open-source database than MySQL, which Oracle owns. For more on AWS, watch And for all those petabytes of corporate data accumulating in company data centers over the decades? This year, AWS came out with an actual truck, dubbed Snowmobile, which it says can securely ship up to 100 petabytes of data from corporate server rooms to an AWS facility in one fell swoop. It seems like brute force\u2014and it is\u2014but face it, using even a high-speed network connection moving that amount of data would take forever. Amazon says Snowmobile will enable companies to move an exabyte (or 1,000 petabytes) of data to Amazon in six months or so. That same data transfer would take 20 years over a fast, 10Gbps dedicated connection, the company said. On the VMware vmw side, AWS and VMware are working together on VMware Cloud on AWS, due out in mid-2017. In theory, it will let VMware customers run their existing VMware operations directly on AWS servers. This was pitched as a win for joint customers and both AWS and VMware. But most cloud watchers suspect that many of those VMware users will end up moving their VMware workloads to AWS and then, over time, off of VMware altogether. Time will tell. But for those who think AWS has already won the public cloud wars, remember, it&#8217;s hard to maintain technology dominance over many generations. And also remember, that big Fortune 500 companies have barely put their toes in the water yet. Most estimates hold that 5% or 6% of big company workloads are in the public cloud at this point. That&#8217;s the tippy-top of an enormous ice berg. That leaves the other cloud providers\u2014at least those with big checkbooks\u2014with room to maneuver.","rendered":"\u003Cp\u003EOver the last decade, \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ffortune.com\u002Ffortune500\u002Famazoncom-18\u002F\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EAmazon\u003C\u002Fa\u003E Web Services has become the focal point of every tech company, most of which are now fighting to build their own public clouds.

Heavy Combat Between Cable and Wireless in 2017"},"content":{"plain":"For over a decade, AT&amp;T has been ramping up its television programming offerings. Last year&#8217;s $49 billion acquisition of satellite TV provider DirecTV, combined with the company&#8217;s U-verse cable offering, gave AT&amp;T the largest pay TV subscriber base in the industry \u2014though growing that audience much bigger has proven challenging. But in 2017, big cable is poised to strike back. Comcast and Charter Communications, the two largest cable TV companies, are promising to get into the mobile phone business, and things could interesting in a hurry. The cable companies say they will pitch a bundled service that includes TV, Internet, and mobile features. Bundling\u2014at the right price\u2014can lower the risk of customers defecting to one of the growing number of Internet-based video services. And instead of spending billions on airwave licenses, the cable companies have cut a deal with Verizon to lease wireless data and calling capacity. Get Data Sheet, Fortune&#8217;s technology newsletter. Starting in mid-2017, Comcast is planning to offer &#8220;an attractively-priced multi-product bundle&#8221; CEO Brian Roberts told analysts in October. Charter CEO Tom Rutledge seemed to be speaking from the same cue cards when he told analysts last month his company will be &#8220;offering an attractively priced product bundle&#8221; with an eye towards reducing customer churn. The economic key to the cable wireless services, however, will be the companies&#8217; vast networks of wifi routers deployed across their service territories. Using Verizon&#8217;s wireless capacity could get expensive, but piggybacking mobile customers on wifi signals is virtually cost-free. A few tiny carriers have sprung up trying to use such a hybrid approach to reduce costs, but Comcast cmcsa and Charter chtr will be operating on a vastly greater scale. Comcast, for its part, says it has 15 million hotspots deployed. The question remains just how many cable customers want to handcuff their wireless service to their broadband and television provider. Cable companies have long suffered from poor customer satisfaction ratings and convincing subscribers to sign up for a new hybrid form of mobile service could be difficult. For more on Comcast&#8217;s wireless plans, watch: In the past, the benefits of bundling haven&#8217;t been all that attractive, Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research says. &#8220;It\u2019s never really seemed to capture customers\u2019 attention, in part because it means two of your biggest monthly bills get combined and there\u2019s little benefit beyond maybe a $5 discount or something,&#8221; Dawson says. In theory, new, strong competition for AT&amp;T, Verizon vz , Sprint s , and T-Mobile tmus should bring down prices and improve features for consumers. But the cable companies may be more interested in preserving their existing businesses than in disrupting wireless, Dawson adds. &#8220;We\u2019ll see to what extent this is really about saving consumers money or providing other really meaningful benefits versus simple bundling,&#8221; he says. Previous cable efforts to get into wireless didn&#8217;t get very far. Comcast and other cable companies were early backers of upstart wireless firm Clearwire but dumped an agreement to resell service back in 2011 after almost no customers signed up. Clearwire ended up being acquired by Sprint shortly thereafter. Even before that, cable companies spent billions buying airwave rights in 2006 but most never offered any service and Verizon bought the licenses in 2011. Part of that deal included the leasing rights that Comcast and Charter will use next year when they enter the market. Even if they don&#8217;t win many customers, the cable incursion could wound the wireless industry in one important way, however. This year, the four big telecom carriers were among the best performing stocks in the market, led by Sprint&#8217;s 144% gain, as of December 29. T-Mobile was up 49%, AT&amp;T t rose 24% and Verizon added 16%. But just as the perception of cord cutting hurt some media stocks this summer out of proportion to its actual impact on financial results, the much hyped entry of cable into wireless could spook telecom investors. &#8220;We don\u2019t expect cable to have any significant impact on the wireless market until around 2020,&#8221; industry analyst Craig Moffett at MoffettNathanson Research wrote recently. &#8220;When they do enter the wireless space, however, it won\u2019t be good news for the incumbents.&#8221; How Taylor Swift Could Help AT&amp;T Win Over Cord Cutters Meanwhile, AT&amp;T is getting even more into TV and could dent the cable industry&#8217;s revenue with its new Internet-based video service called DirecTV Now. Offering more than 100 cable channels at a starting price of $35, the service is being pitched to the 20 million or so households that don&#8217;t currently pay for TV, so-called cord cutters and cord nevers. But it&#8217;s pretty easy to see how the low price could also prove alluring to regular cable customers tired of paying an average of over $100 per month for TV service. Still, cable has a solid strategy to fight back, according to analyst Moffett. Cable companies are the leading provider of broadband Internet service, which customers will still need, even after they decide to drop cable TV service for DirecTV Now or other, similar services. And by manipulative pricing of different bundles, cable companies have &#8220;a very powerful pricing counter-balance,&#8221; Moffett says. So expect a lot more headlines about cable versus wireless competition next year. But the actual impact on consumers&#8217; pocketbooks may be harder to discern.","rendered":"\u003Cp\u003EFor over a decade, \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ffortune.com\u002Ffortune500\u002Fatt-10\u002F\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EAT&amp;T\u003C\u002Fa\u003E has been ramping up its television programming offerings.

Now operating as part of the company Access in Alphabet&#8217;s &#8220;other bets&#8221; division, the fiber service has recently seen its CEO depart without being replaced, halted expansion in new cities, and laid off almost 10% of its staff. On Thursday, that convergence of factors prompted speculation by the tech news web site The Information that Google is likely getting ready to dispose of the service, which was a pioneer in bringing gigabit Internet download speeds to consumers.

A few months prior, the service had announced it was revamping its business model to use more wireless technology as it paused all planned expansions into brand new cities. Google is hardly the first company to run into cost issues while trying to provide consumer Internet and cable TV service, even before the era of high-speed fiber optic connections.

But famed short sellers at Citron Research say Nvidia&#8217;s stock is poised to fall about 20% after its big rally. Citron, which generally picks stocks its thinks will decline in value, says there are half a dozen problems ahead for Nvidia, mainly related to top competitors Intel and Advanced Micro Devices. While Nvidia has been touting its progress in cracking new markets like computer chips tuned for artificial intelligence, most of its success in 2016 came from gains in its traditional PC and gaming graphics chips, the firm said in a report on Wednesday. That could leave it more vulnerable to traditional competition than many investors expect, the firm wrote. Nvidia shares fell 5% in mid-day trading on Wednesday after the report was released. Get Data Sheet, Fortune&#8217;s technology newsletter. Citron, run by Andrew Left, is among the most prominent short sellers, or investors who bet stocks will decline in value. Last year, Left called Valeant Pharmaceuticals vrx as overvalued\u2014dubbing it the &#8220;pharmaceutical Enron&#8221;\u2014before its stock crashed. Nvidia&#8217;s 2016 stock rise came as its revenue and profit have skyrocketed. Last quarter, revenue rose 54% from the same period a year earlier to a record $2 billion while net income increased 120% to $542 million. But Citron said not much of the gain was from new markets, but rather from seizing larger market share in the gaming market from AMD. Such gains can&#8217;t continue at the same pace in the future, limiting potential growth. Nvidia nvda has also targeted selling more chips for large data center servers, but massive competition is coming in 2017 from new high performance chips from Intel intc and AMD amd , Citron noted. And some of the largest data center owners, like Google googl , are shifting to their own custom chips. Apple aapl could possibly do the same for graphics chips it buys from Nvidia, Citron said, though recent Mac models use AMD chips. For more on Intel&#8217;s plans, watch: Another problem could hit Nvidia&#8217;s profit margin as it competes more directly with Intel. Nvidia doesn&#8217;t own chip fabricating factories, as Intel does, and instead relies on outsourcing to manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing tsmc . That gives Intel greater pricing flexibility, which could put pressure on Nvidia, Citron wrote. Intel could reduce the price of its chips by 37% and still have an 80% margin. Also, a deal to license intellectual property to Intel is coming to end, which will cut off a highly lucrative royalty stream, Citron says. As fans of Amazon amzn and Netflix nflx found out in 2016, one year&#8217;s top performing stock is rarely a great bet for the subsequent year. For investors who made a killing in Nvidia this year, it may be wise to move on.","rendered":"\u003Cp\u003EShares of chipmaker Nvidia have gained 237% this year, making the company one of the best performing stocks of 2016.

But the company still has a lot riding on executing well next year. First and foremost, Microsoft, under Satya Nadella\u2014who stepped in as chief executive, replacing Ballmer about three years ago\u2014must prove it can do big acquisitions well. Microsoft&#8217;s record there is checkered following misfires with Nokia and aQuantive\u2014both purchases resulting in huge write-offs. That means all eyes will be on how the software giant does with its just completed $26 billion purchase of LinkedIn. There&#8217;s no shortage of opinions about where LinkedIn is weak. With a clunky interface, it incessantly nudges users to share information and interact with people they may or may not want to engage. Does anyone actually appreciate reminders to send holiday greetings to long-forgotten associates? But LinkedIn has strengths as well\u2014chief among them the sheer amount of information it holds. That&#8217;s a big data treasure trove Microsoft msft hopes to parlay to boost the prospects of its business-focused customer relationship management software (CRM), used by sales people to enter and track sales leads. LinkedIn, despite the interface and spammy tendencies, has data on some 467 million users worldwide. Microsoft hopes to parlay that data to grow its own business software portfolio. If you&#8217;re a sales person using Microsoft Dynamics CRM for sales management, it would be useful to automatically search for people with certain titles at top companies and automatically import them into your prospect list. That is why CRM leader Salesforce.com crm also wanted to acquire LinkedIn\u2014only to be outbid. Benioff, founder and chief executive of Salesforce.com even dusted off the &#8220;M&#8221; word in referring to Microsoft&#8217;s &#8220;monopolistic&#8221; tendencies. Most hadn&#8217;t thought of Microsoft in those terms since the early part of the century, when it was deemed a monopoly by a federal court judge, only to have that ruling over turned on a technicality. Since then, the advent of a resurging Apple aapl , along with Google googl , Amazon amzn Web Services (AWS), and Salesforce itself ended any illusion of Microsoft as overly huge and powerful. Benioff blasted the proposed Microsoft deal as anti-competitive, charging that Microsoft could keep software rivals from using that LinkedIn data. The purchase nonetheless passed muster with regulatory agencies although European regulators mandated that Microsoft must give outside social networks the same access to the Microsoft Graph and Microsoft Office plug-ins and programming interfaces that LinkedIn gets. Microsoft will need to add value to LinkedIn in part by improving the aforementioned interface\u2014which it has said is in the works\u2014but also monetize that LinkedIn data without alienating users with more spam. For more on Microsoft and LinkedIn, watch: Azure cloud is the other key area Microsoft must push hard in 2017 and no one doubts that it will do so. Forrester Research forr principal analyst Dave Bartoletti says the software giant has thus far executed very well in cloud with a huge investment, he noted. Very few other tech companies can &#8220;find&#8221; $5 or $6 billion to pour into cloud data centers, he added. Microsoft&#8217;s effort to make Azure, a massive stockpile of connected servers and storage running in data centers worldwide, a home to open-source software including the Linux operating system, formerly anathema to the Windows company, has also helped make the company&#8217;s cloud more attractive to developers outside the hard-core Windows world. Having said that, the company needs to demonstrate more Azure usage going forward. Azure is seen as the second largest public cloud, but a distant second to AWS. Microsoft claims huge cloud growth but the numbers it releases lump Azure in with other non-cloud software including Windows Server that run on premises. the world will likely not get a real look at how much money Azure generates until Microsoft breaks out that figure, and that probably won&#8217;t happen till the Azure numbers compare well with AWS revenue, which, for the most recent quarter, was $3.2 billion. Microsoft has a compelling story here if customers can run the same set of Microsoft software in their own server rooms that runs in Azure. That would mean that risk-averse companies like banks or pharmaceutical companies could keep some data and = software running on their own hardware, while tapping into Microsoft Azure data centers as needed for less sensitive work. That mix of private and public computing facilities is what is referred to in the tech industry as the hybrid cloud model. Get Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s daily technology newsletter. However, Microsoft can&#8217;t really deliver on that promise until the middle of 2017. That&#8217;s when the company says it will make Azure Stack available, after a delay. Azure Stack is a sort of &#8220;mini-me&#8221; version of the software Microsoft uses to run its huge public cloud data centers around the world, but will instead operate in a customer&#8217;s own smaller facilities. In theory, that means the customer&#8217;s private data centers can work in tandem with the Microsoft-run Azure cloud allowing a segregation of workloads between internal and outside data centers. This is a very big promise. If Microsoft cannot make good on it, one of its biggest arguments that it offers a better cloud solution for risk-averse customers than AWS will ring hollow.","rendered":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ffortune.com\u002Ffortune500\u002Fmicrosoft-25\u002F\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EMicrosoft\u003C\u002Fa\u003E has become Wall Street&#8217;s darling again after\u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.vanityfair.com\u002Fnews\u002Fbusiness\u002F2012\u002F08\u002Fmicrosoft-lost-mojo-steve-ballmer\"\u003E a few rough years\u003C\u002Fa\u003E in the late Steve Ballmer era.

Amazon is assembling masses of &#8220;bare metal&#8221; computers, which unlike the rest of the AWS servers, come with no virtualization. That&#8217;s because VMware&#8217;s software is built using its own flavor of virtualization and that, in turn, meant AWS had to offer VMware a phalanx of servers stripped of the Xen virtualization, which runs the rest of Amazon&#8217;s computers, known collectively as Elastic Compute Cloud or EC2. As AWS head of product Matt Wood explained it to Fortune in November: We partnered with VMware to bring their existing software stack over to EC2. Customers told us they wanted the benefits of AWS and all the benefits of VMware, but didn&#8217;t want to run our hypervisor so we worked on a new part of EC2 that allows VMware to run natively on EC2. Think of VMware as offering a peanut butter and jelly sandwich using its customers&#8217; bread. Now the customer wants to use Amazon&#8217;s bread, except that the only bread Amazon offers comes with the peanut butter built in. Continuing this analogy, Amazon has agreed to strip the peanut butter from many loaves so VMware can craft sandwiches using its own special PB&amp;J formulation on Amazon&#8217;s bread. In theory, that means all those big business customers\u2014and there are many\u2014that use VMware vmw to run their own data centers can more easily forklift their workloads over to AWS data centers using the upcoming product known as VMware cloud for AWS. That&#8217;s an attractive proposition for companies that just want to keep running their virtualized applications as is, instead of re-jiggering them to run on Amazon&#8217;s infrastructure. Virtualization, which lets one set of hardware run more than one set of tasks, is a key linchpin of cloud computing, which is why bare metal is seen as sort of uncloudy. Get Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter When this bare metal work was announced in October, it was painted as a VMware-only option. But there are potentially other big uses for those Xen-free AWS servers. Bare metal, for example, tends to be faster than virtualized hardware for applications like databases that send a lot of data in and out of disk storage. &#8220;There&#8217;s also a growing trend to put containers on bare metal to save on virtualization licensing costs and overhead, but that&#8217;s usually for private cloud,&#8221; says Sebastian Stadil, chief executive of Scalr, a cloud management company. Containers are a modern way developers package up software applications that can run almost anywhere. Bare metal is also useful for older, but still important applications that can&#8217;t be virtualized for various reasons, he notes. Clearly, others have seen opportunity. IBM ibm and Rackspace offer bare metal along with other more heavily-virtualized cloud options. When asked in November if AWS had other potential uses for these bare metal servers, Wood replied there was &#8220;nothing to announce at this time.&#8221; Opinion is mixed among AWS watchers if the company will parlay this bare metal capability beyond VMware or simply use it as a way to attract VMware customers to Amazon data centers and then\u2014as some suspect\u2014try to move them completely to Amazon (minus VMware). &#8220;It would be reasonable to assume that, once those workloads reach AWS, there is value in beginning to rearchitect some (maybe even all, one day) of them to run natively on AWS\u2019 own infrastructure, without the overhead of a VMware license,&#8221; says Paul Miller, a senior analyst with Forrester Research. Sateesh Narahari, vice president of products for Managed Methods, a cloud security company, also views those VMware bare metal instances &#8220;as a transitional state to going full cloud.&#8221; It&#8217;s possible that not even AWS execs know yet what will happen. The cloud giant is nothing if not pragmatic. If Amazon amzn sees opportunity once VMware for AWS Cloud materializes in the middle of 2017, it will capitalize on it. For more on Amazon and VMware, watch: &#8220;If AWS can make the economics and infrastructure management work\u2014and they tend to be good at that\u2014it does seem plausible that we&#8217;ll see a generic AWS bare metal offering sooner rather than later,&#8221; says Forrester&#8217;s Miller.","rendered":"\u003Cp\u003EOne surprising thing about what \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ffortune.com\u002F2016\u002F10\u002F05\u002Fvmware-amazon-cloud-pact\u002F\"\u003EAmazon Web Services\u003C\u002Fa\u003E has done \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ffortune.com\u002F2016\u002F10\u002F14\u002Faws-and-vmware-winners-losers\u002F\"\u003Eto run VMware&#8217;s popular virtualization software\u003C\u002Fa\u003E in its own cloud data centers is just how&#8230;un-cloud-like it seems.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ffortune.com\u002Ffortune500\u002Famazoncom-18\u002F\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EAmazon\u003C\u002Fa\u003E is assembling masses of &#8220;bare metal&#8221; computers, which unlike the rest of the AWS servers, come with no virtualization.

Once a T-Mobile customer installs the update, the Note 7 will no longer be able to charge or connect to networks. AT&amp;T, Verizon, and Sprint will also be sending out the update in coming weeks. The update also displays a reminder that the Note 7 has been recalled and instructions for returning the phone. T-Mobile tmus and Samsung, along with other carriers, agreed to take the unprecedented step of issuing the killer update after some Note 7 owners continued to use their devices despite the recall and many dozens of incidents of batteries exploding, smoking, or catching fire. About 7% of the Note 7 devices sold in the United States were still in use two weeks ago, Samsung said. Get Data Sheet, Fortune&#8217;s technology newsletter. Verizon vz and AT&amp;T t will start distributing the update on January 5. Sprint s will roll it out beginning on January 8. Anyone who bought a Note 7, which has a 5.7- inch screen and comes with a stylus, can return the device to the store or carrier where they bought it and exchange it for a different model or get a refund. Samsung is offering a $100 bill credit to customers who exchange a Note 7 for another Samsung smartphone. Customers who want a refund or opt for another brand qualify for a $25 credit. The Note 7 went on sale in August, but was quickly beset by reports of batteries smoking and catching fire. On September 2, Samsung said it was voluntarily recalling 2.5 million of the devices that had been shipped up to that point.

The company&#8217;s app, which buyers of new bands must download to set up and use their Fitbits, reached No. 2 among all free apps on Apple&#8217;s iPhone app store on Tuesday, behind only Super Mario Run. And it reached No. 8 overall among free apps in Google&#8217;s googl Play store. With the positive signs from the app stores, Fitbit shares fit gained 8% on Tuesday to close at $7.83. Still, at just under $8 a share, the stock price is 39% below where it was last month when the company announced disappointing guidance for holiday sales. In the past, Fitbit sales typically explode in the holiday shopping period; the company&#8217;s revenue increased 92% in the fourth quarter of last year compared to 2014. But on Nov. 2, CEO James Park warned that manufacturing problems and a downturn in China would limit growth and sales for this fourth quarter to only 2% to 5% higher than last year. Fitbit&#8217;s shares tumbled 30% within minutes on the news followed by additional declines over the next few weeks. Get Data Sheet, Fortune&#8217;s technology newsletter. Park has made several moves to get growth back on track, including the recent purchase of the assets of defunct&nbsp;smartwatch maker Pebble. Fitbit is planning to add more smartwatch-like features to its fitness trackers, as rival Apple aapl has focused more on the health and fitness features. For more on Fitbit&#8217;s push towards employers, watch: It is possible that the strong app download data alone may overstate Fitbit&#8217;s position, however. The app data represents &#8220;considerable holiday gift purchases and related installs,&#8221; CFRA Research analyst Scott Kessler wrote, but not enough to significantly change the stock market&#8217;s long-term opinion about the company&#8217;s value. And Fitbit was not mentioned by Amazon amzn as among the most popular wearables sold by the e-commerce site, he noted. That list was dominated by products from Garmin grmn , probably the most athlete-focused of the wearables makers. It may take some hot new products for investors to really get excited about the stock.

Why Microsoft Could Beat Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet to $1 Trillion Mark"},"content":{"plain":"Microsoft&#8217;s $26 billion purchase of LinkedIn gives it a shot to beat Apple, Google parent company Alphabet, Facebook, and Amazon to be the first digital company to hit a $1 trillion market capitalization, according to a research note by Equities.com analyst Michael Markowski. As of Friday, Microsoft msft held the third largest market cap at $494.6 billion after Apple aapl at $618 billion, and Alphabet googl at $548 billion. Amazon amzn and Facebook fb rounded out the top five with market caps of $366 billion and $343.1 billion, respectively. Markowski thinks the LinkedIn purchase will boost Microsoft&#8217;s prospects over rivals for a few reasons, one of which relates to rulings earlier this year by the U.S. Securities &amp; Exchange Commission that will allow more online crowdsourcing of startups. He expects that will lead to an uptick in social investing because companies will be able to advertise directly to prospective individual investors. LinkedIn, with its database of more that 467 million people will come in very handy there. Microsoft, he continues, will be well positioned &#8220;to play a key role in the new social investing industry which is the key to drive crowdfunding to ubiquity.&#8221; Get Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter. Markowski expects the social investing community will become as large as the entire social media segment the next decade. &#8220;Microsoft, with its ownership of LinkedIn, is extremely well positioned to be a major player,&#8221; Markowski writes. &#8220;It has a monopoly on the business social media niche or community.&#8221; Microsoft has another advantage in that it has $27 billion in free cash flow for the trailing twelve months compared to $23.4 billion for Alphabet, $10 billion for Amazon, and $8.5 billion for Facebook. This is an important metric in that it represents the amount of money a company can pull together after capital expenditures to make acquisitions or otherwise invest to improve its business. The LinkedIn deal has yet to play out, but Microsoft is entering year four under chief executive Satya Nadella, has been headed in a very stable direction of late. Its stock hit an all-time high in October, reflecting investor optimism.

iPhone Rumors Hint at a New Mid-Sized Model"},"content":{"plain":"With about nine months to go until Apple&#8217;s expected annual iPhone upgrade announcement, rumors from the company&#8217;s Asian supply chain are intensifying. On Tuesday, unnamed supply chain sources told Apple news blog Mac Otakara in Taiwan that Apple is working on three new models for 2017. Entering the current line up of phones with 4.7- and and 5.5-inch screens could be a new medium-sized model with a 5-inch screen that also includes the dual-lens camera currently only found on the larger screen Plus model. Other sources, including well-regarded analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities, have also reported a third model will be added to the line. But while Kuo has written that only the new model would boast higher-end specs and a brand new edge-to-edge OLED screen, Mac Otakara reported all three phones would contain identical technology. Get Data Sheet, Fortune&#8217;s technology newsletter. The report also included the caveat that Apple will not make a final decision on the complete 2017 iPhone designs until the company&#8217;s second fiscal quarter, which runs through the end of March. Apple&#8217;s iPhone sales 13% shrunk in the first nine months of this year after the company abandon its practice of overhauling the external design of the iPhone every other year and went with a similar design for the third consecutive year. The iPhone 7, introduced in early September, carried almost the same design externally as last year&#8217;s iPhone 6s and 2014&#8217;s iPhone 6. For the holiday quarter, analysts expect Apple might do a little better than last year, when tight supplies hurt sales, but not enough to prevent the first full year of lower sales. Analysts and investors have been hoping for a major overhaul by Apple aapl to attract more upgraders in 2017, with some predicting for a &#8220;super cycle&#8221; based on rumors about major changes, like OLED screens and wireless charging capability.

In tech, the semiconductor industry has rapidly consolidated while mid-sized players like EMC and LinkedIn were gobbled up by larger peers. But there&#8217;s still some potentially massive deals to come in 2017 that may not have even been imaginable in 2016. Call it the Trump bump for tech M&amp;A. Under President Obama&#8217;s watch, regulators at the Department of Justice&#8217;s antitrust division and the Federal Communications Commission stepped in to block a bevy of combinations that they argued would reduce competition and hurt consumers. The moves stopped Comcast from buying Time Warner Cable, and prevented T-Mobile from going to AT&amp;T or Sprint. Now President-elect Donald Trump is signaling with his transition appointments and general pro-business stance that a lot more combinations may be acceptable. David Higbee, an M&amp;A lawyer at Hunton &amp; Williams who worked in the Bush administration, is helping to oversee Trump&#8217;s Justice Department transition, along with economist and Republican Federal Trade Commission member Joshua Wright. Both are seen as tilting much more pro-merger than Obama&#8217;s appointees. The same is true of Trump&#8217;s three transition team members overseeing the FCC. Further fueling merger mania, Trump is also widely expected to work with the Republican majority in Congress to slash the tax on corporate overseas profits. Companies like Apple aapl and Microsoft msft have accumulated hundreds of billions of dollars in overseas profits that can&#8217;t be brought back to the United States without a 35% tax. Trump could slash the rate to 10%, providing the biggest tech companies with a lot of dough to make deals. Get Data Sheet, Fortune&#8217;s technology newsletter. Bottom line? Telecom industry analyst Simon Flannery at Morgan Stanley ms is hardly alone in expecting &#8220;a prolonged period of M&amp;A activity given the more benign regulatory outlook.&#8221; The most talked-about potential 2017 deal revolves around T-Mobile, the third-largest wireless carrier and the company that has added more subscribers over the past few years than the rest of the industry combined. Not only could Sprint s dream of buying T-Mobile tmus under Trump, but big cable companies like Comcast cmcsa or Charter Communications chtr , which plan to enter the wireless market next year, may also be bidders. If the bidders want to go after a smaller target U.S. Cellular usm could be in play, as well. Analysts think the cable players may be more likely to make a deal at this point that Sprint and its majority owner Softbank Group, already coping with massive debt from earlier moves. And T-Mobile&#8217;s outspoken CEO John Legere says his talks with tech giants have convinced him that the ultimate landing spot for his company may be in Silicon Valley with the likes of Google googl or Facebook fb . Further consolidation could also come to the data center market, where current antitrust overseers might oppose acquisitions by the biggest companies. But under Trump, while Google, Microsoft, and Amazon amzn dominate, smaller players like Equinix eqix , Digital Realty Trust dlr , and CyrusOne cone could be fodder for acquisitions. Related: Trump vs. Tech: It\u2019s Going to Get Rockier The Trump hints have some analysts dreaming much bigger. Perhaps Sprint and T-Mobile will merge, while also picking up Dish Network dish , analyst Timothy Horan, at Oppenheimer &amp; Co, hypothesized earlier his month. The triple combo could &#8220;create a discounted quad-play service company with over 300 MHz of spectrum,&#8221; Horan wrote. That in turn could lead Comcast and Verizon vz possibly to merge and AT&amp;T t then might buy parts of CenturyLink ctl , Frontier Communications ftr or Windstream win , Horan said. Verizon&#8217;s planned $4.8 billion deal for Yahoo isn&#8217;t go well after a second major hacking revelation, so the carrier could be in the market for other acquisitions to bolster its digital advertising strategy, analysts say. Possible targets for CEO Lowell McAdam could include music service Pandora Media p or struggling social network Twitter twtr , BTIG Research analyst Walt Piecyk told Bloomberg News. Other combinations that have been tossed about seem less plausible. Even if pro-business regulators allowed Amazon to buy Barnes &amp; Noble bks , why would the House of Bezos want to add the huge and ailing book chain to its assets? And while Apple could get a huge tax windfall of repatriated cash under Trump, buying rumored targets Netflix nflx or Tesla tsla would cost a fortune and wreck its price-to-earnings ratio. What about the biggest deal announced in 2016? On the campaign trail, Trump promised to block AT&amp;T&#8217;s $109 billion Time Warner twx acquisition. &#8220;AT&amp;T is buying Time Warner and thus CNN, a deal we will not approve in my administration because it&#8217;s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few,&#8221; Trump said in a speech in October. For more on opposition to AT&amp;T&#8217;s Time Warner deal, watch: But signs continue to emerge that Trump may be backing off the pledge. AT&amp;T officials who talked with transition officials came away confident the deal could survive, the Financial Times reported earlier this month. In the era of Trump, it seems many more deals are within the realm of possibility\u2014even ones the President-elect himself has once opposed.","rendered":"\u003Cp\u003EThe past few years have been extremely busy in the world of mergers and acquisitions, setting records around the world.

Lessons learned the hard way by early adopters become tweaks and improvements to benefit subsequent revised models. Get Data Sheet, Fortune&#8217;s technology newsletter. And there&#8217;s probably a similar lesson for computer and gadget buyers: early adopters be damned. This week, Consumer Reports turned its sights on Apple&#8217;s newest MacBook Pro laptop line. The first major overhaul since Apple introduced Retina Display screens in 2012, the new lineup features a thinner, more squared off body, the elimination of almost all ports but the USB-C connector, and the cool looking &#8220;Touch Bar&#8221; screen atop the keyboard. The internals were also completely revamped, from the addition of sixth generation Intel &#8220;Skylake&#8221; processors to faster solid state disks and lighter batteries. Many early reviews loved the new machines. &#8220;The best laptop ever made just changed the scene forever,&#8221; Digital Spy raved. &#8220;Well worth splurging,&#8221; CNET concluded. &#8220;Solid performers,&#8221; if a bit overpriced, Macworld found. But as Consumer Reports\u2014and a few others\u2014uncovered through careful testing, something appears highly amiss in the newly designed battery system. While Apple claims up to 10 hours of battery life in typical usage, testers in the Consumer Reports lab found incredibly varied results on three models they had purchased at a retail store. &#8220;In a series of three consecutive tests, the 13-inch model with the Touch Bar ran for 16 hours in the first trial, 12.75 hours in the second, and just 3.75 hours in the third,&#8221; the group wrote in its review. &#8220;The 13-inch model without the Touch Bar worked for 19.5 hours in one trial but only 4.5 hours in the next. And the numbers for the 15-inch laptop ranged from 18.5 down to 8 hours.&#8221; For more on the introduction of the new MacBook Pro, watch: And as a result of the unreliable battery life, for the first time in the history of Apple&#8217;s MacBook line, Consumer Reports declined to give the 2016 models a rating of &#8220;recommended.&#8221; Hardly the most exclusive of raters, Consumer Reports currently has 66 different laptops of varying screen sizes on its &#8220;recommended&#8221; list, including seven older Apple models. Late on Friday, Apple senior vice president Phil Schiller took to Twitter to say that Apple was talking to Consumer Reports about the test results. &#8220;Working with CR to understand their battery tests,&#8221; Schiller wrote. &#8220;Results do not match our extensive lab tests or field data.&#8221; There&#8217;s little doubt that Apple aapl has already turned its vast might and resources to address the battery shortcoming and probably a bunch of other complaints, dings, and nitpicks from MacBook Pro reviewers. Some fixes may come through software updates, but as with cars, the real solutions and big improvements probably will have to wait for next year&#8217;s refresh.

Based on a very informal poll of about two dozen colleagues and friends, nearly everyone agrees that that LinkedIn&#8217;s database is an incredible trove of information about current or prospective employees or employers. It&#8217;s useful for finding and keeping in touch with long-lost colleagues, or finding potential new job or filling job openings. LinkedIn claims 467 million registered users, with two new people joining every second, although it does not disclose how many pay. Only one of the respondents says she&#8217;s quit the business-focused social network, deleting her account. Other than that, here are some suggestions. Fix the Interface There were lots of complaints about the user interface, which is clumsy and seems in a constant state of flux. &#8220;They keep changing it,&#8221; says Catherine Marenghi, a Boston area public relations executive and author. It is very hard to find things\u2014like support, she adds. To be fair, LinkedIn is already on this. In September, the company outlined plans for a desktop redesign, due early next year. Go Easy on the Spam The biggest complaint seems to be LinkedIn&#8217;s propensity to &#8220;spam&#8221; users, requesting more contacts\u2014a feature that thankfully can now be turned off\u2014and reminding them to send birthday wishes or holiday greetings to long-lost colleagues. Jeff Shuey, a former executive at Eastman Kodak kodk and K2 Software, likes finding and keeping in touch with former colleagues with LinkedIn. What he doesn&#8217;t like? &#8220;Birthday wishes. This is not Facebook fb people!&#8221; Kill Endorsements The myriad of requests to &#8220;endorse&#8221; contacts is a source of chagrin. No one said they pay any attention to these endorsements. &#8220;The endorsements are absolute crap,&#8221; says Yuval Shavit, a Boston-area software engineer via email. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been endorsed for technologies that I have no experience in. For instance, languages that I have literally never written a single line in. LinkedIn does a bad job curating the info about its users.&#8221; Said another wag: &#8220;I love getting endorsements on skills I don&#8217;t have from people I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; You can kill endorsements, although it&#8217;s not intuitive how to do so, and you have to wonder if they random endorsements have value. Beef up the Mobile App A vice president of a global healthcare organization based on the East Coast finds LinkedIn&#8217;s mobile app less than inspiring. &#8220;The most annoying bug is when you get a notification in mobile email and click the link to take whatever action, the mobile app opens and takes you to your home page. It should behave like the desktop browser app and let you complete whatever the action is,&#8221; he said. (This executive requested anonymity because he is not authorized to speak about the company&#8217;s IT use.) Now the Good News The social network also got some rave reviews, mostly from people who pay for advanced versions for recruitment or marketing Dee Dee Walsh, vice president of marketing for Mobilize.net, a Bellevue, Wash. company that helps migrate older software to the Web, uses LinkedIn all the time both to recruit new employees and for marketing. &#8220;When I place an ad, it\u2019s really effective especially for non-technical jobs. I get a lot of really great candidates because I can target by title, by keyword, by group,&#8221; she noted. It&#8217;s less effective than Stackoverflow for technical or engineering candidates, but she thinks Microsoft msft ownership could help there. Get Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter. Google&#8217;s googl advertising products let companies buy keywords, but doesn&#8217;t allow targeting to this degree, Walsh continues. She also looked at Rainking and DiscoverOrg databases of prospective IT buyers within companies, but they don&#8217;t let her fine tune her searches the way LinkedIn does, she says. For marketing, sales, and recruiting, the ability to really pinpoint searches is critical. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be a pest to people, although I know I am. LinkedIn helps me be a pest to the right people,&#8221; Walsh tells Fortune. Marketers can embed LinkedIn code on their websites which then provides them with the LinkedIn profile of any visitor, a very common usage of the product. The reports on web site visitors that LinkedIn provides are very useful, several marketing executives said. For more on Microsoft-LinkedIn, watch: The thing about LinkedIn for many users is that it cuts both ways. &#8220;I don&#8217;t like that LinkedIn will tell people when I&#8217;ve stalked them. Though, I do like knowing who is stalking me,&#8221; says Jennifer Cloer, founder of reTHINKit PR in Portland Oregon. She got back to Fortune later to note that she learned how to switch her privacy settings to incognito, so she can stalk people surreptitiously going forward. LinkedIn&#8217;s strength lies in the data it holds on millions of people. But that can lead to problems: How does it surface the most relevant stuff and promote interaction without bombarding people with minutia? And now that Microsoft plans to integrate LinkedIn with Office, Outlook and other tentpole products, as noted by LinkedIn chief executive Jeff Weiner, it must also weigh concerns of users about exposing so much of their information to a broader audience. It may be great for Microsoft Dynamics CRM users who want to pump possible leads into their sales application, but may also turn off users who can vote with their feet to turn off the network if it gets too obtrusive. If you love the sponsored content you now see in LinkedIn, you may rejoice that you&#8217;ll soon see it across Microsoft properties going forward. But, if you find it pointless, you may not be happy. And finally, while no one brought this up, given that LinkedIn had to reset 55,000 passwords for users of its Lynda.com online education site early this week, it seems the company and its new parent have work to do on the security front. But then again, who doesn&#8217;t?","rendered":"\u003Cp\u003ENow that Microsoft&#8217;s \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ffortune.com\u002F2016\u002F06\u002F13\u002Fmicrosoft-buying-linkedin\u002F\"\u003E$26 billion purchase of LinkedIn\u003C\u002Fa\u003E is \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ffortune.com\u002F2016\u002F12\u002F08\u002Fsatya-nadella-microsoft-linkedin\u002F\"\u003Efinal\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, here are some suggestions for things that Microsoft chief executive officer Satya Nadella could do to improve the huge\u2014but sometimes annoying\u2014business network.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBased on a \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C\u002Fem\u003E informal poll of about two dozen colleagues and friends, nearly everyone agrees that that LinkedIn&#8217;s database is an incredible trove of information about current or prospective employees or employers.

Trump posted his Twitter message a day after the president-elect met with the chief executives of both aerospace companies, using the bully pulpit to press them on projects he says are too expensive. In after-hours trading following Trump&#8217;s tweet, Lockheed shares fell 2 percent and Boeing&#8217;s rose 0.7%. &#8220;Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!&#8221; Trump said. Lockheed declined to comment. The F-35 program is a critical sales generator for the company, accounting for 20 percent of last year&#8217;s revenue of $46.1 billion. The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Boeing spokesman Todd Blecher said in an email that the company was committed to providing the capability and affordability to meet national security needs. While the F-35 program has been dogged by problems and costs have escalated to an estimated $379 billion, it is significantly newer than the F-18, which does not have the same stealth capabilities. &#8220;They&#8217;re two completely different aircraft from different generations,&#8221; said Phillip Carter, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington-based think tank. &#8220;It&#8217;s like comparing an old jeep to a Humvee.&#8221; Dan Grazier of the Project on Government Oversight, a nonprofit that investigates government contractors, said the F-35&#8217;s stealth capabilities drove the cost up, but its usefulness had not yet been demonstrated. He said canceling the program, however, would be &#8220;disruptive.&#8221; On the campaign trail, Trump touted his negotiating skills as a businessman, and he appears to be using similar tactics as he prepares to take office on Jan. 20. It was not clear how his blunt style would translate to Pentagon procurement or international diplomacy. On Wednesday, Trump met the CEOs of Lockheed and Boeing at his resort in Palm Beach, Florida. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg told reporters there that he had guaranteed costs would not get out of control for a replacement to Air Force One, the presidential plane, another project Trump calls too expensive. Lockheed Chief Executive Marillyn Hewson did not speak to reporters but said in a statement that the meeting was &#8220;productive.&#8221; Trump told reporters he wanted to cut the F-35 program&#8217;s costs. If he scrapped the F-35, such a move by a new administration would have some precedent. Then-President Jimmy Carter canceled the B-1 bomber program in June 1977, although it was resurrected by his White House successor, Ronald Reagan. Trump&#8217;s jockeying for leverage via his Twitter account is likely to be a hurdle for all U.S. defense contractors in the next administration, Roman Schweizer, aerospace and defense analyst at financial services firm Cowen &amp; Co, wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. &#8220;We have no idea how this plays out but believe &#8216;Twitter risk&#8217; for defense companies could be a significant issue over the next four years,&#8221; Schweizer wrote. &#8220;This is Lockheed Martin&#8217;s time in the barrel.&#8221;","rendered":"\u003Cp class=\"p1\"\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"s1\"\u003EU.S. President-elect Donald Trump heaped pressure on \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ffortune.com\u002Ffortune500\u002Flockheed-martin-60\u002F\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ELockheed Martin\u003C\u002Fa\u003E \u003Cspan class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"lmt\"\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\u003Cspan class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\"\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003Ca class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ffortune.com\u002Ffortune500\u002Flockheed-martin-60\u002F\"\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003Cspan class=\"ticker\"\u003Elmt\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003Cspan class=\"change percent\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\n\t\t\t\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E on Thursday, saying he viewed costs for the aerospace company&#8217;s F-35 fighter as too high and had asked \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ffortune.com\u002Ffortune500\u002Fboeing-24\u002F\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EBoeing\u003C\u002Fa\u003E \u003Cspan class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"ba\"\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\u003Cspan class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\"\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003Ca class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ffortune.com\u002Ffortune500\u002Fboeing-24\u002F\"\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003Cspan class=\"ticker\"\u003Eba\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003Cspan class=\"change percent\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\n\t\t\t\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E to offer a price for an older aircraft that lacks the same stealth capabilities.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"p1\"\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"s1\"\u003ETrump posted his Twitter message a day after the president-elect met with the chief executives of both aerospace companies, using the bully pulpit to press them on projects he says are too expensive.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"p1\"\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"s1\"\u003EIn after-hours trading following Trump&#8217;s tweet, Lockheed shares fell 2 percent and Boeing&#8217;s rose 0.7%.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"p1\"\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"s1\"\u003E&#8220;Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!&#8221; Trump said.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"p1\"\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"s1\"\u003ELockheed declined to comment.

By the end of the first quarter of 2017, Fortune has learned there will be 27 women leading Fortune 500 companies. While that is an undeniably paltry number, it&#8217;s better than the number of female CEOs in 2016\u2014or ever. The previous record for most female CEOs on the list was set in 2014, when 24 women made the list. This number stayed unchanged the following two years (as of December 2016), meaning that the percentage of women at the top of the Fortune 500 has been holding steady at 4.8%. While we will see a few female chiefs stepping down next year, these losses will be offset by a number of powerful businesswomen stepping up to take their places. For the first time ever, more than 5% of CEOs on the list will be women. Subscribe to the Broadsheet, Fortune\u2019s daily newsletter on the world\u2019s most powerful women. NEWCOMERS 1.

Third-Party Sellers Had Record-Breaking Sales in 2016"},"content":{"plain":"Amazon.com amzn shipped 50 percent more items this holiday season than last for third-party vendors and doubled the amount for 2016 overall, the retail giant said on Wednesday. The news offers new data points for investors who are hoping Amazon will post a profit for the fourth quarter when it announces results in the coming weeks. Seattle-based Amazon, known for its roller coaster results in years past, has forecast that operating income would range from nothing to $1.25 billion. Amazon, the world&#8217;s largest online retailer, has said the 2016 holiday was its best-ever shopping season. However, high spending on warehouses and video production are expected to drag on profits. More sellers are paying the company to store, pack and ship their goods through the Fulfillment by Amazon service. Amazon more than doubled the items it delivered for other sellers in 2016 from the year prior to exceed two billion, a spokesman said. Active sellers using the fulfillment service rose more than 70 percent in the year, Amazon said on Wednesday. It did not specify the total number of vendors. &nbsp; Third-party sales were &#8220;record-breaking&#8221; in 2016, Peter Faricy, vice president for Amazon Marketplace, said in the statement. Amazon takes a cut of the proceeds. Amazon will likely top its profit-margin guidance for the fourth quarter, Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy said in a research note last week. Price competition seemed subdued in December and Amazon avoided delivery bottlenecks it experienced in 2015, he said. Cyber Monday, a shopping spree four days after Thanksgiving, is another indicator. Shoppers ordered more than 28 million items from third-party sellers this year, versus more than 23 million items on Cyber Monday in 2015, Amazon said. Amazon is building its own fleet of planes to handle the rise in orders and supplement shipping that it contracts out to companies like FedEx Corp and United Parcel Service Inc . Data reviewed by Reuters and interviews with airport officials show that Amazon has loaded these aircraft with big but lightweight boxes, helping it dodge fees from cargo carriers increasingly pricing based on volume rather than weight.

tightly linked the economies of Canada and the United States are, amid fears of a protectionist Trump administration. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who has promised to either renegotiate or scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), has said overhauling trade policy will be a top priority after he takes office on Jan. 20. Canada sends 75% of its exports to the United States and could suffer from changes to NAFTA, which also includes Mexico. Ford Motor f on Tuesday scrapped a planned Mexican car factory and added 700 jobs in Michigan following criticism by Trump, who turned his attention toward General Motors gm with the threat of a &#8220;big border tax&#8221; over compact cars made in Mexico. In the video address, Trudeau and David MacNaughton, the Canadian ambassador to Washington, stressed the closeness of ties between the neighbors. &#8220;We&#8217;ve built an economic relationship that supports jobs in every Congressional district. We are the largest international customer for goods and services made in the USA,&#8221; said Trudeau, who was filmed in his office in front of the U.S. and Canadian flags. MacNaughton said Canada was ready to work with Congress to make the lives of citizens in both nations better and more prosperous. Christine Constantin, a spokeswoman for the Canadian embassy in Washington, said ambassadors had sent video greetings to the two previous opening sessions of Congress. For more on Canada-U.S. relations, watch Fortune&#8217;s video: Trudeau, who has made ties with the United States a priority, was asked by the embassy to appear in the video, she said. Trudeau spokesman Cameron Ahmad declined to elaborate on the video, saying the prime minister&#8217;s message spoke for itself.

But not all are keen to connect with systems developed by Apple or Google. Ford Motor f and Toyota Motor tm have formed a consortium to accelerate the deployment of open source software aimed at giving consumers more options in how they connect and control their smartphone apps. The organization is called the SmartDeviceLink (SDL) Consortium, a reference to an open source software version of Ford&#8217;s AppLink. Mazda Motor mzday , PSA Group, Fuji Heavy Industries fujhy , and Suzuki Motor szkmy , are the first automaker members of the consortium. Suppliers Elektrobit ebttf , Harman har , Luxoft lxft , QNX, and Xevo have also joined the nonprofit organization. Get Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter. The formation of the consortium follows Toyota&#8217;s announcement last January that it planned to use the SDL software in its cars to give drivers command and control of smartphone apps through dashboard buttons, display screens, and voice recognition tech. Toyota plans to commercialize an infotainment system using SDL around 2018. The unusual agreement between the typically competitive companies showed the wariness of some automakers to hand over control to third-party companies\u2014namely Apple aapl and Google googl . Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are two connectivity systems that allow a smartphone to take over a car\u2019s center screen. Once users plug their smartphones into the car\u2019s USB ports, the phones&#8217; maps and navigation, music, and selected apps are integrated onto the central screen. Ford and Toyota argue that an open source code is a better approach, because developers and automakers working together can increase the quality and security of the software. If the industry adopts the software, developers would gain access to millions of vehicles and their drivers worldwide, while participating companies would still be able to retain control over the level of access outside parties have to vehicle data, the companies said. Ford has abandoned Apple&#8217;s and Google&#8217;s offerings, however. The company has taken an all-of-the-above approach to connectivity in the car.

Cancels a $1.6 Billion Mexico Plant and Adds 700 Jobs in Michigan"},"content":{"plain":"Ford Motor Co f on Tuesday scrapped a planned Mexican car factory and added 700 jobs in Michigan following criticism by Donald Trump, as the U.S. president-elect turned his attention toward rival General Motors Co with the threat of a &#8220;big border tax&#8221; over compact cars made in Mexico. Ford CEO Mark Fields called the move &#8220;a vote of confidence&#8221; in Trump, but primarily a response to a decline in North American demand for small cars like those that would have been made at the Mexican plant. He said Ford would have made the same decision even if Trump had not been elected. Ford will cancel plans unveiled in April to spend $1.6 billion to build the new plant in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, a project Trump urged the automaker to abandon and called an &#8220;absolute disgrace&#8221; during the election campaign. The No. 2 U.S. automaker also said it would invest $700 million to expand the Flat Rock, Michigan factory and would make new electric, hybrid and autonomous vehicles there. Trump&#8217;s efforts to browbeat the U.S. car industry show he may go further than other modern presidents to try to influence corporate decisions, especially those related to trade and investment. In a Twitter post hours before Ford&#8217;s announcement, Trump wrote, &#8220;General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!&#8221; GM, the largest U.S. automaker, said making some of the Cruze cars in the plant in Coahuila, Mexico was part of its strategy to serve global customers, not sell those vehicles in the United States. Trump&#8217;s GM tweet was his latest broadside aimed at an American company over jobs, imports and costs even before he takes office on Jan. 20. Mexico&#8217;s government said it regrets Ford&#8217;s decision and has ensured that the company will reimburse San Luis Potosi state for any costs associated with the investment. &#8220;Obviously, this isn&#8217;t a good decision for us,&#8221; said Mexico&#8217;s economy minister, Ildefonso Guajardo. Ford said it still will shift production from Michigan of its Focus compact car to an existing plant in Hermosillo, Mexico. Fields said he expects Michigan to give incentives for Ford&#8217;s investment in Flat Rock. Ford spokeswoman Jennifer Flake said the automaker will save $500 million by not opening the new plant in the near term, but will have some undisclosed costs to retool the other Mexican plant to build the Focus. Ford shares closed up about 3.8 percent. GM shares rose about 0.9 percent. TRUMP NOTIFIED Top Ford executives personally notified Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence of their decision. Fields praised tax and regulatory proposals advocated by Trump and his fellow Republicans who control Congress. &#8220;Our view is that we see a more positive U.S. manufacturing business environment under President-elect Trump and the pro-growth policies and proposals that he&#8217;s talking about, so this is a vote of confidence for President-elect Trump and some of the policies that they may be pursuing,&#8221; Fields said. Union workers gathered at the Flat Rock factory cheered Fields&#8217; announcement. Hiring of the 700 new workers there will probably start in 2018 with the majority of it in 2020, Fields said. Trump said during the presidential campaign that if elected he would not allow Ford to open the new plant in Mexico and would slap hefty tariffs on imported Ford vehicles. Trump also accused Mexico of sending criminals and rapists into the United States and vowed to build a border wall to combat illegal immigration. Since winning the Nov. 8 election, Trump has targeted a wide range of American companies also including United Technologies Inc, Boeing Co and Lockheed Martin Corp. Trump also has touted decisions by companies to keep some production in the United States, including United&#8217;s Carrier unit in Indiana. Trump previously vowed to hit companies that shift production from America to other countries with a 35 percent tax on their exports into the United States. He also has denounced the North American Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Mexico and Canada. Fields said there were no negotiations between Ford and the incoming president over canceling the Mexico plant or investing in Michigan. Ford will build a battery electric SUV with a 300-mile (482-km) driving range at the Michigan plant by 2020, and will launch production there by 2021 of a fully autonomous vehicle without a steering wheel or a brake pedal for use in ride services fleets. Ford also plans new hybrid versions of its F-150 pickup truck, Mustang and police vehicles by 2020. GM said it sold about 190,000 Cruze cars in the United States in 2016. All of the sedan versions sold in the United States, about 185,500, were built at its Lordstown, Ohio plant. About 4,500 hatchback Cruze versions were assembled in Mexico and sold in the United States.

Xerox&#8217;s sibling business services unit, Conduent, spun off into a separate company on Tuesday. It must now find a way to lift its growth amid stagnant sales and a tough market. Xerox acquired the roots of Conduent, which handles everything from human resources services for healthcare companies to mobile parking apps for the city of Los Angeles, by buying Affiliated Computer Services for nearly $6.4 billion in 2010. The deal was supposed to help Xerox find another source of revenue beyond it&#8217;s core copier and printing business. But like other big business tech companies like IBM and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Xerox&#8217;s overall revenue has declined in recent years. With few people printing and copying, Xerox&#8217;s annual sales have dropped each year since 2011. During much of that time, Xerox&#8217;s business services group struggled. In a nine-month period ending in September, Conduent had $4.9 billion in revenue, or nearly flat compared to the previous year. Xerox&#8217;s executives say that two smaller, more nimble businesses will be able to better adapt to a rapidly changing technology world. The argument echoes that of Hewlett Packard, which split into two companies last year. But Wall Street didn&#8217;t exactly give Conduent a happy birthday. In its first day of trading, the company&#8217;s shares fell 8% to $13.72. In this edited interview with Fortune, Conduent CEO Ashok Vemuri talks about splitting from Xerox xrx , competing with IBM ibm and HPE hpe , and new beginnings. Fortune: Tell me about splitting from Xerox. Vemuri: If you go back six to seven years when Xerox acquired a company called ACS [Affiliated Computer Services] in 2010, the thesis of that acquisition was that Xerox was a hardware manufacturing company. This was during a recession, and management thought the best would be to serve your clients soup-to-nuts, if you will, by acquiring a services company. It was very similar to other companies\u2014think Dell with Perot [$3.9 billion deal was announced in 2009], HP with EDS [$13.9 billion deal was announced in 2008] That construct of combining hardware with services didn\u2019t necessarily pan out. So, it was thought that our two companies would be better served if they were sliced off and were allowed to control their own destiny and serve their own clients, their own market, their own technology, etc. Get Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter. Why did hardware companies think that they also had to have business services? It was the height of the recession. This was considered a sort of natural hedge in terms of buying revenue. Secondly, it was believed that if you sold a piece of equipment to a client, they were servicing that equipment with somebody else. So why would I not, if I sold you that equipment, service it instead? Thirdly, services companies were on the ascendancy. Remember, even 10 years ago, print, paper, ink was on decline, and it continues to be so. The services business is where the margins are\u2014where the cash flow is\u2014and your need for spending is much less. If you look at an equipment provider like Xerox, it\u2019s more a finance operating lease company, because they fund your purchase of a printer. A services business is asset light. It does not require you to invest your balance sheet in a big way. Some analysts believe the downside of a service company, however, are the costs of hiring employees, which can eat into profitability. That\u2019s wrong. That is the conventional way of thinking about services businesses. In our model, 80% of our business is transactions based. We do everything off the back of technology. That allows me to add a multitude of services off a particular platform. Let me give you an example. If I have three or four clients, I cannot repurpose my people because they aren\u2019t fungible. I can\u2019t say, \u201cHey, for two hours you be on the call center, for two hours you do transaction processing, for two hours you work for Client A, and for two hours you work for Client B.\u201d But I can do it if I do it on the back of technology, because my platform aggregates and creates air pockets that allow me to work for multiple clients. I can repurpose my platform to do multiple functions. With people, I can\u2019t expect them to work more than eight hours. What are the services that your company does? We serve two broad segments. One is the public sector. We work with all 50 U.S. states and over 500 government entities worldwide. We do a lot of work in transportation. Think about parking: You use a parking app pay over the phone, and the phone reminds you after 45 minutes to pay more We are now handling road tolls\u2014so think EasyPass in California and SunPass in Florida. We are the world\u2019s largest prepaid card processor. We do things like welfare, Social Security, Food Stamps. The other part of the business is commercial. We work with 74 of the top Fortune 100 companies. We support them on mission-critical systems. Apple aapl co-founder Steve Jobs once publicly criticized Xerox for not capitalizing on its technology. Correct. In a similar way, a lot of Conduent\u2019s technology was invented in Xerox over the last six years. The ACS story is six years old; a little is left, but a lot of that is new and a lot of that was invented in Xerox. Now that you\u2019re an independent company, how do you balance spending on research into new technologies with pleasing investors? Clearly today, technology is at a place where you don\u2019t necessarily have to build components in-house; you can buy them from others. We have to rid ourselves of the sensibility we\u2019ve had that if it\u2019s not invented in-house it\u2019s not worth looking at. We are now a public company, so our research dollars have to give a return in the year that I give the dollar in, unlike in the past in which the time to yield was like five to seven years. Having said that, technology will be the underpinning of every process we bring. Therefore we must invest in our technology platform and make it modern. The speed of technology is changing and the way it is being consumed is dramatically changing in such a short time frame that our investments have to reflect that time horizon as well as the fact that these changes are happening. Who are your biggest competitors? We are in a wide range of industries, so we have a lot of them. A lot of them are very niche and specialized companies. Across our various businesses, we see as competitors like Accenture, we see IBM, we see HPE. My advantage is I\u2019m a pure-play business process provider. I\u2019m the largest in revenue and in size and scale. For more about enterprise technology, watch: How do you distinguish yourselves from the big business services groups of companies like IBM that may brag that their technology separates them from the pack? Technology is a commodity. I can buy technology every other day at half the price I paid the day before yesterday. The technology product isn\u2019t going to give you any differentiation. What gives you differentiation is what you do with that technology. If I understand processes and have functional and domain knowledge, then I can actually leverage that technology and literally make it jump through hoops to provide me the answer or the outcome that the business really needs.","rendered":"\u003Cp\u003EIt&#8217;s a new beginning for Xerox&#8217;s spawn.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EXerox&#8217;s sibling business services unit, Conduent, spun off into a separate company on Tuesday.

This might have seemed like an academic ethical question in the past, but with business mogul Donald Trump set to move into the Oval Office soon, it has become much more pressing, and more than a little contentious. During a weekend interview on Meet the Press that included both New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet and Wall Street Journal editor Gerard Baker, the latter was asked whether he thought inaccurate statements by Trump should be specifically called out as lies. Baker said that he didn&#8217;t think so, because the word &#8220;lie&#8221; implies that the person told an untruth on purpose. Instead, the Journal editor argued that media outlets should simply present the facts and leave it up to readers to determine the truth. The word lie &#8220;implies much more than just saying something that&#8217;s false. It implies a deliberate intent to mislead,&#8221; Baker said. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s up to the reader to make up their own mind&#8230; If you start ascribing a moral intent, as it were, to someone by saying that they&#8217;ve lied, I think you run the risk that you look like you\u2019re not being objective.&#8221; Get Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter. Legendary news anchor Dan Rather, however, took issue with this approach in a post on his Facebook page that was widely shared among journalists. Rather called Baker&#8217;s argument &#8220;deeply disturbing.&#8221; It is not the proper role of journalists, the former anchor said, &#8220;to meet lies \u2014 especially from someone of Mr. Trump\u2019s stature and power \u2014 by hiding behind semantics and euphemisms. Our role is to call it as we see it, based on solid reporting. When something is, in fact, a demonstrable lie, it is our responsibility to say so.&#8221; In his NBC interview, Baker referred to Trump&#8217;s repeated statements that Muslims were seen cheering in New Jersey when the World Trade Center towers fell. The Journal reported that there was no evidence this had actually occurred, Baker said, and then left it to the reader to decide. But even if the standard principle is that something can only be called a lie if we know the intent of the speaker\u2014as the Journal editor argues it should be\u2014can we not assume that Trump was making those statements with a deliberate intent to mislead voters about Muslim behavior? After all, he said it multiple times, even after it had been proven false. The same thing goes for many other Trump statements on a wide range of issues. He has repeatedly said that millions of people voted illegally, which isn&#8217;t true, and that ending the &#8220;stop and frisk&#8221; campaign in New York increased crime, which it didn&#8217;t. There are literally hundreds of such examples. At what point does repeating them stop being a falsehood and become an outright lie? In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally &mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2016 Baker&#8217;s argument is very similar to the one made by moderators like Fox News host Chris Wallace and MSNBC host Chris Matthews during the presidential debates. Wallace said he didn&#8217;t think it was a moderator&#8217;s job to be a &#8220;truth squad,&#8221; while Matthews said calling out lies would be equivalent to expressing an opinion, which journalists shouldn&#8217;t do. Those comments came up in large part because Matt Lauer of NBC was widely criticized for failing to challenge Trump during an interview when the candidate claimed that he never supported the war in Iraq, despite abundant evidence to the contrary. In a Twitter debate on Monday with a number of journalists, including Fusion writer Felix Salmon and former New York Observer editor Elizabeth Spiers, Time Inc.&#8217;s chief content officer Alan Murray (who is also editor of this magazine) defended Baker&#8217;s approach, saying journalists should be careful about using the word &#8220;lie&#8221; without proof that the speaker deliberately intended to mislead. Words matter. &quot;False&quot; and &quot;lie&quot; are not the same thing. https:\u002F\u002Ft.co\u002FACM5exCej2 &mdash; Alan Murray (@alansmurray) January 3, 2017 Spiers and others, however, said journalists make intelligent inferences about a politician&#8217;s motives all the time, and catching one in a lie is no different. Former Fortune writer Dan Primack, who is now with the media startup Axios, said: &#8220;I agree about being careful. But if you can prove the shoe fits, then put it on.&#8221; Washington Post writer Greg Sargent argued that &#8220;Donald Trump lies. A lot. And news organizations should say so.&#8221; These are all of Trump&#8217;s potential conflicts of interest: Inaccurate statements aren&#8217;t always lies. As Murray pointed out, Ronald Reagan said a lot of things that turned out not to be true, but not all of them were lies. But he didn&#8217;t repeatedly tell the same untruths over and over in the face of all the available evidence, the way Trump has done throughout his campaign, behavior he will presumably continue once he is in office. How can a self-respecting journalistic organization not call those lies? In the kind of broken media landscape we currently have, something Trump took advantage of better than anyone else during the campaign, not calling out obvious lies risks providing him with the headlines he wants\u2014apparently reinforcing his questionable claims\u2014with the evidence against his statements buried in the lower parts of a story that no one will read.","rendered":"\u003Cp\u003EWhat should the media do when the U.S. president says something that is clearly and unequivocally not true?

The move has prompted the EU finance ministers to freeze implementation of debt restructuring. Greece is at the brink again. This is the modern-day, Greek economic tragedy. But unlike the three-acts ancient Greek tragedies, we\u2019ve seen many acts and often the horrible events happen on stage. Of the main actors, the Greek government repeatedly threatens with suicide elections; the IMF tries to apply the same rules to all countries irrespective of development level; the EU bureaucrats paint a rosy picture with no grounding in reality or economics, and German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble keeps reading the same austerity rulebook no matter what the circumstances. Even worse, there is practically no dialogue among the actors \u2013 they deliver their monologues past each other, each trying to please a different chorus. How did we get here (again), is there hope, and, more importantly, and how does it end? After two large bailouts in 2010 and 2012 from the EU and the IMF, and after a negotiated haircut of \u20ac100 billion off its bonds, Greece was close to recovery in 2014. It had reversed the 2010 15-plus percent deficit and achieved a small primary surplus (before paying interest), reached growth after four years of recession, and even issued new bonds. However, the fiscal consolidation did not happen through spending cuts but rather through large increases in taxation, resulting in a multi-year recession. With Greeks having lost 25% of their income, and unemployment at 25%, disaffected voters brought to power a tiny, radical left party in early 2015. Following a defiant stance in early 2015, which resulted in closed banks, capital controls, reversal of growth and exclusion from money markets, the present radical left Greek government signed an onerous agreement. The agreement provided Greece a new loan of \u20ac87 billion, yet required that Greece achieve a 3.5% of GDP surplus (through more austerity) for a number of years. This target was clearly not feasible, and the Bank of Greece proposed a surplus of 1.5% to 2% of GDP. The IMF agreed with this target, and has asked the EU to restructure Greek debt obligations consistent with this target as well as for implementation of structural reforms that would make the Greek economy competitive. However, the EU has insisted on the 3.5% surplus target and painted an unrealistically rosy picture of the Greek economy to make this target appear feasible, while not pressing Greece on reforms. Greece\u2019s choice was a no-brainer: side with the IMF, have less austerity, have immediate and deep debt restructuring, and implement reforms that will make Greece more competitive and bring it out of the crisis. Instead, the Greek government sided with the EU, accepted higher austerity and less debt restructuring. Why? The Greek government wants to avoid reforming and shrinking the State because civil servants are its main block of voters. Compounding this error, the Greek government has now violated the fiscal agreement and reverted to the defiant tactics of the first half of 2015. But there\u2019s still hope. The solution to the Greek crisis is obvious and has been obvious for some time: make reforms, cut state expenditure, cut taxes, simplify investment procedures, open markets to competition, and proceed with privatizations. The present Greek government has failed in all of these dimensions. Fortunately, for Greece, a pro-reforms consensus is emerging. All opposition parties with the exception of the Communist and the Nazi party are now pro-reform. Additionally, a reformist politician, Kyriakos Mistotakis, has been elected leader of the main opposition party, center-right New Democracy, which presently has a large lead in polls. He has advocated a strictly reformist agenda. There are two additional factors that make reforms more likely to succeed now. First, the IMF fully supports the reforms and is willing to battle with the Europeans for debt restructuring, less austerity, and more reforms. Second, many Greeks, having tried everything else, now see reforms as the only way out of the crisis. Reforms and fiscal discipline is the only way for Greece to survive and prosper in the European Union. The alternative, Grexit, would plunge Greece to poverty and hyperinflation leading to a crisis a-la-Venezuela in Europe.

Trends Every Business Leader Should Watch in 2017"},"content":{"plain":"As technology and digital marketing tools continue to improve, businesses will have to adapt to trends in marketing and consumer behavior. Businesses that are attentive to the trends and changes of 2017 will be able to quickly implement new tools and strategies for greater success and improved customer interaction. Here are 15 trends and changes in products, marketing, and leadership to keep an eye on in the new year. 1. The Internet of Things In 2016, we found our smart devices to be more efficient and capable than ever. Products like Nest allow us to change the environment in our home remotely through other smart devices. In 2017, we\u2019ll continue to see advancements in sensors, software and technology that will allow our devices to be interconnected and speak to one another. Related: The Biggest News Stories That Got Us Talking In 2016 2. Green products Consumers care about corporations that are socially responsible and sustainable. The younger generation is increasingly likely to buy into companies who follow a TOMS give-back model or feature environmentally friendly products and packaging. Companies are aware that millennials are giving priority to those who are socially-conscious and are adapting their products and values accordingly. 3. Companies that connect Rather than directly selling a product, we\u2019ve seen a rise in companies looking to connect consumers with a service. Airbnb, Uber, and Trunk Club allow millennials to lead an asset-light life. The connections these companies provide help build a sense of community while consumers feel they\u2019re getting a service they need. 4. Personalized products Companies are going out of their way to touch each consumer and make products tailored to the individual. Consumers want a sense of independence and will buy from companies who value their individuality. We see examples of this trend in everything from Nike\u2019s Customizable Sneakers to Tesla allowing consumers to completely build and personalize every detail of their new automobile from scratch.

Virtual and augmented reality In 2016, virtual reality became available to consumers through products like the Oculus and Google Daydream Viewer Headset. In 2017, we\u2019ll continue to see advancements in VR and businesses will benefit in areas such as training, education, and productivity. Augmented reality is built on top of VR, with the most recent example being the Microsoft HoloLens which allows for 3D Holograms. 6. Drone technology Drones have become the must-have toy for hobbyists throughout the world. Businesses are starting to leverage the technology for enhanced customer experiences. One example worth noting is VILLAWAY, a company initiating drone property tours of vacation homes in 2017. The use of drone technology for enhanced consumer education is something we will continue to see in the future. 7. Creating a personal brand New and emerging digital platforms allow businesses and individuals to distinguish themselves from competitors by building a personal brand. This personal brand is how a business will gain individuality when marketing themselves to an audience. Social media tools such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube allow audiences to feel connected to businesses while learning about the brand values and vision. 8. Artificial intelligence In 2017, we\u2019ll see the rise of machines that can learn and complete tasks that would normally require human intelligence. We\u2019ve already caught a glimpse of machines that can problem-solve on their own, like self-driving cars. In the next year, we\u2019ll be exposed to more machines that can adapt and learn skills only we as humans have possessed thus far. You can already even request a fully autonomous Uber. 9. Remote employees As the digital space allows employees to complete work assignments from just about anywhere, more employees are seeking a flexible schedule and the comfort of working from home. Remote employees allow an employer to have access to talent all over the world. Communication tools such as Google Hangouts, FaceTime, and Skype allow employers to have face-to-face meetings with employees who are not physically present. 10. E-commerce The ease and convenience of online shopping is something consumers value, especially with perks like free same-day shipping from Amazon Prime. Social media marketing and Google Adwords make it easy for e-commerce companies to reach their target audience and ensure their ads are being seen by the eyes that matter most. 11. Fitness wearables Consumers are gravitating toward fitness wearables as new technology allows us to track what we eat, how far we walk, and what kinds of exercises we do throughout the day. Fitbit and the Nike Running App provide a competitive and gamified way for consumers to stay active and healthy. We\u2019ll likely see the release of wearables with even more intuitive software in 2017. 12. Big Data and analytics We\u2019ve seen a struggle this last year with businesses gathering misleading data. In 2017, we\u2019ll continue to see even more accurate measurements and customer data. With Facebook continually upgrading and improving analytics, companies will be able to gather even more information about consumers to inform marketing decisions. 13. Video content We\u2019ll see even more brands begin to utilize video content as VR and augmented reality become more mainstream. With the ability to share video content easily on social media through platforms like Snapchat or Facebook Live, brands are looking for new, innovative ways to capture an audience\u2019s attention through video. 14. Social media marketing Social media has become a crucial addition to every brand\u2019s marketing strategy. Platforms such as Instagram and Facebook will continue to improve ads and analytics, making it easier for brands to reach their target consumers. Social media will continue to be an important way for brands to maintain relationships and build a community of loyal customers. 15. Chatbots We\u2019ll continue to see intelligent chatbots like Siri and Alexa who can perform simple tasks and pull information. As the software improves, we\u2019ll see artificial intelligence and human characteristics used to improve the quality of information provided. We may also see chatbots that are able to learn a user\u2019s preferences and utilize those preferences when providing information. Machines will keep getting smarter and new technology will increase productivity among businesses. Remote workers and virtual tours will allow businesses to connect with consumers and employees all over the world. \u2013 Chirag Kulkarni is the co-founder of Taco and Insightfully","rendered":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EAs technology and digital marketing tools continue to improve, businesses will have to adapt to trends in marketing and consumer behavior.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EBusinesses that are attentive to the trends and changes of 2017 will be able to quickly implement new tools and strategies for greater success and improved customer interaction.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003EHere are 15 trends and changes in products, marketing, and leadership t\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003Eo keep an eye on in the new year.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1.

2017 Will See Desperate Department Stores and Anxious Apparel Chains"},"content":{"plain":"It was a hard year for many retailers. Amazon.com amzn continued to run away with the e-commerce prize, and consumers, though in much better shape financially than they have been in many years, are getting increasingly bargain-hungry. The result has been declining sales at many major retailers (particularly department stores) and store closings by the hundreds. But a new year offers the industry a clean slate, whether it be a new CEO or new initiatives to break that sales skid. Indeed, 2017 will be a decisive year for many retailers, as investors will feel many have had enough time to show they can figure out a way to update how they do business in the e-commerce era. Target tgt and Kohl&#8217;s kss in particular are under pressure to show their turnarounds are still on track. Meanwhile Walmart wmt can&#8217;t let up for a second if it hopes to begin to narrow the e-commerce gap with Amazon. Department stores up and down the price spectrum are under growing pressure to show they can still be relevant and central to the shopping experience. And apparel chains have been talking for about two years about how they plan to address fast fashion and increase the quality of their products agin. 2017 promises to be a decisive year in which retailers plow ahead in the internet era and which get left behind, possibly for good. Here are the top 10 stories in Fortune will follow most closely in 2017. 1) What Will Macy&#8217;s New CEO Change? Macy&#8217;s m announced in June its long time CEO Terry Lundgren would be stepping down in 2017 and be replaced by veteran Macy&#8217;s executive Jeff Gennette. Though well regarded, he&#8217;ll have to prove that a 33-year company veteran will be up to the task of renewing the department store chain with fresh ideas at a time people are buying their clothes and beauty products elsewhere. Macy&#8217;s has been closing dozens of stores and doing everything from beefing up its wedding business to adding Apple aapl boutiques, and yet the sales declines go on. 2) Will Gap Inc Snap Its Losing Streak? The owner of Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic has reported seven straight quarters of comparable sales declines and the turnaround CEO Art Peck has been promising has been slow in coming. He is trying to make the apparel giant more nimble and better able to react to trends and increase the quality of clothes at a time consumer see apparel as a commodity. The company has managed to cut costs, and Old Navy, its biggest brand seems to be back on track, but Peck has now been in the corner office for almost two years, so any continuation of Gap Inc&#8217;s problems in 2017 will be on him. 3) Will Barnes &amp; Noble Find a CEO Who&#8217;ll Stay? Barnes &amp; Noble stunned the retail world this summer when it fired CEO Ron Boir after barely more than year, pronouncing the former Sears Canada CEO a &#8220;poor fit&#8221; with the bookseller, and dealing with its third chief executive exit in three year. So the retailer turned to founder and top shareholder Len Riggio to steer the ship while it looks yet again for a new boss. Barnes &amp; Noble got a bit of a break from the plateauing of e-books, but its online sales are in decline and its stores in need of an update. The retailer needs to show there is a room for it between Amazon.com and the resurgence of independent bookstores. 4) What Will Happen Next With Target&#8217;s Food Business? One of Target tgt CEO Brian Cornell&#8217;s big plans when he started two years ago was to fix the discounter&#8217;s food business and give it a more defined raison d&#8217;tre. But in 2016, the executive he brought in to fix the grocery business left and Cornell himself said Target had no intention of becoming a full service grocer. So that leaves unanswered questions about Target&#8217;s food strategy. Grocery is a key driver of shopper traffic and with Walmart aggressively upgrading its food areas, Target stands to lose a lot of its overall business while it figures this out. 5) Will Jet.com Send Walmart&#8217;s Online Sales Through the Roof? Walmart surprised many this summer when it shelled out $3 billion to buy Jet.com in the hopes of rejuvenating and re-igniting its online business. The retailer has added millions of items to its online assortment thanks to its marketplace overhaul and online sales growth is on the upswing again. At the same time, it remains to be seen how Jet.com itself can help Walmart&#8217;s namesake website and there is the chance for cultural clashes between the two as they integrate. 6) Will Sears Make It Through the Year? Well it should, despite itself. Sears Holdings shld has already shown us for the past decade how a retailer can hang on for a loooong time despite sharply declining sales year in, year out. But lately, Sears sales declines are getting worse and it is running out of things to sell off to maintain a cash cushion. And a new threat has emerged: J.C. Penney jcp has resumed selling appliances for the first time since 1983, taking aim at one of Sears&#8217; biggest businesses. CEO Eddie Lampert&#8217;s promised turnaround still hasn&#8217;t materialized, in fact its problems are worsening. And he&#8217;ll be able to kick the can down the road for only so much longer. 7) Can Whole Foods&#8217; New 365 Chain Win It New Shoppers? Whole Foods Market wfm opened its first low price &#8220;365&#8221; grocery stores this year and plans to ramp that up significantly with 10 more in 2017, a much bigger test for a chain meant to win the grocer derided by some as &#8220;Whole Paycheck&#8221; for its high prices more millennial shoppers. But Whole Foods will be going up against a Walmart that has spent a fortune upgrading its grocery aisles and added many fancier items. At the same time, with business slowing at its main grocery chain, Whole Foods needs 365 to be a home run. 8) Here Come More Germans! The ramped up expansion of German discount grocer Aldi in the last few years has put a ton of pressure on the likes of Walmart and Kroger kr in the competition for lower income consumers with its inexpensive, no frills stores and popular private brands. But in 2017, a brand new German rival is hitting U.S. shores: Lidl is planning to open 150 stores, with more to come later. The growing ubiquity of small format, low cost food stores threatens to upend the U.S. grocery industry and force Walmart, Whole Foods et al to really raise their game. 9) Will Luxury Department Stores Get Back on Track? Upscale retailers Neiman Marcus, Macy&#8217;s m Bloomingdale&#8217;s, Nordstrom and HBC&#8217;s hbc Saks Fifth Avenue have all had trouble this year getting people to come to their department stores. (Their outlet chains are doing fine.) Shoppers no longer want to wait nine months from when they see something at a runway to show to when they can buy it. And the internet has made it easier to comparison-shop turning even luxury items into commodities. So these chains are all investing in upgrading their stores, focusing on getting more exclusive product to win back some pricing power and seeking to quicken the product cycle to react more quickly to how younger luxe shoppers buy, rather than their older mainstay customers. 10) Can J.C. Penney Continue to Outperform Rivals? Penney has worn the Comeback Kid moniker for a couple of years now, regularly outperforming Kohl&#8217;s and Macy&#8217;s, among others in sales growth. And under CEO Marvin Ellison, the retailer has shifted the focus away from apparel, boosted its private label brands, returned to appliance sales and updated its woefully inadequate e-commerce. So far that has worked. But Penney&#8217;s comparable sales declined in the third quarter of 2016 and it has cut the long hanging fruit in its cost reductions. With Macy&#8217;s and Sears closing dozens of stores each, many malls they co-anchor with Penney will lose traffic, something that will hurt Penney. Ellison is betting the market share he will win from those rivals will more than offset sales lost to shoppers who are going AWOL at the mall.","rendered":"\u003Cp\u003EIt was a hard year for many retailers. \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ffortune.com\u002Ffortune500\u002Famazoncom-18\u002F\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EAmazon.com\u003C\u002Fa\u003E \u003Cspan class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"amzn\"\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\u003Cspan class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\"\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003Ca class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ffortune.com\u002Ffortune500\u002Famazon-com-18\u002F\"\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003Cspan class=\"ticker\"\u003Eamzn\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003Cspan class=\"change percent\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\n\t\t\t\t\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\n\t\t\t\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ffortune.com\u002F2016\u002F12\u002F02\u002Famazon-cyber-monday-2\u002F\"\u003Econtinued to run away with the e-commerce prize\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, and consumers, though in much better shape financially than they have been in many years, are getting increasingly bargain-hungry.

Just this year, GDP per capita for the Eurozone as a whole finally returned to pre-crisis levels. It is claiming victory in Spain\u2014even though unemployment remains near 20% and youth unemployment is more than twice that\u2014simply because things are better today than they have been since the euro crisis began a half decade ago. Greece remains in a severe depression. Growth for the Eurozone over the past year has been an anemic 1.6%, and that number is twice the average growth rate from 2005 to 2015. Historians are already speaking of the Eurozone\u2019s lost decade, and it\u2019s possible they\u2019ll soon be writing about its last decade, too. The euro was introduced in 2002, but the cracks in the single currency arrangement, which began in 1999, became evident with the 2008 global financial crisis. Economists had predicted that the test of the euro would occur when the region faced a shock, and Europe was unlucky in facing such a big shock coming from across the Atlantic so soon after its creation. By 2010, the euro crisis had become full blown, with interest rates on the sovereign debt of the \u201cperiphery\u201d\u2014Greece, Spain, Ireland, and Portugal\u2014soaring to unheard-of levels. But a closer look at the Eurozone shows imbalances building up from the very beginning\u2014with money rushing into the periphery countries in the misguided belief that eliminating exchange rate risk had somehow eliminated all risk. This illustrates one of the key flaws in the construction of the Eurozone: It was based on the belief that if only government didn\u2019t mess things up\u2014if it kept deficits below 3% of GDP, debt below 60% of GDP, and inflation below 2% per annum\u2014the market would ensure growth and stability. Those numbers, and the underlying ideas, had no basis in either theory or evidence. Ireland and Spain, two of the worst afflicted countries, actually had surpluses before the crisis. The crisis caused their deficits and debt, not the other way around. The hope was that fiscal and monetary discipline would result in convergence, enabling the single-currency system to work even better. Instead, there has been divergence, with the rich countries getting richer and the poor getting poorer, and within countries, the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer. But it was the very structure of the Eurozone that predictably led to this. The single market, for instance, made it easy for money to leave the banks of the weaker countries, forcing these banks to contract lending, weakening the weak further. Economists assessing the prospects of a single currency arrangement some quarter century ago emphasized the importance of sufficient labor mobility and an adequately large common budget to buffer against shocks as well as sufficient economic similarity among the countries. But the euro took away two of the critical instruments for adjustment\u2014the exchange and interest rates\u2014and didn\u2019t put anything in their place. There was no common deposit insurance, no common way of resolving problems in the banking sector, and no common unemployment insurance scheme. Equally important, these early discussions ignored the importance of intellectual convergence: There is a huge gap in perceptions of what makes for good policies, especially between Germany and much of the rest of Europe. These differences are longstanding. They were evident to me when I chaired the Economic Policy Committee of the OECD in the mid-1990s. If anything, there has been divergence here, too. Thus, the austerity policy\u2014which Germany thought should have brought a quick return to growth\u2014has failed miserably in virtually every country in which it has been tried. The consequences were predictable, and predicted by most serious economists around the world. So too, many of the particular structural reforms have actually weakened the countries on which they have been imposed, lowering growth and increasing their trade deficits. A huge democratic deficit has since opened up: citizens in Greece, Spain, and Portugal have all voted in large numbers for parties opposed to austerity. Yet, they have felt they have no choice but to accept the demands of Germany. Citizens were never told that when they joined the euro, they would be giving up their economic sovereignty. The ambition of the euro was to bring greater prosperity to Europe. This, in turn, would promote economic and political integration. The euro was a political project, but the politics weren\u2019t strong enough to create the institutional arrangements that would ensure success. With the euro leading to stagnation and worse, it is no surprise that it has led to increasing divisiveness rather than to more solidarity. Today, it seems that the euro, which was supposed to be a means to an end, has become an end in itself\u2014the pursuit of which poses perhaps the single most important threat to the European project. In response to the repeated crises, Europe has made reforms, but they have been too little, too late. Some may actually be counterproductive: Having a system of common supervision, without adequate sensitivity to local macro-conditions and without common deposit insurance may actually exacerbate divergence. Meanwhile, the region has the misfortune of being repeatedly bombarded with crises, especially the refugee crisis. With unemployment in so many countries so high\u2014at least partly because of the euro\u2014those seeking a new future wish to move to where there are jobs, resulting in a few countries bearing the brunt of the wave of migrants. And naturally, countries where unemployment is high resist having new workers competing for the scarce jobs. Europe has been engaged in brinkmanship, but the danger of brinkmanship is that there is a high probability that eventually one goes over the brink. Markets sense that the system is not viable in the long run\u2014speculators attack when they smell blood. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi\u2019s assertion that he will do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d has worked wonders\u2014for longer than anyone expected. But it is a confidence trick: It works only because market participants believe it will work. These market forces are intertwined with politics. Voters who should be unhappy\u2014simply because they have done so poorly for such a long time\u2014have expressed their anger by voting against the centrist parties of the left and right. The dissidents are in the ascendancy. &nbsp; Perhaps European leaders, sensing the urgency of the moment, will finally make the reforms in the structure of the Eurozone that will enable a single currency arrangement to work\u2014to achieve a shared prosperity. Perhaps 2017 will be the year in which the reform of the Eurozone really takes hold. In order for a single currency system to work, there has to be more Europe\u2014more solidarity; more willingness of the stronger countries to help the weaker; more willingness to create institutions like a common deposit insurance and a common unemployment scheme\u2014than the current halfway house, which is simply not viable. But the failures of the Eurozone make such reforms increasingly hard. It is at least as likely that the political forces are going in the other direction, and if that is the case, it may be only a matter of time before Europe looks back on the euro as an interesting, well-intentioned experiment that failed\u2014at great cost to the citizens of Europe and their democracies.

But a closer look at the Eurozone shows imbalances building up from the very beginning\u2014with money rushing into the periphery countries in the misguided belief that eliminating exchange rate risk had somehow eliminated all risk.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis illustrates one of the key flaws in the construction of the Eurozone: It was based on the belief that if only government didn\u2019t mess things up\u2014if it kept deficits below 3% of GDP, debt below 60% of GDP, and inflation below 2% per annum\u2014the market would ensure growth and stability. Those numbers, and the underlying ideas, had no basis in either theory or evidence. Ireland and Spain, two of the worst afflicted countries, actually had surpluses before the crisis. The crisis caused their deficits and debt, not the other way around.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe hope was that fiscal and monetary discipline would result in \u003Cem\u003Econvergence, \u003C\u002Fem\u003Eenabling the single-currency system to work even better. Instead, there has been divergence, with the rich countries getting richer and the poor getting poorer, and within countries, the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer. But it was the very structure of the Eurozone that predictably led to this. The single market, for instance, made it easy for money to leave the banks of the weaker countries, forcing these banks to contract lending, weakening the weak further.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEconomists assessing the prospects of a single currency arrangement some quarter century ago emphasized the importance of sufficient labor mobility and an adequately large common budget to buffer against shocks as well as sufficient \u003Cem\u003Eeconomic \u003C\u002Fem\u003Esimilarity among the countries. But the euro took away two of the critical instruments for adjustment\u2014the exchange and interest rates\u2014and didn\u2019t put anything in their place. There was no common deposit insurance, no common way of resolving problems in the banking sector, and no common unemployment insurance scheme.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEqually important, these early discussions ignored the importance of \u003Cem\u003Eintellectual \u003C\u002Fem\u003Econvergence: There is a huge gap in perceptions of what makes for good policies, especially between Germany and much of the rest of Europe. These differences are longstanding. They were evident to me when I chaired the Economic Policy Committee of the OECD in the mid-1990s. If anything, there has been divergence here, too. Thus, the austerity policy\u2014which Germany thought should have brought a quick return to growth\u2014has failed miserably in virtually every country in which it has been tried. The consequences were predictable, and predicted by most serious economists around the world. So too, many of the particular structural reforms have actually weakened the countries on which they have been imposed, lowering growth and increasing their trade deficits.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"p1\"\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"s1\"\u003EA huge democratic deficit has since opened up: citizens in Greece, Spain, and Portugal have all voted in large numbers for parties opposed to austerity. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003EYet, they have felt they have no choice but to accept the demands of Germany.

This, in turn, would promote economic and political integration. The euro was a political project, but the politics weren\u2019t strong enough to create the institutional arrangements that would ensure success. With the euro leading to stagnation and worse, it is no surprise that it has led to increasing divisiveness rather than to more solidarity. Today, it seems that the euro, which was supposed to be a means to an end, has become an end in itself\u2014the pursuit of which poses perhaps the single most important threat to the European project.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn response to the repeated crises, Europe has made reforms, but they have been too little, too late. Some may actually be counterproductive: Having a system of common supervision, without adequate sensitivity to local macro-conditions and without common deposit insurance may actually exacerbate divergence. Meanwhile, the region has the misfortune of being repeatedly bombarded with crises, especially the refugee crisis. With unemployment in so many countries so high\u2014at least partly because of the euro\u2014those seeking a new future wish to move to where there are jobs, resulting in a few countries bearing the brunt of the wave of migrants. And naturally, countries where unemployment is high resist having new workers competing for the scarce jobs.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEurope has been engaged in brinkmanship, but the danger of brinkmanship is that there is a high probability that eventually one goes over the brink.

By his own admission, Duterte says he is no expert on the economy and leaves it to &#8220;the bright guys&#8221; in his cabinet. Economic Planning Secretary Ernesto Pernia sees the president only twice monthly and rarely hears feedback. He said Duterte was focused almost entirely on crime and drugs. &#8220;That has been his obsession,&#8221; he told Reuters. &#8220;He essentially leaves other issues and concerns to the cabinet.&#8221; The strategy seems to have worked so far although economists are beginning to question how long it can last. &#8220;That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re hoping for, that his core economic team can prevail,&#8221; said Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI) economist Emilio S. Neri. &#8220;The fundamentals are there but we are leaning towards deficit spending and stimulus-driven growth and some unsustainable populist policies are worrisome.&#8221; At the national level, Duterte&#8217;s signature campaigns have included his tilt toward China while turning his back on long-term ally the United States in addition to the war on drugs. He rarely mentions it, but the economy has boomed under his watch, although some of the gains have been ascribed to the previous administration&#8217;s policies and Duterte&#8217;s decision to retain them. Growth reached an annual 7.1% in the third quarter of the year, Asia&#8217;s second-highest and the country&#8217;s strongest quarter in three years. The government expects full-year growth around 7%. The economy is expected to grow 6.5-7.5% in 2017, but there are worries that Duterte&#8217;s erratic behavior could impact policy, with political risk over his drugs crackdown and foul-mouthed outbursts at some big donors and investors. Markets have signaled their concern. In the six months since Duterte took over, the main stock index has lost nearly 20% in dollar terms and is among the worst performers in Asia. Over the same period, the peso currency is down around 5% to the dollar, but other currencies in the region are also depressed. DECISIVE LEADERSHIP But Duterte has plenty of supporters, who say his decisive leadership and intolerance of bad governance will be a long-term boon for the economy. In Davao City, he helped lure investors, dramatically cut red tape and fired inept officials. In 2014, Davao saw growth of a 9.3%, compared to 6.1% nationwide. Analaysts at Nomura have said his populist, development-centered approach suggests he is &#8220;strongly motivated&#8221; to address the Philippines&#8217; biggest weakness &#8211; infrastructure. Expenditure on infrastructure, including on flood management schemes, ports, a rapid-transit bus system and a rail line, makes up a quarter of next year&#8217;s record $67 billion budget. Consumer spending is strong, helped by $22 billion of remittances in the first 10 months from Filipinos overseas, a 4% rise. Unemployment was a record low 4.7% in the third quarter, from 5.7% a year earlier. &#8220;He should deserve credit,&#8221; Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez told Reuters. &#8220;Unfortunately, people are always looking at the controversial statements. But if you judge it, he has done an excellent job &#8230;the important thing is the trust and confidence of businesses in him is very high.&#8221; JITTERS Duterte&#8217;s volatility and seemingly unilateral foreign policy has caused jitters and confusion, especially when he turned hostile towards the United States and then started cosying up to China, with which the Philippines has a history of mistrust over the South China Sea. Duterte announced his &#8220;separation&#8221; from the United States in Beijing in October, shocking even his own ministers, who scrambled to assure investors &#8211; without his consent &#8211; that his policy was to diversify, not sever ties. It&#8217;s a gambit that could pay off, with an intractable dispute with Beijing now on the back burner and China pledging to provide the Philippines with billions of dollars in infrastructure loans and ramp up farm and fisheries imports. Nevertheless, economists warn that hot-headedness and willingness to take big risks could be a problem if it spills into policymaking, especially if it impacts U.S. firms, which account for three-quarters of the country&#8217;s $23 billion business-processing outsourcing (BPO) sector. Some big U.S. firms have delayed BPO investments to undergo more due diligence. Capital Economics notes a &#8220;growing risk that Duterte makes it harder&#8221; to attract big investment. Moody&#8217;s has a stable outlook, expecting &#8220;continued economic outperformance relative to peers,&#8221; assuming Duterte&#8217;s drugs war doesn&#8217;t distract him from his economic reforms. &#8220;There&#8217;s lots of focus going into the anti-drugs program,&#8221; said BPI&#8217;s Neri. &#8220;In six months, economic policy reforms seem to have taken a back seat.&#8221;","rendered":"\u003Cp\u003EAfter six months at the helm in the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte has been touting just two achievements of his presidency &#8211; a vicious war on drugs and a surprise alliance with his country&#8217;s bitter rival, China.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYet behind the curse-laden bluster and populist demagoguery that has defined Duterte&#8217;s rule, he presides over one of the world&#8217;s fastest-growing economies, and has put cabinet colleagues to work on drafting reforms and legislation to tackle the economy&#8217;s most stubborn structural problems.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAdvisers say Duterte&#8217;s economic successes come from using a strategy he honed as the long-time mayor of Davao City at a national level.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHe concentrates on busting crime and deliberately delegates the handling of the economy to others.

The e-commerce giant has been awarded a patent that describes a logistics technology it calls &#8220;airborne fulfillment center (AFC).&#8221; The AFC is essentially in airship that&#8217;s capable of flying at altitudes of 45,000 feet or more that would house items the company sells through its online marketplace. In the patent, Amazon describes a method by which drones would fly into the warehouse, pick up the items they need to deliver, and then deliver those items to the customer&#8217;s home. Amazon AMZN filed for the patent in 2014. While it was actually awarded in April, it wasn&#8217;t discovered until Wednesday by CB Insights tech analyst Zoe Leavitt. Over the last few years, Amazon has been working on drone technology through its Prime Air initiative with an aim on delivering products to customer homes without relying upon logistics companies to do it. Earlier this month, Amazon successfully completed its first drone delivery in the U.K. The company plans to expand its drone testing in 2017 in hopes of eventually relying on the unmanned aerial vehicles to deliver lightweight packages to homes. Get Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter Currently, Amazon&#8217;s drone-delivery process requires the company to erect a warehouse to serve a particular area. Inside that warehouse is a selection of lightweight products the company sells through its e-marketplace. Once a customer places an order, those items are packaged in a box the drone can carry. The drone is then outfitted with the package and delivers it to a customer&#8217;s home within 30 minutes. The potential pitfall with drones, however, is that they can only travel so far, so Amazon would technically need to erect a large number of warehouses around the world just to accommodate customers in disparate areas. But rather than look to the ground for fulfillment centers, Amazon is apparently looking to the sky. Like their grounded alternatives, the AFCs would be home to an inventory of items Amazon sells through its online marketplace, according to the patent. New items would be added to the AFC with help from a logistics shuttle that would carry products to and from the device. When an order is placed, a drone would be outfitted with the desired products and descend from the airship. It would then deliver the items to the customer. Since the drones that Amazon is testing can&#8217;t get up to heights as high as 45,000 feet, the company says its used drones will fly back to a ground installation, where they&#8217;ll be placed in a shuttle and brought back to the AFC. Amazon says the AFC concept could be a boon for handling its logistics, and pointed to its ability to move around in anticipation of demand as one of its benefits. &#8220;The use of an AFC and shuttles also provides another benefit in that the AFC can remain airborne for extended periods of time,&#8221; the company wrote in its patent description. &#8220;In addition, because the AFC is airborne, it is not limited to a fixed location like a traditional ground based materials handling facility. In contrast, it can navigate to different areas depending on a variety of factors, such as weather, expected demand, and\u002For actual demand.&#8221; For its part, Amazon hasn&#8217;t commented on the patent and did not immediately respond to a Fortune request for comment. And like other companies, Amazon often files for patents on technologies it might never bring to the market. But it&#8217;s possible that one day, Amazon drones\u2014and airships\u2014will be flying above, delivering products to folks around the globe.","rendered":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ffortune.com\u002Ffortune500\u002Famazoncom-18\u002F\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EAmazon\u003C\u002Fa\u003E might soon take flight in more ways than one.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe e-commerce giant has been awarded a \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Fpatft1.uspto.gov\u002Fnetacgi\u002Fnph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=9305280.PN.&amp;OS=PN\u002F9305280&amp;RS=PN\u002F9305280\"\u003Epatent\u003C\u002Fa\u003E that describes a logistics technology it calls &#8220;airborne fulfillment center (AFC).&#8221; The AFC is essentially in airship that&#8217;s capable of flying at altitudes of 45,000 feet or more that would house items the company sells through its online marketplace.

Her dress is just long enough to obscure her feet, so she appears to be floating across the baseline. As she strikes the ball, she tips her chin skyward and laughs in slow motion. Meanwhile, I\u2019m perched in the lotus position atop a manta ray that\u2019s hovering above the ground like some kind of Landspeeder. And I\u2019m panicking. How can I keep my balance and still hit the ball\u2014especially with my shirt collar pulling at my neck the way it is? Can\u2019t swing my racket. I jerk my head left. Then right. I claw at my jawline. The ball has cleared the net, and it\u2019s headed my way. If only. I could. Just. Move. My head. And poof. She\u2019s gone. I open my eyes in a strange room. It\u2019s pitch dark and completely silent, but I manage to find my bearings. Santa Cruz, Calif. Breathing heavily, I carefully disentangle a gaggle of wires twisted around my neck and roll over to glance at the clock. Just after 3 a.m. This scene, I now know, was merely one of 18 REM-sleep interruptions that I experienced between 11:18 p.m. and 6:16 a.m. during one long February night. What a strange setting for the only dream I\u2019ve ever had about a chief executive: in a laboratory, tethered to a byzantine apparatus designed to monitor my brain activity as well as every breath, eye movement, muscle twitch, and heartbeat. Let me explain. Like you and probably everyone you know, I\u2019ve always been confounded by my sleep routine. Why do I one morning rise ready to tackle the day and the next seem barely able to lift my head? How much rest can I be getting if I wake up sideways with the covers on the floor and my wife in the guest room? Most important, what can I do better? I don\u2019t want a magic pill. I\u2019ve tried those. I know the rules of thumb: less stress, more exercise, better diet, no afternoon caffeine, put down the damn phone. But I\u2019d kill for a personalized formula. So I subjected myself to a polysomnography test, or PSG, hoping to unravel some of the mysteries of the night. My procedure was administered in the offices of Fullpower Technologies, one floor down from where I had spent most of the evening talking with the company\u2019s founder and CEO, Philippe Kahn. A French expatriate who grew up in Paris, Kahn, 63, is a Silicon Valley oracle whose track record predates the web. He founded Borland Software (acquired by Micro Focus) MCFUF in the mid-1980s, followed by Starfish software (Motorola) and LightSurf Technologies (VeriSign) VRSN . In 1997, while anticipating the birth of his daughter, he paired a state-of-the-art Casio CSIOY camera with a Motorola Startac and became, he claims, the first person to transmit a digital photo over cellular airwaves. He\u2019s also been a leader in wearable technologies. Philippe Kahn says Fullpower is \u201coperating a huge sleep experiment unlike anything anyone has ever done.\u201dPhotograph by Ian Allen for Fortune That\u2019s precisely the focus of Fullpower, which licenses its software to other companies. Nearly five dozen framed patents for wearable-related software and devices hang on the wall in the company\u2019s lobby. The oldest dates to 2005, long before tracking steps became such a phenomenon. In the conference room there\u2019s an assembly of chairs and tables around a full-size bed, making obvious Kahn\u2019s latest obsession. Fullpower built the lab about a decade ago to capture data from sleep patterns. Of course, test subjects don\u2019t typically snooze deeply with wires glued to their skulls, chests, legs, and arms. But almost everyone manages to at least nod off for a while, and the data that subjects generate are valuable and often surprising. \u201cWhat we found early on is that sometimes you sleep less and feel more refreshed,\u201d Kahn says. \u201cIt\u2019s because you woke up in the light part of the sleep cycle.\u201d The insight led him to develop a sleep-cycle alarm that could determine the best time to alert a person within a certain window. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s better to get up at 10 of seven than at seven,\u201d he says. Kahn insists that he\u2019s on the cusp of many more such discoveries, and he\u2019s intent on dispelling some of the conventional wisdom that stresses people out. \u201cPeople say that if you can\u2019t sleep for eight hours without waking up, something\u2019s wrong with you. That\u2019s such a fallacy,\u201d he says. \u201cBefore electricity, people used to sleep in two shifts. That\u2019s how I behave. Sleep for four hours, get up and do an hour and a half of work, and then another four.\u201d He\u2019s also skeptical of the notion that a quiet room is the best environment for shut-eye and dismisses the perceived deleterious effects of repeated rousing. \u201cThe sign of good sleep hygiene may not be how many times you wake up, but rather how rapidly you fall back to sleep. Sleep should be like hunger. Eat only when you\u2019re hungry and until you\u2019re satisfied.\u201d Fullpower has oceans of data to back Kahn\u2019s theories. The company provides the sleep-tracking and activity-monitoring software for the Jawbone UP and Nike Fuel NKE wearable devices as well as a new line of Swiss-made smartwatches and the forthcoming Simmons Sleeptracker Smartbed. The products transmit a mother lode of information (with users\u2019 consent) to Kahn\u2019s team. He thinks that by combining qualitative lab data and quantitative real-world data with machine learning, artificial intelligence, and other analytics technologies, he can unlock the secrets that so many of us walking dead are looking for: a better night\u2019s sleep. \u201cWe\u2019re operating a huge sleep experiment, worldwide, unlike anything anyone has ever done,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have 250 million nights of sleep in our database, and we\u2019re using all the latest technologies to make sense of it.\u201d Kahn is not alone. He\u2019s part of a movement of brilliant entrepreneurs, data scientists, engineers, and academics who are looking at demographics, geographies, and lifestyles, and even into our genomes. They\u2019re the beneficiaries of a historic explosion in sleep data, and they\u2019re using many of the same technologies that are busily decoding some of the world\u2019s other great mysteries. Tiny sensors, big data, analytics, and cloud computing can predict machine breakage, pinpoint power outages, and build better supply chains. Why not put them to work to optimize the most valuable complex system of all, the human body? It\u2019s not an exaggeration to say lack of sleep is killing us. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls it a public health epidemic and estimates that as many as 70 million Americans have a sleep disorder. Sleep deprivation has been linked to clinical depression, obesity, Type 2 diabetes, and cancer. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that drowsy driving causes 1,550 deaths and 40,000 injuries annually in the U.S.\u2009 There are 84 sleep disorders, and some 100 million people\u201480% of them undiagnosed\u2014suffer from one of them in particular: Obstructive sleep apnea, generally indicated by snoring, costs the U.S. economy as much as $165 billion a year, according to a Harvard Medical School study. That\u2019s more than asthma, heart failure, stroke, hypertension, or drunk driving. And the study doesn\u2019t account for tangential effects, like loss of intimacy and divorce. BCC Research predicts that the global market for sleep-aid products\u2014everything from specialty mattresses and high-tech pillows to drugs and at-home tests\u2014will hit $76.7 billion by 2019. The financial upside for anyone who can crack the sleep code is obvious. And so the race is on. \u201cI believe that 15 years from now, if we do this right, we can actually tackle epidemics like obesity, diabetes, and high blood pressure, and any number of lifestyle diseases,\u201d says Kahn. \u201cWe\u2019re going to help people live longer and better lives.\u201d In 1934 this magazine ran a sprawling cover story under the simple headline \u201cSleep.\u201d Published about three decades after the dawn of sleep research, it explored a litany of the day\u2019s devices, concoctions, drugs, and homespun remedies designed, or at least purported, to help insomniacs. The article chronicled the merits of everything from Ovaltine to morphine and Barbital, a synthetic hypnotic that was used as a sleep aid until the mid-1950s despite being habit-forming and occasionally deadly. The story also unpacked the relationship between Zalmon G. Simmons and Harry M. Johnson. Simmons was the president of the eponymous company his father founded, which has by now sold nearly 100 million mattresses, most notably under the Beautyrest brand. Johnson was a psychology professor at Ohio State who was conducting sleep research on the side. At the time, old Zalmon was looking to solve two problems: He needed to sell more mattresses. And he needed sleep. The head of the iconic mattress maker was an insomniac! So he gave Johnson $25,000 to set up a sleep lab at the university now known as Carnegie Mellon. At the time it was believed that normal sleepers lay motionless throughout the night. Johnson collected 2.5 million data points from 160 subjects and demonstrated the folly of that theory. Normal sleepers, he determined, change positions from 20 to 85 times a night, with 35 being a sort of sweet spot. When we toss and turn more, we wake up groggy; any less, and we\u2019re stiff and sore. (The insight would pay dividends for Simmons, the company. Spurred by the revelation that proper sleep required movement, it became the first to introduce king and queen-size mattresses. Unfortunately, Zalmon didn\u2019t solve his personal problem. His insomnia devolved into depression and, in the words of the article, his \u201cfortune began to wobble. Soon after that, sleep ceased to be a problem. For Zalmon G. Simmons was dead.\u201d) Those movements are what enable today\u2019s wearable devices to monitor sleep. Gartner Group IT projects sales of 36 million smart wristbands, a category that includes most Fitbit FIT devices, Jawbone UP, and Nike Fuel, in 2015 and 2016. Fitbit is definitely king. NPD Group estimates that it has an 85% market share. Fitbit raised $732 million in a highly anticipated IPO stoked by the impressive metrics revealed in its S-1 filing: nearly $132 million in net income on $745 million in revenue last year, with $336 million in revenue in the first quarter of this year. Fitbit has sold more than 21 million devices since 2008 and has 9.5 million active users. That means Fitbit is gathering far more data in one night than Johnson did in his career. Thanks to its sleep-monitoring technology, the company can distinguish among variations in movements and has determined that the majority of its users actually wake up between three and 17 times a night\u20149.3 times being average. Most awakenings are short and probably not remembered. Fitbit\u2019s data suggest that the number of awakenings drops with age until about 45, and then remains flat. Men under 50 have, on average, one more awakening per night than women of the same age, but the discrepancy largely disappears after 50. Fitbit\u2019s research team developed the algorithms to gather and analyze all these data under the guidance of Shelten Yuen. Yuen, 36, who has a Ph.D. in engineering sciences, has worked in missile defense and has done research in surgical robotics. He was approached by Fitbit\u2019s co-founders back in 2010 to write the software underlying the wearable device they were envisioning. \u201cCrazy sensor thing?\u201d Yuen remembers thinking. \u201cThat\u2019s my deal.\u201d He signed on as employee No. 4. \u201cWe need to take the veil off of sleep,\u201d says Shelten Yuen, who leads Fitbit\u2019s research team and wrote the original software that tracks Fitbit users\u2019 movement and sleep.Photograph by Ian Allen for Fortune The first goal for Fitbit was tracking steps. Yuen figured it would be a snap\u2014until he realized that a regular accelerometer can\u2019t distinguish between a wrist that\u2019s moving with a walking gait and a wrist that\u2019s, say, shoveling food. He delivered what he thought was the perfect device. \u201cThey said, \u2018Did you try scratching your head? Did you put it in your pocket? How about strapped to a bra?\u2019 Suddenly it became a crazy, phenomenally hard problem,\u201d he remembers. Steps are easy compared with sleep. For starters, what\u2019s the difference between an absence of movement while trying to sleep and actual sleep? Wearables are beginning to incorporate heart-rate monitoring, which helps correlate sleep stages, but they don\u2019t measure respiration or neural activity like a polysomnograph and so rely more heavily on inference. Fitbit encounters skepticism from users, including me, about the accuracy of its sleep measurement. Yuen admits he hasn\u2019t achieved perfection, but he largely brushes off the incredulity, saying it stems from the fact that our instincts for how well we\u2019re sleeping don\u2019t typically match reality. For steps, users can monitor their progress, but not so with sleep. (For his part, Kahn insists that he has the formula for maximum accuracy: He says his huge quantity of rock-solid polysomnography data and wristband sleep-tracking information have helped him develop an algorithm that adjusts for the imperfections of wristband data.) Whatever the accuracy of Fitbit\u2019s data, the company has a ton of it, and is seeing some interesting patterns. Yuen calls one of his data scientists, Jacob Arnold, 31, into the conference room at Fitbit headquarters in San Francisco\u2019s South of Market neighborhood. Arnold also has a Ph.D., his in astronomy and astrophysics. Together they unveil some graphs demonstrating that people around the world get more sleep in winter and less in summer. Daylight clearly has an effect on sleep patterns; temperature might too. We sleep less on the hottest day of the year than on the longest day. The data show that the longest average duration of sleep usually occurs on the weekend following New Year\u2019s Day. Yuen also makes it clear that getting a lot of sleep is not equivalent to having a restful night. Yuen and Arnold then reveal a graph demonstrating that, statistically speaking, no one gets less sleep than the demographic group to which I belong, forty-something males. I\u2019m not sure how to take the news. Is it a body blow or a hopeful sign of more rest in my future? Establishing the norm the way these charts do is an important step from a scientific standpoint. But to be indispensable in the marketplace, Fitbit needs to empower users with real guidance. \u201cWe need to take the veil off of sleep,\u201d says Yuen. \u201cWe need to make this data much more understandable so they don\u2019t feel powerless.\u201d Fitbit co-founder and CEO James Park echoes the sentiment. Some analysts are predicting that fitness trackers have peaked, especially because of the launch of the Apple Watch (which doesn\u2019t track slumber because it needs to be charged every night). Park knows that if he can help his customers sleep better, Fitbit will become irreplaceable. \u201cA lot of clinical studies show that certain behaviors might affect sleep: light levels, noise levels, caffeine, time of exercise,\u201d says Park. \u201cThe next step is to tie prescriptive elements into it. That\u2019s one of the big opportunities for this category. Can companies actually deliver coaching services to help people sleep that consumers actually want to pay for?\u201d Not long after meeting Steve Kay, dean of the Dornsife school of arts and sciences at the University of Southern California, I notice he\u2019s wearing a Fitbit. Curious about what kind of a sleeper one of the world\u2019s leading experts in circadian rhythm would be, I ask how he\u2019d fared the night before. He looks at the app on his phone. \u201cI went to bed at a quarter past 11 and got up at 20 past four,\u201d he says with a shake of the head. Count Kay among the many of us getting less rest than we need. I\u2019m in Kay\u2019s conference room with Ross Bersot, a venture partner at Bay City Capital turned entrepreneur. Bersot, 40, and Kay, 53, are a latter-day Zalmon Simmons and Harry Johnson. A few years ago, Kay published research demonstrating that it\u2019s possible to isolate and manipulate the speed of an organism\u2019s circadian rhythm using molecular compounds. Bersot provided funding to Kay\u2019s lab in hopes of potentially starting a company based on more detailed findings. That company, Reset Therapeutics, is now real and based in the Bay Area. Like Fullpower and Fitbit, Reset is intent on getting to the heart of the nature of sleep. But while others duke it out for wrist real estate, Reset is going deep into our bodies with a different set of tools. It\u2019s pairing Kay\u2019s research with the latest advances in genomics and high-throughput screening, and partnering with personal-genetics startup 23andMe to try to develop a drug that can manipulate our circadian rhythm. Almost every living thing on earth has an internal clock\u2014or more accurately, a symphony of clocks ticking away at the cellular level\u2014that tells its owner when to rest and when to produce. It\u2019s not just humans. Monsanto recently published a paper demonstrating that it could boost soybean yields 5% by tweaking one of the plant\u2019s clock-associated genes. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to help them figure out why,\u201d says Kay, whose lab is working with Monsanto. \u201cAnd all the major ag and biotech companies are interested. When you\u2019re a plant stuck in the ground, everything is circadian. Biomass, yield, response to extreme temperatures\u2014it\u2019s all clock regulated.\u201d Human clocks are equally powerful, but we aren\u2019t quite as enslaved by them because we don\u2019t depend on photosynthesis. By some estimates, up to 70% of us live in spite of our internal clocks, or in the scientific jargon, outside our chronotype. Your chronotype predisposes you to being a night owl or a morning person or even being hungry at certain times, and many of us are guilty of ignoring our chronotypes, whether because of our lifestyle or just the call of duty. When we live largely out of sync with our chronotypes, we experience everything from grogginess and reduced productivity to digestion issues, weight gain, and accelerated aging. We also increase our risk of obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Kay cites studies that link such lifestyles to an increased rate of breast cancer. \u201cWe evolved to adapt on this planet that has periods of light and dark. But modern life is really clashing with that,\u201d he says. \u201cThe key is being internally synchronized. Your sleep-wake cycles, your food-intake cycles, your metabolic cycles are all working together. When they\u2019re out of sync, that\u2019s when (a) you feel lousy, and (b) you start seeing the disturbance of all kinds of markers. Sleep efficiency collapses. Leptin plummets. Insulin goes up.\u201d Reset wants to tweak our clocks with a drug. Such a drug would help reset the chronotypes of people who choose or need to live a different lifestyle or whose clocks are impaired. For now the development phase is limited to two so-called orphan diseases, narcolepsy\u2014a neurological disorder that causes significant daytime sleepiness and in some cases cataplectic attacks\u2014and Cushing\u2019s disease, a neuroendocrine disorder characterized by excess blood sugar, obesity, and pituitary tumors. Working with orphan diseases enables the company to help people sooner and get on the fast track to regulatory approval. \u201cWith the Cushing\u2019s program, we\u2019re focused on a protein that makes a clock run at a 24-hour cycle,\u201d says Bersot. And so far, so good: \u201cWe\u2019re restoring the rhythms to a 24-hour period, and in our early work with animals, we\u2019ve seen blood glucose and insulin levels return to normal as a result.\u201d Reset plans to take the Cushing\u2019s drug to clinical trials next year and the narcolepsy treatment after that. Bersot hopes that once the drug establishes its ability to reset the body clock for sufferers of those diseases, Reset will develop it more broadly as a sleep aid for shift workers and anyone else whose clock and lifestyle are misaligned. In the meantime the company is working with 23andMe to explore correlations between chronotypes and various genetic expressions. According to Emily Drabant Conley, 23andMe\u2019s director of business development and a Ph.D. in neuroscience, 80% of 23andMe\u2019s customers allow their genotypes to be used in research. She\u2019s scouring their files in hopes of finding correlations between genotypes and sleep-related survey data. For example, how do people of a given genetic expression most commonly answer these questions: How many hours of sleep do you average? Do you snore? Do you take sleep medication? \u201cSleep is interesting because it\u2019s not like eye color, where you have only five choices. Having a lot of data that you can mine is important,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we\u2019re just at the beginning. We\u2019ve done the first pass at the genetics of being a morning person. We know that genetics plays a role in whether you need six hours or eight hours. The prescriptive aspect will come.\u201d It\u2019s a common refrain, and despite the way it may sound to someone yearning for rest, it\u2019s hardly a cop-out. In the realm of data science there\u2019s a commonly accepted notion of how progress occurs. First comes descriptive analytics, next predictive analytics, and finally prescriptive analytics. In other words, describe the system, predict outcomes based on those descriptions, and prescribe actions to attain desired outcomes. To the layperson, prescription may sound like the most difficult phase, but in reality the hardest part is often where we are today, measuring and mapping behavior just to get to the point where it\u2019s conceivable to predict behavior and prescribe actions. Science is clearly advancing in the quest to understand sleep. We\u2019re adding data in quantities that were unimaginable even a decade ago, much less during the time that Fortune first considered the subject. Big Pharma and biotech companies are drilling into our genomes to find links between DNA and nighttime routines; they\u2019re also exploring medications that adjust the circadian rhythm. Wearable-device companies are casting nets far and wide. Fitbit recently enabled its devices to track sleep automatically, rather than as a user-triggered behavior, and some of its devices now monitor heart rate, which helps Yuen and Arnold make finer distinctions between lack of motion and restful sleep. Full-power just entered a partnership with Simmons to provide sleep-tracking technology for the mattress maker\u2019s new Sleeptracker Smartbed, which will provide noninvasive sleep-monitoring technology and is scheduled to hit the market in 2016. On top of all this, scientists around the world are using cheap wearables to conduct their own exploratory research. A quick search of Google Scholar shows dozens of wearable-powered experiments and papers detailing the efforts to unravel the mysteries of the night. All of which will\u2014one day soon, let\u2019s hope\u2014translate to a more personalized analysis and formula for how each of us can get a better night\u2019s sleep. Which brings me back to my night in Fullpower\u2019s sleep lab. A few days after my test I received a PSG report that shines a light on my own personal darkness. The prognosis was mixed. The good news: My sleep-efficiency score was a robust 93.5%\u2014\u201cYou should be proud of that,\u201d says Kahn\u2014which means that most of the time I\u2019m in bed, I\u2019m sleeping. And I\u2019m quick. I drifted off in 2.5 minutes, even with all those wires attached. The bad: I snored. In fact, I was diagnosed with \u201cmild to moderate\u201d apnea. That officially makes me part of the $165 billion problem. I was advised to see a doctor. That\u2019s not the prescription I was looking for. I\u2019m not crazy about doctors, and I\u2019m afraid of being persuaded to buy a machine that I won\u2019t use. So for now, I think I\u2019ll just keep trying to do what I know to be right. Exercise. Keep a consistent routine. Restrict the hours that I eat, try to lay off the junk food and booze, and hope that before long someone will offer me a more personalized regimen. Until then, I\u2019ll always have the memory of a laughing, volleying Marissa Mayer and the knowledge that together, on one strange night in Santa Cruz, we\u2014and whatever caused my 17 other REM interruptions\u2014slept, or at least tried to, in the name of progress.

The article chronicled the merits of everything from Ovaltine to morphine and Barbital, a synthetic hypnotic that was used as a sleep aid until the mid-1950s despite being habit-forming and occasionally deadly. The story also unpacked the relationship between Zalmon G. Simmons and Harry M. Johnson. Simmons was the president of the eponymous company his father founded, which has by now sold nearly 100 million mattresses, most notably under the Beautyrest brand. Johnson was a psychology professor at Ohio State who was conducting sleep research on the side.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"p2\"\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"s3\"\u003EAt the time, old Zalmon was looking to solve two problems: He needed to sell more mattresses. And he needed sleep. The head of the iconic mattress maker was an insomniac! So he gave Johnson $25,000 to set up a sleep lab at the university now known as Carnegie Mellon. At the time it was believed that normal sleepers lay motionless throughout the night. Johnson collected 2.5 million data points from 160 subjects and demonstrated the folly of that theory. Normal sleepers, he determined, change positions from 20 to 85 times a night, with 35 being a sort of sweet spot. When we toss and turn more, we wake up groggy; any less, and we\u2019re stiff and sore. (The insight would pay dividends for Simmons, the company. Spurred by the revelation that proper sleep required movement, it became the first to introduce king and queen-size mattresses. Unfortunately, Zalmon didn\u2019t solve his personal problem. His insomnia devolved into depression and, in the words of the article, his \u201cfortune began to wobble. Soon after that, sleep ceased to be a problem. For Zalmon G.
