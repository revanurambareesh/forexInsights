	', ABOUT Coimbatore', 
	', Coimbatore also known as Kovai, is a major city in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It is the second largest city 
	and urban agglomeration in the state after Chennai and the sixteenth largest urban agglomeration in India. It is administered by the Coimbatore Municipal Corporation and is the 
	administrative capital of Coimbatore district. It is one of the fastest growing tier-II cities in India and a major textile, industrial, commercial, educational, information 
	technology, healthcare and manufacturing hub of Tamil Nadu. It is often referred to as the "Manchester of South India" due to its cotton production and textile industries. 
	Coimbatore is also referred to as the "the Pump City" as it supplies two thirds of India's requirements of motors and pumps. The city is one of the largest exporters of jewellery, 
	wet grinders, poultry and auto components and the term "Coimbatore Wet Grinder" has been given a Geographical indication. The city is located on the banks of Noyyal river surrounded 
	by the Western Ghats.', 

	Coimbatore was the capital city of the historical Kongu Nadu and was ruled by the Cheras as it served as the eastern entrance to the Palakkad Gap, the principal trade route between 
	the west coast and Tamil Nadu. Coimbatore was in the middle of the Roman trade route that extended from Muziris to Arikamedu in South India. The medieval Cholas conquered the Kongu Nadu 
	in the 10th century CE. The region was ruled by Vijayanagara Empire in the 15th century followed by the Nayaks who introduced the Palayakkarar system under which Kongu nadu region was 
	divided into 24 Palayams. In the later part of the 18th century, the Coimbatore region came under the Kingdom of Mysore and following the defeat of Tipu Sultan in the Anglo-Mysore Wars, 
	the British East India Company annexed Coimbatore to the Madras Presidency in 1799. The Coimbatore region played a prominent role in the Second Poligar War (1801) when it was the area 
	of operations of Dheeran Chinnamalai. In 1804, Coimbatore was established as the capital of the newly formed Coimbatore district and in 1866 it was accorded municipality status with 
	Robert Stanes as its Chairman. The city experienced a textile boom in the early 19th century due to the decline of the cotton industry in Mumbai. Post independence, Coimbatore has seen 
	rapid growth due to industrialisation.', 

	Coimbatore was ranked the best emerging city in India by India Today in the 2014 annual Indian city survey. The city has been ranked 4th among Indian cities in investment 
	climate by CII[28] and ranked 17th among the top global outsourcing cities by Tholons',
