They use analytical (non-numerical) methods for fast  execution and easy data requirements. The programs have history-matching  features to graphically compare calculated and actual rates, enabling  estimation of reservoir properties (e.g. horizontal or vertical permeability,  drainage area, etc.) from production history. JTI.Horizontal and ProCone have  sensitivity features to show the effect of variables or unknowns on rates and  reserves in graphical form. JTI.Horizontal calculates either rates or pressure  versus time for vertical, hydraulically fractured, horizontal, or multiple  fractured horizontal wells.  PROCONE performs coning calculations for  vertical or horizontal wells.  MultiLateral Horizontal calculates either  rates or pressure versus time of reservoirs with multiple drainholes that can be  used for stand-alone evaluations or as a screening tool for more in-depth  studies.',
