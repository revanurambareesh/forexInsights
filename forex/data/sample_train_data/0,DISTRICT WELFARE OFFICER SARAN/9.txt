Four girls and a boy have lost their lives due to these social conflicts. The earlier incidents involved young boys and girls from different castes.
", u"While an eerie silence prevailed in the house of the girl who was killed by her father today, men and women were seen wailing at the boy's house. A large number of villagers turned up to express sympathy at the boy's house and condole the death.", According to the village sarpanch, the girl's father, Chamkaur Singh, a private veterinary doctor has shown no remorse for hacking his daughter and the boy to death. He said the police arrived at their house 30 minutes after making a phone call. "When the police failed to find the house after making numerous rounds of various streets, I then showed them the path, which led to a few minutes of delay. Else, the police would have reached in time after the crime," the sarpanch said.', The badly mutilated bodies of the girl-Manjinder Kaur (20) and Simarjit Singh (25), were sent for postmortem examination.', In the earlier incidents, a 20-year-old girl from a Jatt Sikh family from Gehribara Singh village was shot dead by her father. The father was upset over his daughter falling in love with a boy from the Ghumiar caste. The two solemnised their marriage in the High Court. The girl was killed six months after her marriage. The police said the father failed to bear the pressure created by the everyday enquiries made by relatives and friends about his daughter and son-in-law.', The girl was shot at in Rajgarh Kubbe village by the father on March 15 last year with a licensed rifle.', u"In the other incident, a girl from Khokhar village of Mansa, had married a bus conductor against the wishes of her parents and was killed. Her husband, Ramphal Singh Bagga, said despite the registration of a case of murder against the girl's father, the accused had managed to come out of jail and was now roaming free. An affluent farmer, the girl's father was sent behind the bars for a few months but came out, Bagga said.", u"In the third incident, a girl from Gehribara Singhwala village, fell in love with a boy from Maur Mandi. The girl, a student of Class XII, eloped with him after running away from home. The two, fearing the wrath of the girl's family, consumed poison. While the girl died, the boy survived. The boy was, however, booked by the police on the basis of a complaint by the girl's family for killing and kidnapping her.",

        Bathinda city and its adjoining areas heaved a sigh of relief on Thursday after intermittent rains lowered the temperature and gave the residents relief from the hot and harsh weather which had been prevailing in the area for the last couple of weeks.
', After braving scorching sunlight for almost three continuous weeks, the area received 3.6mm of rainfall on Wednesday evening and the intervening night of Wednesday and Thursday. Although the city woke up to a sunny morning today, the weather turned pleasant again in the afternoon after the sky was covered with clouds. ', The cloud cover didn\u2019t disappoint as several parts of the city received rainfall at around 4 pm. The rainfall lowered the temperature by several notches. As per the Agri-met Department of Punjab Agricultural University Regional Centre in  Bathinda, while the maximum temperature was recorded at 37.4 degree Celsius, the minimum temperature was recorded at 25.4 degree Celsius.', While the rainfall brought respite from the hot weather, it increased the humidity levels. On Thursday, the maximum humidity was recorded at 85 to 90 per cent and minimum at 55-60 per cent. The wind velocity was recorded at 12.5 kmph.', According to Dr Rajkumar of the PAU Regional Centre in Bathinda, the region was scheduled to experience a weak monsoon. \u201cJune is not a monsoon month for Punjab. Whatever rainfall the state receives in June is caused by western disturbance or ripple effects of El Nino or La Nina. Depending on the two factors, the amount of rainfall received by the state in June fluctuates drastically.\u201d', Talking about the monsoon this year, he said, \u201cThe monsoon is weaker by 30 to 40 per cent this year. Anyway, Bathinda is not known for receiving a lot of rainfall even in the monsoon season. This year too, the picture looks grim.\u201d',

        Bathinda district found frequent mention in the budget speech of the Punjab Finance Minister Parminder Singh Dhindsa. Portending good news for the frequent fliers, Dhinda stated that construction of the building of Civil Enclave, Bathinda, at the site was complete and ready for commissioning.
', He added that the Ministry of Defence, the Government of India, has accorded its approval for starting two civil commercial flights from the Indian Air Force Station, Bhisiana, near Bathinda. Forty acres of land worth Rs.3.55 crore at Virk Kalan village has been handed over to the Airport Authority of India for the construction of the civil air terminal, he stated.', Under the education section, Dhindsa spoke about the state\u2019s aim to provide quality education to poor and meritorious students of government schools by setting up six residential schools with a capacity of 500 students each in the districts of Amritsar, Bathinda, Jalandhar, Ludhiana, Mohali and Patiala.', He further stated that an eight-lane synthetic athletics track would be laid at the Multipurpose Stadium, Bathinda, at a cost of Rs 6.48 crore. Giving hope to the cancer patients, the finance minister announced that the 100-bed Advanced Cancer Diagnostic Treatment & Research Centre at Bathinda, built at a cost of Rs 60 crore, will be operational soon.

Allocation of Rs 40 crore to give  boost to the emergency medical services (108 ambulance and 104 medical helpline) are steps in the right direction. Generous allocations have been made to upgrade government sector hospitals and setting up an AIIMS-like institution, but little thought has been given to the support system.

        The ever rising number of road accidents on the roads in the city has again exposed the government\u2019s claims of tackling the problem in an effective manner.
', In the last 16 days, four persons have died, while more than 73 have been injured in various road accidents in the city.', Four persons died and seven were injured on July 2 while ten persons were injured on July 12 in various road accidents in the city. On an average, five persons were injured in the city on a daily basis in road accidents.', Today also, three persons were injured in various road accidents.', In one incident, a motorcyclist was injured in a collision with an auto-rickshaw on Dhobiana road near the Cantonment area. In another incident, at around 11 pm at night on Bibiwala road, an unidentified vehicle hit a scooter, in which one person who was driving it was seriously injured.', One motorcyclist  was injured in another incident after being hit by a car in Panchavati Nagar .', Two persons riding a motorcycle were injured yesterday in a road accident at Hanuman chowk. Two persons travelling on a motorcycle hit the car and received injuries. They were taken to the Civil Hospital by the volunteers of the NGO Sahara Jan Sewa.', City residents and volunteers of the NGOs said the violation of traffic rules,
        over speeding and wrong calculating in overtaking on narrow roads is a major cause of accidents for many commuters plying on the road.', Vijay Goel, president, Sahara Jan Sewa, said in the last 16 days, their volunteers have taken 43 persons injured in road accidents to the Civil Hospital for treatment. He stated that the carefree attitude towards maintenance of roads is a major reason behind the rising number of accidents in the city. All the major roads of the city are full of potholes and the administration has turned a blind eye to it.', Sonu Maheshwari, president of the NGO Naujawan Welfare Society said they had taken 30 persons to the Civil Hospital this month so far for medical assistance after they were injured in mishaps. He claimed that a major reason behind the rise in number of accidents is that the police has failed to create traffic awareness and are busy in just issuing challans.', Paramjit Singh, traffic in-charge, said a major reason behind the road accidents in the city is that people are always in quite hurry these days, due to which they drive rashly, due to which over speeding has been the main reason behind the accidents.', Residents also raised questions as to why no signboards on speed limits have been installed in the city, whereas in all the major cities, these signboards to make the residents aware of the traffic rules have been put up.',

        Members or guests visiting the clubs in the city need not worry about sticking to a dress code since the clubs don\u2019t have strict dress code rules chalked out, barring a few which say that bathroom slippers and shorts are not allowed.
', This revelation has come in the wake of Madras High Court Judge, Justice D Hariparanthaman, being denied entry into the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association Club recently for wearing a dhoti. The judge was to attend a book release function. Giving two hoots to his credentials, the judge was stopped by the staff for violating the dress code of the club.', While the incident has stoked a controversy across the nation on whether the clubs should continue to adhere to strict dress codes or not, Bathinda clubs\u2019 charter of dress code is not a long one. When asked if they had a dress code and imposed it on their members and guests, the Clubs shared that only two clothing and footwear items\u2013bathroom slippers and shorts\u2013were not allowed.', At the Civil Lines Club, one of the oldest clubs of the city, the staff has been directed not to stop but \u201cpolitely tell\u201d the guests, wearing either chappals or shorts, that their attire is inappropriate. Cultural secretary of the club, Jaideep Nayyar said, \u201cWe don\u2019t have a long list of Dos and Don\u2019ts when it comes to dress code. We have barred only two items and have told out staff to politely speak to the guests.\u201d', He added that shorts were allowed in the sports area but if the same person wanted to dine at the restaurant, he/she would have to change. Elaborating on the favourite attire of many in the city, kurta pyjama, he said while
        the kurta-pyjama-chappal combination was not allowed, if the same was clubbed with Kolhapuri juttis or shoes, then it was permissible.', Harichand Verma, manager at the Dunes Club, also stated the chappals and shorts were not allowed inside the club. When asked if there had ever been any instance wherein a guest was barred from entering the club, he said, \u201cVery rarely do people turn up wearing inappropriate clothes or footwear. Whenever there has been such a case, we tell the guests that what they are wearing is not right.\u201d', HBN Country Club, is not a members-only club and hence, has no dress code. Manoj Gupta, who is running the club, said, \u201cMembers from the higher socio-economic strata come to our club and it has never happened that any guest has come wearing something which is not suitable.\u201d',

Apart from damaging the vehicles, it poses a risk to the lives of commuters,\u201d said Gurdeep Kaur, a resident of Model Town.', \u201cWhen we raised a hue and cry, some workers turned up today and filled the potholes temporarily,\u201d he added. Another resident, Kapil Sharma, said most of the roads in Model Town Phase-III were still inundated.',  The rainwater had accumulated on the road in front of the Civil Lines police station despite the laying of water pipes for rainwater harvesting. The authorities had laid the pipes to drain out water from the low-lying areas.', Meanwhile, many road accidents were reported in the city following showers as commuters failed to notice the potholes filled with water. ', Two road accidents, involving children, were reported at Power House Road and Bhagu Road. ', \u201cI tried to escape a splash when my scooter hit a deep pothole near the gurdwara of Model Town Phase-I,\u201d said Rahul Singh, a resident of Model Town Phase-II.

A large number of villagers turned up to express sympathy at the boy's house and condole the death.", According to the village sarpanch, the girl's father, Chamkaur Singh, a private veterinary doctor has shown no remorse for hacking his daughter and the boy to death. He said the police arrived at their house 30 minutes after making a phone call. "When the police failed to find the house after making numerous rounds of various streets, I then showed them the path, which led to a few minutes of delay. Else, the police would have reached in time after the crime," the sarpanch said.', The badly mutilated bodies of the girl-Manjinder Kaur (20) and Simarjit Singh (25), were sent for postmortem examination.', In the earlier incidents, a 20-year-old girl from a Jatt Sikh family from Gehribara Singh village was shot dead by her father. The father was upset over his daughter falling in love with a boy from the Ghumiar caste. The two solemnised their marriage in the High Court. The girl was killed six months after her marriage. The police said the father failed to bear the pressure created by the everyday enquiries made by relatives and friends about his daughter and son-in-law.', The girl was shot at in Rajgarh Kubbe village by the father on March 15 last year with a licensed rifle.', u"In the other incident, a girl from Khokhar village of Mansa, had married a bus conductor against the wishes of her parents and was killed. Her husband, Ramphal Singh Bagga, said despite the registration of a case of murder against the girl's father, the accused had managed to come out of jail and was now roaming free. An affluent farmer, the girl's father was sent behind the bars for a few months but came out, Bagga said.", u"In the third incident, a girl from Gehribara Singhwala village, fell in love with a boy from Maur Mandi. The girl, a student of Class XII, eloped with him after running away from home. The two, fearing the wrath of the girl's family, consumed poison. While the girl died, the boy survived. The boy was, however, booked by the police on the basis of a complaint by the girl's family for killing and kidnapping her.",

        Bathinda city and its adjoining areas heaved a sigh of relief on Thursday after intermittent rains lowered the temperature and gave the residents relief from the hot and harsh weather which had been prevailing in the area for the last couple of weeks.
', After braving scorching sunlight for almost three continuous weeks, the area received 3.6mm of rainfall on Wednesday evening and the intervening night of Wednesday and Thursday. Although the city woke up to a sunny morning today, the weather turned pleasant again in the afternoon after the sky was covered with clouds. ', The cloud cover didn\u2019t disappoint as several parts of the city received rainfall at around 4 pm. The rainfall lowered the temperature by several notches. As per the Agri-met Department of Punjab Agricultural University Regional Centre in  Bathinda, while the maximum temperature was recorded at 37.4 degree Celsius, the minimum temperature was recorded at 25.4 degree Celsius.', While the rainfall brought respite from the hot weather, it increased the humidity levels. On Thursday, the maximum humidity was recorded at 85 to 90 per cent and minimum at 55-60 per cent. The wind velocity was recorded at 12.5 kmph.', According to Dr Rajkumar of the PAU Regional Centre in Bathinda, the region was scheduled to experience a weak monsoon. \u201cJune is not a monsoon month for Punjab. Whatever rainfall the state receives in June is caused by western disturbance or ripple effects of El Nino or La Nina. Depending on the two factors, the amount of rainfall received by the state in June fluctuates drastically.\u201d', Talking about the monsoon this year, he said, \u201cThe monsoon is weaker by 30 to 40 per cent this year. Anyway, Bathinda is not known for receiving a lot of rainfall even in the monsoon season. This year too, the picture looks grim.\u201d',

        Bathinda district found frequent mention in the budget speech of the Punjab Finance Minister Parminder Singh Dhindsa. Portending good news for the frequent fliers, Dhinda stated that construction of the building of Civil Enclave, Bathinda, at the site was complete and ready for commissioning.
', He added that the Ministry of Defence, the Government of India, has accorded its approval for starting two civil commercial flights from the Indian Air Force Station, Bhisiana, near Bathinda. Forty acres of land worth Rs.3.55 crore at Virk Kalan village has been handed over to the Airport Authority of India for the construction of the civil air terminal, he stated.', Under the education section, Dhindsa spoke about the state\u2019s aim to provide quality education to poor and meritorious students of government schools by setting up six residential schools with a capacity of 500 students each in the districts of Amritsar, Bathinda, Jalandhar, Ludhiana, Mohali and Patiala.', He further stated that an eight-lane synthetic athletics track would be laid at the Multipurpose Stadium, Bathinda, at a cost of Rs 6.48 crore. Giving hope to the cancer patients, the finance minister announced that the 100-bed Advanced Cancer Diagnostic Treatment & Research Centre at Bathinda, built at a cost of Rs 60 crore, will be operational soon.

Allocation of Rs 40 crore to give  boost to the emergency medical services (108 ambulance and 104 medical helpline) are steps in the right direction. Generous allocations have been made to upgrade government sector hospitals and setting up an AIIMS-like institution, but little thought has been given to the support system.

        The ever rising number of road accidents on the roads in the city has again exposed the government\u2019s claims of tackling the problem in an effective manner.
', In the last 16 days, four persons have died, while more than 73 have been injured in various road accidents in the city.', Four persons died and seven were injured on July 2 while ten persons were injured on July 12 in various road accidents in the city. On an average, five persons were injured in the city on a daily basis in road accidents.', Today also, three persons were injured in various road accidents.', In one incident, a motorcyclist was injured in a collision with an auto-rickshaw on Dhobiana road near the Cantonment area. In another incident, at around 11 pm at night on Bibiwala road, an unidentified vehicle hit a scooter, in which one person who was driving it was seriously injured.', One motorcyclist  was injured in another incident after being hit by a car in Panchavati Nagar .', Two persons riding a motorcycle were injured yesterday in a road accident at Hanuman chowk. Two persons travelling on a motorcycle hit the car and received injuries. They were taken to the Civil Hospital by the volunteers of the NGO Sahara Jan Sewa.', City residents and volunteers of the NGOs said the violation of traffic rules,
        over speeding and wrong calculating in overtaking on narrow roads is a major cause of accidents for many commuters plying on the road.', Vijay Goel, president, Sahara Jan Sewa, said in the last 16 days, their volunteers have taken 43 persons injured in road accidents to the Civil Hospital for treatment. He stated that the carefree attitude towards maintenance of roads is a major reason behind the rising number of accidents in the city. All the major roads of the city are full of potholes and the administration has turned a blind eye to it.', Sonu Maheshwari, president of the NGO Naujawan Welfare Society said they had taken 30 persons to the Civil Hospital this month so far for medical assistance after they were injured in mishaps. He claimed that a major reason behind the rise in number of accidents is that the police has failed to create traffic awareness and are busy in just issuing challans.', Paramjit Singh, traffic in-charge, said a major reason behind the road accidents in the city is that people are always in quite hurry these days, due to which they drive rashly, due to which over speeding has been the main reason behind the accidents.', Residents also raised questions as to why no signboards on speed limits have been installed in the city, whereas in all the major cities, these signboards to make the residents aware of the traffic rules have been put up.',

        Members or guests visiting the clubs in the city need not worry about sticking to a dress code since the clubs don\u2019t have strict dress code rules chalked out, barring a few which say that bathroom slippers and shorts are not allowed.
', This revelation has come in the wake of Madras High Court Judge, Justice D Hariparanthaman, being denied entry into the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association Club recently for wearing a dhoti. The judge was to attend a book release function. Giving two hoots to his credentials, the judge was stopped by the staff for violating the dress code of the club.', While the incident has stoked a controversy across the nation on whether the clubs should continue to adhere to strict dress codes or not, Bathinda clubs\u2019 charter of dress code is not a long one. When asked if they had a dress code and imposed it on their members and guests, the Clubs shared that only two clothing and footwear items\u2013bathroom slippers and shorts\u2013were not allowed.', At the Civil Lines Club, one of the oldest clubs of the city, the staff has been directed not to stop but \u201cpolitely tell\u201d the guests, wearing either chappals or shorts, that their attire is inappropriate. Cultural secretary of the club, Jaideep Nayyar said, \u201cWe don\u2019t have a long list of Dos and Don\u2019ts when it comes to dress code. We have barred only two items and have told out staff to politely speak to the guests.\u201d', He added that shorts were allowed in the sports area but if the same person wanted to dine at the restaurant, he/she would have to change. Elaborating on the favourite attire of many in the city, kurta pyjama, he said while
        the kurta-pyjama-chappal combination was not allowed, if the same was clubbed with Kolhapuri juttis or shoes, then it was permissible.', Harichand Verma, manager at the Dunes Club, also stated the chappals and shorts were not allowed inside the club. When asked if there had ever been any instance wherein a guest was barred from entering the club, he said, \u201cVery rarely do people turn up wearing inappropriate clothes or footwear. Whenever there has been such a case, we tell the guests that what they are wearing is not right.\u201d', HBN Country Club, is not a members-only club and hence, has no dress code. Manoj Gupta, who is running the club, said, \u201cMembers from the higher socio-economic strata come to our club and it has never happened that any guest has come wearing something which is not suitable.\u201d',
