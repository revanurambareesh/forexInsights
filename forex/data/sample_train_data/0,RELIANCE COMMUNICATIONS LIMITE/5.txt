However, RCom\u0027s ownership of a pan-India spectrum in 800MHz\/850MHz and its ability to offer faster 4G data services could help it fend off the competition, to some extent, according to Fitch Ratings.The firm said that RCom\u0027s IDR is constrained by its weak market position as the fourth-largest telco in India with a revenue market share of around 8% and a subscriber base of mostly low-revenue customers.The top-three telcos - Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India and Idea Cellular- have been gradually gaining market share and now account for about 70% of wireless revenue in India\u0027s telecoms market.\u0022We forecast FCF will be limited in FY17 as Rcom needs to invest around Rs 40bn (FY16: Rs 34bn - excluding a one-off spectrum payment of Rs 11bn) on capex to support its fast-growing data traffic and to improve the quality of voice services. However, its capex\/revenue of around 17%-18% will still be below than top-three telcos\u0027 average of 19%-20% due to its infrastructure and spectrum-sharing arrangement with Reliance Jio,\u0022 the ratings firm said.In January 2016, RCom said that it would share and pool its 800MHz spectrum with Reliance Jio in 17 regions. Rcom has future plans to share 800MHz spectrum in the remaining five circles. Spectrum sharing will give Rcom access to a wider band of spectrum and Jio\u0027s network to provide faster 4G data services and provide capex and operating costs savings.RCom and Reliance Jio signed reciprocal infrastructure agreements during FY14-15 to share Rcom\u0027s 43,000 towers, 120,000km of inter-city fibre, and 70,000km intra-city fibre network for the next 17-20 years. Under the agreements, Rcom also has access to existing and future towers and fibre assets of Reliance Jio.The ratings firm reckons that RCom\u0027s acquisition of Sistema Shyam Teleservices Ltd (SSTL), the Indian mobile subsidiary of Russia\u0027s Sistema JSFC, in an all-stock deal is credit neutral for Rcom, at least in the short term. RCom will benefit from additional nine million subscribers and Rs 15bn revenue and also will be able to extend the life of its 800MHz spectrum in eight Indian circles.\u0022However, we believe that in FY17 incremental EBITDA from the acquisition will likely fall short of SSTL\u0027s annual spectrum cost of Rs3.9bn - the cost of the spectrum SSTL acquired in the March 2013 auction will be paid annually over 10 years starting FY17. In the longer term we expect that growth in incremental EBITDA may make the transaction cash-flow positive. SSTL will pay off its existing debt before the acquisition,\u0022 the firm said.The firm expects competition to intensify in Indian market as Reliance Jio enters the market with cheaper tariff plans and faster data speeds, and armed with sufficient spectrum and access to funds. We expect the industry blended monthly average revenue per user (ARPU) to fall due to a decline in data tariffs, which will more than offset the rise in data usage.RCom\u0027s FY17 blended ARPU, however, is likely to decline by 1%-2% compared with a 5%-6% decline in the industry\u0027s blended ARPU. This is because Rcom\u0027s ARPU of Rs 140 is already lower than the industry average of Rs 170.RCom\u0027s liquidity, according to Fitch, is dependent on its ability to refinance its maturing debt because its cash generation and unrestricted cash of Rs 22bn are insufficient to pay its short-term debt of Rs143bn. Banks have been willing to lend on a secured basis with licences and immovable assets as collateral.","keywords":"","url":"http:\/\/telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com\/news\/reliance-communications-to-face-rising-threat-from-reliance-jio-says-fitch\/51250165","articleSection":null,"description":"RCom\u0027s ownership of a pan-India spectrum in 800MHz\/850MHz and its ability to offer faster 4G data services could help it fend off the competition, to some extent, according to Fitch Ratings.","author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Danish Khan","url":"http:\/\/telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com\/author\/479206691\/danish-khan"},{"@type":"Person","name":"ET Telecom","url":"http:\/\/telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"ETTelecom","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http:\/\/b2bstatic.iimg.in\/Themes\/Release\/images\/responsive\/telecom-square-logo-v5-min.jpg","width":60,"height":60}},"image":[{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http:\/\/economictimes.indiatimes.com\/thumb\/msid-51250165,width-700,resizemode-4\/.jpg","width":700,"height":525},{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http:\/\/economictimes.indiatimes.com\/thumb\/msid-51250178,width-700,resizemode-4\/.jpg","width":700,"height":525}]}		',

However, RCom\u0027s ownership of a pan-India spectrum in 800MHz\/850MHz and its ability to offer faster 4G data services could help it fend off the competition, to some extent, according to Fitch Ratings.The firm said that RCom\u0027s IDR is constrained by its weak market position as the fourth-largest telco in India with a revenue market share of around 8% and a subscriber base of mostly low-revenue customers.The top-three telcos - Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India and Idea Cellular- have been gradually gaining market share and now account for about 70% of wireless revenue in India\u0027s telecoms market.\u0022We forecast FCF will be limited in FY17 as Rcom needs to invest around Rs 40bn (FY16: Rs 34bn - excluding a one-off spectrum payment of Rs 11bn) on capex to support its fast-growing data traffic and to improve the quality of voice services. However, its capex\/revenue of around 17%-18% will still be below than top-three telcos\u0027 average of 19%-20% due to its infrastructure and spectrum-sharing arrangement with Reliance Jio,\u0022 the ratings firm said.In January 2016, RCom said that it would share and pool its 800MHz spectrum with Reliance Jio in 17 regions. Rcom has future plans to share 800MHz spectrum in the remaining five circles. Spectrum sharing will give Rcom access to a wider band of spectrum and Jio\u0027s network to provide faster 4G data services and provide capex and operating costs savings.RCom and Reliance Jio signed reciprocal infrastructure agreements during FY14-15 to share Rcom\u0027s 43,000 towers, 120,000km of inter-city fibre, and 70,000km intra-city fibre network for the next 17-20 years. Under the agreements, Rcom also has access to existing and future towers and fibre assets of Reliance Jio.The ratings firm reckons that RCom\u0027s acquisition of Sistema Shyam Teleservices Ltd (SSTL), the Indian mobile subsidiary of Russia\u0027s Sistema JSFC, in an all-stock deal is credit neutral for Rcom, at least in the short term. RCom will benefit from additional nine million subscribers and Rs 15bn revenue and also will be able to extend the life of its 800MHz spectrum in eight Indian circles.\u0022However, we believe that in FY17 incremental EBITDA from the acquisition will likely fall short of SSTL\u0027s annual spectrum cost of Rs3.9bn - the cost of the spectrum SSTL acquired in the March 2013 auction will be paid annually over 10 years starting FY17. In the longer term we expect that growth in incremental EBITDA may make the transaction cash-flow positive. SSTL will pay off its existing debt before the acquisition,\u0022 the firm said.The firm expects competition to intensify in Indian market as Reliance Jio enters the market with cheaper tariff plans and faster data speeds, and armed with sufficient spectrum and access to funds. We expect the industry blended monthly average revenue per user (ARPU) to fall due to a decline in data tariffs, which will more than offset the rise in data usage.RCom\u0027s FY17 blended ARPU, however, is likely to decline by 1%-2% compared with a 5%-6% decline in the industry\u0027s blended ARPU. This is because Rcom\u0027s ARPU of Rs 140 is already lower than the industry average of Rs 170.RCom\u0027s liquidity, according to Fitch, is dependent on its ability to refinance its maturing debt because its cash generation and unrestricted cash of Rs 22bn are insufficient to pay its short-term debt of Rs143bn. Banks have been willing to lend on a secured basis with licences and immovable assets as collateral.","keywords":"","url":"http:\/\/telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com\/news\/reliance-communications-to-face-rising-threat-from-reliance-jio-says-fitch\/51250165","articleSection":null,"description":"RCom\u0027s ownership of a pan-India spectrum in 800MHz\/850MHz and its ability to offer faster 4G data services could help it fend off the competition, to some extent, according to Fitch Ratings.","author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Danish Khan","url":"http:\/\/telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com\/author\/479206691\/danish-khan"},{"@type":"Person","name":"ET Telecom","url":"http:\/\/telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"ETTelecom","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http:\/\/b2bstatic.iimg.in\/Themes\/Release\/images\/responsive\/telecom-square-logo-v5-min.jpg","width":60,"height":60}},"image":[{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http:\/\/economictimes.indiatimes.com\/thumb\/msid-51250165,width-700,resizemode-4\/.jpg","width":700,"height":525},{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http:\/\/economictimes.indiatimes.com\/thumb\/msid-51250178,width-700,resizemode-4\/.jpg","width":700,"height":525}]}		',

However, ', RCom', u"'s ownership of a pan-India spectrum in 800MHz/850MHz and its ability to offer faster 4G data services could help it fend off the competition, to some extent, according to ", Fitch',  Ratings.', u"The firm said that RCom's IDR is constrained by its weak market position as the fourth-largest telco in India with a revenue market share of around 8% and a subscriber base of mostly low-revenue customers.", The top-three telcos - ', Bharti Airtel', u", Vodafone India and Idea Cellular- have been gradually gaining market share and now account for about 70% of wireless revenue in India's telecoms market.", "We forecast FCF will be limited in FY17 as Rcom needs to invest around Rs 40bn (FY16: Rs 34bn - excluding a one-off spectrum payment of Rs 11bn) on capex to support its fast-growing data traffic and to improve the quality of voice services. However, its capex/revenue of around 17%-18% will still be below than top-three telcos' average of 19%-20% due to its infrastructure and spectrum-sharing arrangement with Reliance Jio," the ratings firm said.', u"In January 2016, RCom said that it would share and pool its 800MHz spectrum with Reliance Jio in 17 regions. Rcom has future plans to share 800MHz spectrum in the remaining five circles. Spectrum sharing will give Rcom access to a wider band of spectrum and Jio's network to provide faster 4G data services and provide capex and operating costs savings.", u"RCom and Reliance Jio signed reciprocal infrastructure agreements during FY14-15 to share Rcom's 43,000 towers, 120,000km of inter-city fibre, and 70,000km intra-city fibre network for the next 17-20 years. Under the agreements, Rcom also has access to existing and future towers and fibre assets of Reliance Jio.", u"The ratings firm reckons that RCom's acquisition of ", Sistema', u" Shyam Teleservices Ltd (SSTL), the Indian mobile subsidiary of Russia's Sistema JSFC, in an all-stock deal is credit neutral for Rcom, at least in the short term. RCom will benefit from additional nine million subscribers and Rs 15bn revenue and also will be able to extend the life of its 800MHz spectrum in eight Indian circles.", "However, we believe that in FY17 incremental EBITDA from the acquisition will likely fall short of SSTL's annual spectrum cost of Rs3.9bn - the cost of the spectrum SSTL acquired in the March 2013 auction will be paid annually over 10 years starting FY17. In the longer term we expect that growth in incremental EBITDA may make the transaction cash-flow positive. SSTL will pay off its existing debt before the acquisition," the firm said.', The firm expects competition to intensify in Indian market as Reliance Jio enters the market with cheaper tariff plans and faster data speeds, and armed with sufficient spectrum and access to funds. We expect the industry blended monthly average revenue per user (', ARPU', ) to fall due to a decline in data tariffs, which will more than offset the rise in data usage.', u"RCom's FY17 blended ARPU, however, is likely to decline by 1%-2% compared with a 5%-6% decline in the industry's blended ARPU. This is because Rcom's ARPU of Rs 140 is already lower than the industry average of Rs 170.", u"RCom's liquidity, according to Fitch, is dependent on its ability to refinance its maturing debt because its cash generation and unrestricted cash of Rs 22bn are insufficient to pay its short-term debt of Rs143bn. Banks have been willing to lend on a secured basis with licences and immovable assets as collateral.",
