', Introduction', 

', In India, the term "lapsation" is not directly defined in the
Insurance Act 1938. The Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC)
states that a policy is treated as lapsed if the premium is not
paid within 6 months from the due date.', 

', (It has to be noted that, if a policy has lapsed, the insurer is
obliged to pay back the amount to the policyholder only when it has
"paid-up value".)', 

', Permanent policies acquire paid-up value when premiums under the
policy have been paid for at least three years. The paid-up value
will be proportionate to the sum assured in the same proportion as
the number of premiums paid bears to the total number of premiums
originally payable as per the contract. This paid value is payable
on the maturity date or on the death of the life assured, should
this take place earlier.', 

', The policyholder also has a right to surrender their policy
without waiting for the maturity date, but they would receive a
certain percentage of the paid-up value - the "surrender
value". If the policy lapses before 3 years have passed, the
insurer is not obliged to pay back any amount to the
policyholder.', 

', The last few years have seen regulatory upheavals within the
Indian insurance industry. These changes have seen the industry
change the available product mix in favour of higher-cost
products.', 

', From the opening of the sector until till 2009, around
80% of the industry was made up of unit-linked insurance plans
(ULIPs). However, once the 2010 ULIP guidelines capped costs to an
effective 2.25% over the life of the policy (over a 15-year
period), life companies started showing an interest in producing
and selling more "traditional" plans, in which first-year
commissions can still go as high as 35-40%.', 

', Traditional plans have been growing and now constitute at least
half of life insurance business, whereas ULIPs are facing a
negative growth. Insurers and sellers like traditional plans,
because the seller gets up to 40% of the premium as commission in
the first year and the insurer usually gets to keep the entire
premium if the policyholder lapses the policy (the maximum hit for
customers on a ULIPs policy is now Rs 6,000, instead of the whole
premium).', 

', The life insurance business now functions by hitting customers
with a high-cost product and allowing it to lapse in the first
three years of the policy. Recent reports have clearly shown that,
for some insurance companies, lapsation has become a profitable
tool. A March 2012 Goldman Sachs report shows that, for 2010-11,
the lapsed profits for various companies stood as follows:', 

', 
', ICICI Prudential Life: Rs 730 crore; ', 

', Bajaj Allianz: Rs 367 crore;', 

', HDFC Standard Life Insurance Co. Ltd: Rs 223
crore;', 

', Max New York Life: Rs 184 crore. ', 
', 

', However these profits are short-lived; the report estimates that
the gains from lapsed profit will disappear by the first half of FY
2013 and the pool of profits from lapsed policies will gradually
fade away.', 

', In the long term, companies will need to focus on persistency,
which is a key indicator of an insurer's health. Typically, an
insurer incurs significant acquisition costs in the beginning. It
takes about three to seven years to achieve break-even on a policy.
Bonuses earned by participating plans depend on three factors -
costs, mortality and persistency - and insurance companies with
"leaky buckets" or high lapse ratios will find it progressively
difficult to offer competitive bonus rates.', 

', Though insurers may still be receiving a chunk of profits from
lapsed policies, they will have to look for other ways to sustain
these profits, since lapsed profits are short-lived.  Lapsed
policies show market immaturity - that is, they indicate that
product manufacturers and buyers are still figuring out the right
product mix. In developed markets such as the US and the UK, the
lapsation ratio is less than 10%; in Asian markets it is around
15-20%. However, in India it is more than 20% on average, and
within certain companies it is more than 50%.', 

', In this context, this document focuses on the impact and costs
of - as well as the reasons behind - the lapsation of life
insurance policies. ', 

', Impact of the lapsation of life
insurance policies', 

', Other than fake or bogus policies (defined as "a non-genuine
life insurance contract completed with ulterior motives on the
basis of proposal on the life of a non-existent proposer or on the
life of an existing proposer without his knowledge and/or consent
which are issued by agents, officers, and other personnel and
sometimes in connivance with medical practitioners") the issue
of lapsation of life insurance policies is at a magnitude which
affects not only the policyholder, but also the insurer,
intermediaries, the Indian Government, economy and society as a
whole.', 

', The impact on every concerned party is mentioned below.', 

', Policyholder', 

', If a life insurance policy is taken out to cover the risk of the
life of an insured, with the lapsation of the policy the coverage
of such risk ceases. With such a cessation the immediate family
becomes insecure and at a loss.', 

', Apart from losing the family protection, the policyholder also
loses a portion of the savings - most likely accumulated with
considerable effort over a period of time. The loss is
disproportionately high in the initial stages because of how level
premium systems work. The insured would also be losing the benefit
of returns from alternate investments elsewhere.', 

', The fundamental idea behind a level premium plan is that an
insurance company can accept the same premium each year, provided
that the level premiums collected are the mathematical equivalent
of the corresponding single premium.', 

', As a result, level premiums paid in the early years of the
contract will be more than sufficient to pay current death claims,
but will be less than adequate to meet death claims that occur in
later years. Life insurance is, thus far, one of the first products
marketed on the installment plan.', 

', Even if the policy is made "paid up" (see above) the
policyholder will lose the time value of money because they have to
wait till the end of the policy term (agreed in the beginning of
the contract) in order to receive the paid-up monies without any
interest factor.', 

', Also, even if the policy is surrendered, the policyholder will
lose a significant amount in the way of surrender charges.', 

', Insurer', 

', u"Lapsation of life insurance policies is a curse for the insurer
and a serious disease within an insurance company - which, if not
cured, could even lead to the whole company's bankruptcy. ", 

', Insurance companies function through the concept of risk pooling
and risk sharing. This means that the losses of the few are spread
over the group; average loss is substituted for actual loss.', 

', Whether this system functions successfully is dependent on the
concept of "the law of large numbers", which states that the
greater the number of exposures, the more likely the actual results
will approach the expected results. The law of large numbers
permits an insurer to estimate future losses with some
accuracy. ', 

', u"Lapsation of policies makes it difficult for insurance companies
to construct accurate estimates. Lapsed policies have a detrimental
effect on risk pooling and sharing - so, if policies start lapsing
then business is sure to deteriorate. Lapsation impacts on customer
retention, product performance, pricing factors, public image and
workforce planning, and is ultimately detrimental to the insurer's
business.", 

', Customer retention', 

', Lapses may be the source of customer dissatisfaction.
Satisfied customers generally want to continue to do business with
the company. Customer retention is a key profit driver for any
business organisation, and especially for an insurance company.
Repeat custom is much cheaper and nore profitable than attracting
new customers.', 

', Product performance', 

', Product performance and the solvency of any organisation
within a competitive market is entirely dependent on the
persistency of the business.', 

', The life insurance industry uses persistency (in other
words, the measure of how long a policy or a block of policies
remains in force) to monitor its marketing and service quality. The
higher the persistency rate (that is, the number of policies in
force at the end of a given year, divided by the number of polices
in force at the beginning of that year) the higher the product
performance.', 

', Moreover, persistency directly affects profitability
because policies which have been in force for a long time are more
profitable for insurers than policies which lapse quickly. If
premiums are being paid, the policy stays on the books. The longer
a policy remains on the books, the greater the likelihood is that
it will fill the need it was sold to cover.', 

', Pricing factors', 

', Insurance pricing depends on estimations as to the net
rate of investment yield, management expenses and mortality
selection. The impact of lapsation on these factors is mentioned
below:', 

', 
', Investment yield:', 
', 

', The insurer may lose planned investment cash flows; this
may result in forced investment sales (at a loss) in order to meet
surrender demands.', 

', 
', Management expenses:', 
', 

', Insurance companies tend to make profit out of premium
received after three years of a policy have completed. This is due
to the fact that the first year of a policy is very expensive for
the insurance company, compared with the premium taken in the first
year. It is a known fact that the insurer has to spend very heavily
in the initial years in order to procure a policy - in other words,
"new business strain". ', 

', u"It is a near-universal practice for life insurance
companies to pay a high rate of commission to their sales personnel
in the first year of the contract. The commission and bonus paid on
such policies becomes an undeserving benefit which is conferred on
the agents and officers involved. It leads to a financial burden on
the industry. Other than this, a policy's first-year expenses
include stamp duty, postage, fixed costs and administration costs
(that is, salaries to administrative employees like underwriters,
managers, supporting staff engaged in processing new business)
establishment expenses, and advertising costs.  ", 

', However, premium rates are determined at a uniform rate
("level premium") throughout a contract period, which may be as
long as thirty-five years or as short as two to five years. More
often than not, a policy term averages around twenty to twenty-five
years.', 
', 

', In this level-premium system, the assumed "expense
loading" ',  ', which is deemed to be a
factor',  ', (that is, amount needed to pay all
expenses, including commissions, general administrative expenses,
state premium taxes, acquisition expenses, and an allowance for
contingencies and
profit)',  is',  taken into account
when calculating premium rates and is spread over the entire term
of the policy. (Four factors are involved in the calculation of
life insurance premiums: the probability of the insured event
occurring; the time value of money; loadings to cover expenses,
taxes, profits, and contingencies; and the benefits
promised.)', 

', The high initial cost incurred when issuing a policy is
expected to be recovered through premium installments, paid over a
number of years (generally, from three to five years). If the
policies lapse soon after they are issued, the insurer has no way
to recover those expenses. Such lapses lead to a rise in first-year
premium to expense ratios, which leads to a fall in profitability
for the insurer. This then either leads to a fall in bonus rates
for all policyholders, or else the cost is pass on to persisting
policy owners - thereby raising their costs. This again leads to
further lapsation as the remaining policyholders may be
dissatisfied with rising costs or falling profits - and so the
vicious cycle continues.', 

', 
', Mortality or morbidity adverse selection:', 
', 

', In general, insureds who have adverse health or other
insurability problems tend not to lapse, causing the insurer to
experience a greater proportion of claims than expected if the
lapse rate is high. ', Thus, lapses can negatively affect
each of the three major pricing factors such as expenses,
investments and mortality and morbidity adverse
selection.', 

', 
', Detrimental effect on public image:', 
', 

', u"The insurance company suffers the loss of public image through
adverse publicity. This is namely because a lapsed policyholder
will seldom speak well of the insurance company with which they
were insured. The policyholder's ego is hurt.", 

', In particular, wherever lapsation is in large numbers, the
social sentiment as regards insurance is adversely affected. There
is a loss of goodwill among policyholders, as they view the
premiums paid as being lost to or forfeited by the insurance
company. While the results of lapsation may be perfectly justified
as regards legal, contractual and actuarial principles,
policyholders may still view their loss as money swindled from them
by the insurance company.', 

', 
', Workforce planning:', 
', 

', u"Policy lapsation even hampers insurance companies' ability to do
proper workforce planning, as they cannot accurately evaluate the
number of administrative staff needed to process proposals and
undertake any further processing or policy servicing. An insurance
company needs to have a clear idea of the number of proposals to be
processed in order to estimate the number of people who will be
needed to complete them into policies.", 

', u"The incidence of lapsation would render employees'
administrative efforts as useless. Policy lapsation would make it
appear as if an insurance company is overstaffed, since the figure
for employee salaries would be high (including that of any
employees needed to process the lapsable policies) compared with
the premiums being taken in, as premiums would not be collected on
lapsed policies. Lapsation is therefore an anti-employee
phenomenon.", 

', 
', u"Detrimental to the insurer's business:", 
', 

', Apart from the above-mentioned direct losses, the unproductive
efforts involved in the administration of lapsed policies will mean
the company may need to forego opportunities to generate genuine
business. The organisational goals and objectives stand defeated,
leading (in extreme cases) to the insurance company failing. A
failed insurance company is a great loss, one which will have the
following effects:', 

', 
', Too many policyholders (who will not get their premiums
back in full) leave aside the sum assured.', 

', u"The insurance company's employees are firstly retrenched
to reduce costs. Should the company fail, all are made
redundant.", 

', If the company is a nationalised one, large-scale
lapsation will mean that the Central Government loses revenue.
Ultimately, the government recovers its losses through heavier
taxation. ', 
', 

', u"A lapsed life insurance policy has an overall detrimental effect
on the insurer's business. This is particularly true when the
policy lapses within one or two years of taking the policy.
Therefore, it is imperative that the insurer controls lapsation
from the very beginning.", 

', Intermediaries', 

', u"The negative effect of lapsation not only affects the main
parties of the contract, but intermediaries also. Intermediaries
(including agents, branch-marketing supervisors, branch managers
and assistant branch managers) will have worked hard to bring the
policyholders to the insurance company's books; an effort which
lapsation renders futile. ", 

', Again, these unproductive efforts take up time that could be
spent on opportunities to generate genuine business. In addition,
insurance agents will also lose commision on policies which have
lapsed. Even development officers pay a price, as first-year
lapsation also hits their incentive bonuses.', 

', Economy', 

', u"Lapsation can cause far-reaching losses to society as a whole.
The insurance sector is the sole investor in almost every field
where investment for building infrastructure is required. Banks,
insurance companies and stock markets are the three avenues through
which most people tend to invest. This money is used for
nation-building and contributes to the nation's economy.", 

', u"Elements of nation-building include the construction of
large dams, roads, public hospitals etc. Hence, it can be safely
said that insurance money is used for generating employment,
raising the standard of living and improving people's welfare.
Policy lapsation can cause a serious investment miscalculation,
leading to a drag on the economic policy of a country and putting
the future of nation-building and the country's progress at
stake.", 

', Society', 

', Lapsation reduces the financial security of individuals. The
presence of uninsured risk as a consequence of lapsation may lead
to certain undesirable social and economic effects.', 

', In addition, a severe burden of the risk caused by lapsation is
worry and fear, leading to mental unrest.', 

', Moreover, dependence on public assistance or welfare or
financial assistance from relatives and friends would of necessity
increase in the case of uninsured loss occurrence.', 

', Government', 

', The lapsation of life insurance policies increases pressure on
the social welfare system in many states. It is a disadvantage in
the context of public finance and the growing financial
difficulties of pension systems is a burden the Government has to
bear.', 

', Considering the importance of insurance as a risk management
tool, the present day magnitude of lapsation in both public and
private sector companies and the impact of lapsation on all parties
necessitates the need for study as to the causes and costs of
lapsation in order to assist better policy making.', 

', Trends in the lapsation of life
insurance policies in India since 1951', 

', Since 1951, India has witnessed a full circle; from being an
open competitive market, to a nationalised one, and now back to the
liberalised regime.', 

', In 1956, 245 Indian and foreign insurers and provident societies
that were then operating in India were nationalised, and the Life
Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) was formed by an Act of
Parliament (Life Insurance Corporation Act, 1956).', 

', Before nationalisation, most leading insurance companies
experienced 30 to 50% lapsation rates within the first three years.
', Table 1',  shows the lapse rates of some of the
leading Indian insurance companies before nationalisation. As
indicated in the Ganesan Committee report (constructed in 1995
following a debate in Parliament regarding fake and bogus
policies) the average lapsation figures for all Indian
insurers prior to nationalisation was about 27-36%.', 

', According to the LIC, lapsation rates since nationalisation have
been 26 to 36% in the first 3 years. ', Table 2', u"
shows the percentage of net lapses from LIC's new business, from
1959 to 2000.", 

', The first premium lapse ratio of new LIC business has never been
less than 14%, except in the period 1969-70 when it was 13.92%. On
average, 18% of first premium lapsation was common for LIC
business, up until the opening of the sector in 2000, after which
the lapse rates of LIC have increased, even reaching 39.91% during
2005-06.', 

', Table 3',  shows the percentage of first-year
lapses of new LIC business from 1959 to 2008. ', 

', On average, it used to be common to have 6.6% net lapses to mean
life insurance business in force. ', Table 4', 
shows the percentage of net lapses to mean LIC life insurance
business in force since 1959.', 

', The lapsation ratio of non-linked business (term, group, health
and endowment plans) for Birla Sun Life Insurance Co Ltd was as
high as 72% for FY11. ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co ltd is
next, with 46% lapsation.', 

', u"Though the lapsation ratio for these two companies improved in
FY12, some companies' lapsation rate is doubled, compared to FY11.
The percentage of lapsation of all the companies for FY 12 is shown
in ", figure 1', .', 

', Costs of lapsation of life insurance
policies - a decade before and a decade after opening of the
sector', 

', The cost of the lapsation of life insurance policies can be
assessed in terms of lost benefit and lost opportunity.', 

', Lost benefit is calculated on the basis of the premium lost due
to lapsation. Lost opportunity is calculated on the basis of the
return which is foregone on the expected investments due to the
lapsation of policies. The following figures (Padmavathi, 2009)
apply to the state of the industry a decade before the opening of
the sector (that is, LIC figures from 1991-92 to 2000-01.)', 

', 
', 20,905,131.05 (2.10 crore) policies lapsed in this period.', 

', The loss of premium income for each policy year during this
decade is Rs 62,880,169,746 (Rs 6288.02 crore).', 

', Total loss of premium income (by assuming the average age of a
life insurance policy) over 20 years is Rs 1,257,603,394,924
(1,25,760.34 crore).', 

', The total amount of irrecoverable expenses due to the lapsation
of life insurance policies over a decade is Rs 53,448,144,284
(5344.81 crore).', 

', The indirect loss (arising due to the lost opportunity of
returns from investment, at 2% conservative rate) is Rs 5690.72
crore. This figure is the accumulated value of lost opportunity
within LIC business for a decade.', 

', The combined amount of irrecoverable expenses and the
accumulated value of lost opportunity from investments within LIC
business for a decade is Rs 11,035.53 crore. This is the reduced
distributable surplus (either to the policy holders or to the
shareholders.) It is because in actuarial valuation, the
irrecoverable expenses bring down the surplus; this, in turn,
reduces the bonus for existing with-profit policyholders and
increases the gross premium for future policyholders.', 

', The total surplus of LIC business for a decade is reduced by Rs
28,932.46 crore, taking into account the sum insured by lapsed
policies before acquiring paid-up value.', 
', 

', Table

caused by the lapsation of life insurance policies.', 

', Table 9',  shows the results of a study on
the lost opportunity in terms of irrecoverable expenses, as well as
the accumulated value of present lost opportunity to the insurance
industry due to the lapsation of life insurance policies.', 

', The combined amount of irrecoverable expenses and the
accumulated value of lost opportunity from investment for the
industry for a decade amounts to Rs 384,234.7 crore. This is the
reduced distributable surplus, either to the policy holders or to
the shareholders.', 

', A pilot study on the reasons behind the
lapsation of life insurance policies', 

', This thesis analyses the reasons behind the lapsation of life
insurance policies. The study is based on the perceptions of LIC
functionaries (branch managers, development officers and agents)
and policyholders. The figures were gathered from responses to
questionaires issued to 20 branch managers, 196 development
officers, 216 agents, and 640 policyholders in Hyderabad,
India.', 

', Responses to the questionaires identified several product design
factors which cause lapsation, namely; ', 

', 
', type of plan;', 

', sum assured;', 

', mode of premium payment; and/or', 

', Structure of services of agents.', 
', 

', Around 50% of respondents were of the opinion that the highest
lapsation rates come from endowment and money-back plans, when
compared with other plans.', 

', Around 75% felt that the majority of lapsed policies are from
policies with less than Rs 100,000 sum assured.  Around 70%
were of the opinion that a monthly payment mode for policyholders
is a major factor in lapsation rates.', 

', Around 75% of the total respondents were of the opinion that
part-time agent services is a contributory factor, with around 75%
feeling that instances of lapsation occured most often in the first
year after commencement of the policy.', 

', u"When comparing the results of the survey, with the help of rank
correlation it is shown that branch managers and agents'
perceptions regarding the type of insurance plan and sum assured
are similar, as the coefficient of correlation is 1. With respect
to the mode of premium payment, it is positive, as the coefficient
of correlation stands at 0.4. With respect to year of lapsation
after commencement of the policy, it is positive as the coefficient
of correlation stands at 0.5.", 

', On enquiry, the following observations were made: ', 

', 
', The LIC insists that an agent should cover 12 lives in an
agency year. As a result, to meet this target it is understood that
agents often resort to selling fake or bogus low sum assured
policies. This trend can be interpreted as "forced selling", in
order to meet business targets.', 

', To please an agent who is a friend or relative, people might
take a low sum assured policy without having any real need for
insurance or with no intention of continuing the policy in
future.', 

', The practice of rebating (where the agent pays the first
premium to the policyholder) is a factor, as a policyholder may
perhaps not continue the future premium payments due to ignorance
or disinterest.', 

', In general, with sum assured policies the attention is focused
on the maturity benefit rather than the risk cover. As such,
maturity benefit fails to sufficiently motivate the policyholder in
the context of rising prices. This may then prompt the policyholder
to lapse the policy.', 

', Annual payments mode occurs mostly in very high income groups,
as the premium amount is high. For this reason, the problem of
lapsation is often minimal. Quarterly and half-yearly mode of
payment occurs mostly in middle-income groups. Middle-income groups
mostly incur their expenditure based on their budget plan.', 

', For salary saving schemes, there is a requirement to pay two
premiums at the beginning of the policy; whereas in the monthly
premiums payment mode, payments can be made either by cash or via
electronic clearing system (ECS) on standing instructions. There is
then a requirement to pay three premiums. Agents who are striving
to meet the minimum target of 12 insurance policies in every year
can get involved in bogus selling or programmed lapses; this is
done by paying two premiums via salary saving schemes, with the
intentions of lapsing the policy in future.', 

', Change of address, change of job, and transfers also can
contribute to lapsation rates that are paid monthly.', 

', It is noticed that most of the agents in this survey were
involved in agency work on a part-time basis. Part-time involvement
of agent services occurs when the agent treats insurance selling
work as a secondary activity - while primarily engaged as a
student, professional or salaried employee or as a self-employed
worker. As a consequence, the agent is unable to spare much time
with which to serve the customer. This can be interpreted as lack
of proper after-sales service, which may lead to the lapsation of
policies. There are no threats or disincentives levied on the
marketing force for policies that have lapsed.', 
', 

', Causes of lapsation: statistical analysis', 

', Factors behind the lapsation of life insurance policies are
classified as follows:', 

', 
', u"the customer's level of awareness (regarding personal risks,
insurance and insurance product knowledge);", 

', product mismatch (lack of need-based selling/forced
selling/wrong selling);',

risk coverage has been neglected by these policyholders.', 

', Suggestions', 

', Below are some suggested ways by which to reduce the lapsation
of life insurance policies, based on the results of this survey.
The suggestions are divided by survey participant.', 

', Branch managers', 

', 85% of the branch managers in the survey suggested that agents
should be required to undertake training programs in order to
improve their skills in the art of selling insurance and serving
policyholders.', 

', u"They also suggested that persistency factors be included in the
agents' incentive structure as well as the introduction of special
revival schemes to reduce lapsation levels.", 

', Agents', 

', The majority of the agents surveyed suggested that there should
be adequate support from the insurer in order to minimise the
lapsation of insurance policies.', 

', It has been shown that variable, irregular monthly income (with
a lack of guaranteed or minimum guaranteed monthly income) is a
major de-motivating factor for the agents when following up
policies which have already been marketed.', 

', Policyholders', 

', 36.3% of policyholders expected reminders from the company.
58.8% of the policyholders expect concessions in arrear payments
and reduction in interest payments.', 

', If lapses are to be tackled effectively, specific solutions to
each problem are presented below. Though most of the companies are
aware of these solutions, their main focus is on the aggressive
selling of new business than aggressive retention of existing
business.', 

', Lapsation of endowment plans', 

', When selling insurance policies, benefits would be gained
through highlighting the economic value of the life of a
breadwinner to their dependants, and associated appropriate risk
coverage.', 

', Insurance companies, regulatory authorities, the Government and
educational institutions should work to create awareness regarding
the concept of insurance. They should also educate the public about
the features and purpose of insurance products. This would reduce
instances of lapsation caused by product mismatching.', 

', Low sum assured policies', 

', Some of the solutions benefiting the problem of lapsation in low
sum assured policies are:', 

', 
', easing out of corporation targets;', 

', u"performing a proper assessment of the economic value of the
prospective customer's life and the appropriate level of
coverage; ", 

', strict legal actions on the practices of rebating; and', 

', taking inflation into consideration of inflation when
suggesting the sum assured.', 
', 

', Monthly payment policies', 

', Increasing the premium payment channels as well as consumer
awareness about these channels would be helpful in order to reduce
lapsation with the problem of mode of payment.', 

', Lapsation in the first year after commencement', 

', u"The suggested product should meet the customer's requirements.
The product features and the terms and conditions should be
properly explained to the customer and understood by the
customer.", 

', u"The amount of premium/sum assured should be reasonable in
relation to the policyholder's means, and the business should be to
fulfill a genuine need and not merely to achieve targets or fulfill
the conditions for incentive schemes.", 

', Intermediaries should receive training in how to understand the
customer and their needs.', 

', Part-time intermediaries', 

', In order to raise the professionalism of an insurance
intermendiary, ongoing training by the IRDA, insurance companies
and educational institutions is required.', 

', Charge-back commissions and a levelled commission structure can
lead to efficient aftersales service.', 

', In addition to using traditional channels and methods to
communicate and deliver of service to policyholders, the latest
information technology can be used to create many more touch points
by which to provide information, respond to queries, resolve
problems, send reminders and facilitate transactions.', 

', Companies need to improve their service delivery initiatives;
policyholders should be able to use web services for premium
payment and document submission. They should be able to receive
cell phone alerts for premium dues, make payments through SMS,
access company databases through toll-free numbers and IVRS
(Interactive Voice Response System). Online chats and e-mail
notifications about important dates and customer service request
responses would also be a valuable service.', 

', In addition, companies can set up Business Conservation Units
(BCU) to implement retention strategies.', 

', u"Customer's financial problems and competition with other
financial institutions or instruments", 

', u"The agent is the primary underwriter, and has to understand the
customer's financial capabilities, in both current as well as
future projects.", 

', u"These must be factored in before deciding/suggesting an optimum
policy or product to the customer. The underwriting cost and
product size (that is, the sum assured/premium) which the customer
has to pay should be a major focus. An agent will have to
thoroughly evaluate the customer's economic status.", 

', The study indicates that there is no proper financial planning
for lapsed policyholders. The process of proper financial planning
starts with risk coverage, followed by savings, retirement needs
and investments.', 

', Insurers need to recognize that insurance is a unique financial
instrument which replaces the actual loss - which no other
financial instrument does. Hence insurers should prioritise
adequate risk coverage for the prospective customer, before
addressing savings or investments. If savings/investments are
prioritised, the probability that the policy will lapse is higher,
likely occurring as and when better alternatives emerge.', 

', u"Insurers have to emphasise need-based selling by understanding
the social behaviour of the proposed customer. They have to provide
high-quality customer service which is responsive to the
policyholder's requests. Then, competition with other financial
instruments and institutions will not become the cause behind the
lapsation of life insurance policies.", 

', In addition, flexible products, product switching, premium
holidays and reduced coverage can be offered to customers who
intend to continue with their policy but who (due to unforeseen
circumstances or sudden financial constraints) are unable to pay
their premiums.', 

', u"Customer's socio-economic background", 

', Awareness has to be created among younger age groups regarding
the importance of financial planning from the the first day they
begin earning. They should be educated as to the role of insurance
as a primary risk management tool in their financial planning.', 

', u"Life insurance companies should collect data of all withdrawals
and analyse their experience on regular basis to monitor
performance and control the sales outlets. Special incentives for
revival of lapsed orphan policies can be provided apart from giving
producers a share of commissions.An investor guide, life insurance
buyer's guide can be published and circulated. Customer service
camps can be conducted to explain their privileges, product
features, claims processing, grievance reddressal machinery and
several other policy servicing aspects. Increasing customer
sophistication and product disclosures can directly assist in
retention of business.", 

', While it is to be acknowledged that not one of the above
suggestions may be very effective in isolation in countering the
situation, the combined effect of all aspects taken together may
promise to be significant and yield results. ', 

', Conclusion', 

', u"The cost of lapsation is a waste and a drag on a life insurance
company's income and life fund. It reduces the profitability and
distributable surplus.", 

', u"The retention of existing business on the insurers' books is as
important, if not more important, as procuring new business.
Further income from an existing policy that has run for some years
is much more stable and therefore more certain to be realised for a
long time in the future.", 

', u"The adverse effect of lapsation and the subsequent decline in
bonus rates has very serious consequences on goodwill of the
industry. Insurance functionaries' efforts go to waste, although
the level of loss can never be correctly estimated and any
unscrupulous activities are not exposed to vigilance management
systems.", 

', Ultimately, lapsation benefits no-one. It is true that paying
premiums or continuing the policies are in the hands of the
policyholder. Still if a company can reduce the lapse rate through
their conservation efforts, all parties of a policy stand to
gain.', 

', u"The highly critical nature of this subject and its effect on
life insurance companies is now perhaps even more significant in
today's competitive life insurance sector. Hence, life insurers
should contemplate and initiate all possible steps in order to
ensure that lapsation, if it cannot be totally negated, is at least
kept at the minimum possible levels. Perhaps any cost paid for this
is worth it.", 

', So, the life insurance industry needs to pay attention not only
to procuring new business but also to preventing the lapsation or
surrender of old policies, improving the conservation of existing
business and thereby improving productivity and profitability.', 

', The study of lapsation helps companies to develop new products
and monitor marketing and product performance. The present study
can be extended further to the following other areas.', 

', 
', the impact of lapsation on the profitability of an insurance
company;', 

', the impact of lapsation on the pricing of an insurance
company;', 

', the impact of lapsation on the management expenses;', 

', causes of persistency in life insurance policies; and', 

', the use of expected lapse rates in the classification of life
insurance applicants. ',

', Introduction', 

', In India, the term "lapsation" is not directly defined in the
Insurance Act 1938. The Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC)
states that a policy is treated as lapsed if the premium is not
paid within 6 months from the due date.', 

', (It has to be noted that, if a policy has lapsed, the insurer is
obliged to pay back the amount to the policyholder only when it has
"paid-up value".)', 

', Permanent policies acquire paid-up value when premiums under the
policy have been paid for at least three years. The paid-up value
will be proportionate to the sum assured in the same proportion as
the number of premiums paid bears to the total number of premiums
originally payable as per the contract. This paid value is payable
on the maturity date or on the death of the life assured, should
this take place earlier.', 

', The policyholder also has a right to surrender their policy
without waiting for the maturity date, but they would receive a
certain percentage of the paid-up value - the "surrender
value". If the policy lapses before 3 years have passed, the
insurer is not obliged to pay back any amount to the
policyholder.', 

', The last few years have seen regulatory upheavals within the
Indian insurance industry. These changes have seen the industry
change the available product mix in favour of higher-cost
products.', 

', From the opening of the sector until till 2009, around
80% of the industry was made up of unit-linked insurance plans
(ULIPs). However, once the 2010 ULIP guidelines capped costs to an
effective 2.25% over the life of the policy (over a 15-year
period), life companies started showing an interest in producing
and selling more "traditional" plans, in which first-year
commissions can still go as high as 35-40%.', 

', Traditional plans have been growing and now constitute at least
half of life insurance business, whereas ULIPs are facing a
negative growth. Insurers and sellers like traditional plans,
because the seller gets up to 40% of the premium as commission in
the first year and the insurer usually gets to keep the entire
premium if the policyholder lapses the policy (the maximum hit for
customers on a ULIPs policy is now Rs 6,000, instead of the whole
premium).', 

', The life insurance business now functions by hitting customers
with a high-cost product and allowing it to lapse in the first
three years of the policy. Recent reports have clearly shown that,
for some insurance companies, lapsation has become a profitable
tool. A March 2012 Goldman Sachs report shows that, for 2010-11,
the lapsed profits for various companies stood as follows:', 

', 
', ICICI Prudential Life: Rs 730 crore; ', 

', Bajaj Allianz: Rs 367 crore;', 

', HDFC Standard Life Insurance Co. Ltd: Rs 223
crore;', 

', Max New York Life: Rs 184 crore. ', 
', 

', However these profits are short-lived; the report estimates that
the gains from lapsed profit will disappear by the first half of FY
2013 and the pool of profits from lapsed policies will gradually
fade away.', 

', In the long term, companies will need to focus on persistency,
which is a key indicator of an insurer's health. Typically, an
insurer incurs significant acquisition costs in the beginning. It
takes about three to seven years to achieve break-even on a policy.
Bonuses earned by participating plans depend on three factors -
costs, mortality and persistency - and insurance companies with
"leaky buckets" or high lapse ratios will find it progressively
difficult to offer competitive bonus rates.', 

', Though insurers may still be receiving a chunk of profits from
lapsed policies, they will have to look for other ways to sustain
these profits, since lapsed profits are short-lived.  Lapsed
policies show market immaturity - that is, they indicate that
product manufacturers and buyers are still figuring out the right
product mix. In developed markets such as the US and the UK, the
lapsation ratio is less than 10%; in Asian markets it is around
15-20%. However, in India it is more than 20% on average, and
within certain companies it is more than 50%.', 

', In this context, this document focuses on the impact and costs
of - as well as the reasons behind - the lapsation of life
insurance policies. ', 

', Impact of the lapsation of life
insurance policies', 

', Other than fake or bogus policies (defined as "a non-genuine
life insurance contract completed with ulterior motives on the
basis of proposal on the life of a non-existent proposer or on the
life of an existing proposer without his knowledge and/or consent
which are issued by agents, officers, and other personnel and
sometimes in connivance with medical practitioners") the issue
of lapsation of life insurance policies is at a magnitude which
affects not only the policyholder, but also the insurer,
intermediaries, the Indian Government, economy and society as a
whole.', 

', The impact on every concerned party is mentioned below.', 

', Policyholder', 

', If a life insurance policy is taken out to cover the risk of the
life of an insured, with the lapsation of the policy the coverage
of such risk ceases. With such a cessation the immediate family
becomes insecure and at a loss.', 

', Apart from losing the family protection, the policyholder also
loses a portion of the savings - most likely accumulated with
considerable effort over a period of time. The loss is
disproportionately high in the initial stages because of how level
premium systems work. The insured would also be losing the benefit
of returns from alternate investments elsewhere.', 

', The fundamental idea behind a level premium plan is that an
insurance company can accept the same premium each year, provided
that the level premiums collected are the mathematical equivalent
of the corresponding single premium.', 

', As a result, level premiums paid in the early years of the
contract will be more than sufficient to pay current death claims,
but will be less than adequate to meet death claims that occur in
later years. Life insurance is, thus far, one of the first products
marketed on the installment plan.', 

', Even if the policy is made "paid up" (see above) the
policyholder will lose the time value of money because they have to
wait till the end of the policy term (agreed in the beginning of
the contract) in order to receive the paid-up monies without any
interest factor.', 

', Also, even if the policy is surrendered, the policyholder will
lose a significant amount in the way of surrender charges.', 

', Insurer', 

', u"Lapsation of life insurance policies is a curse for the insurer
and a serious disease within an insurance company - which, if not
cured, could even lead to the whole company's bankruptcy. ", 

', Insurance companies function through the concept of risk pooling
and risk sharing. This means that the losses of the few are spread
over the group; average loss is substituted for actual loss.', 

', Whether this system functions successfully is dependent on the
concept of "the law of large numbers", which states that the
greater the number of exposures, the more likely the actual results
will approach the expected results. The law of large numbers
permits an insurer to estimate future losses with some
accuracy. ', 

', u"Lapsation of policies makes it difficult for insurance companies
to construct accurate estimates. Lapsed policies have a detrimental
effect on risk pooling and sharing - so, if policies start lapsing
then business is sure to deteriorate. Lapsation impacts on customer
retention, product performance, pricing factors, public image and
workforce planning, and is ultimately detrimental to the insurer's
business.", 

', Customer retention', 

', Lapses may be the source of customer dissatisfaction.
Satisfied customers generally want to continue to do business with
the company. Customer retention is a key profit driver for any
business organisation, and especially for an insurance company.
Repeat custom is much cheaper and nore profitable than attracting
new customers.', 

', Product performance', 

', Product performance and the solvency of any organisation
within a competitive market is entirely dependent on the
persistency of the business.', 

', The life insurance industry uses persistency (in other
words, the measure of how long a policy or a block of policies
remains in force) to monitor its marketing and service quality. The
higher the persistency rate (that is, the number of policies in
force at the end of a given year, divided by the number of polices
in force at the beginning of that year) the higher the product
performance.', 

', Moreover, persistency directly affects profitability
because policies which have been in force for a long time are more
profitable for insurers than policies which lapse quickly. If
premiums are being paid, the policy stays on the books. The longer
a policy remains on the books, the greater the likelihood is that
it will fill the need it was sold to cover.', 

', Pricing factors', 

', Insurance pricing depends on estimations as to the net
rate of investment yield, management expenses and mortality
selection. The impact of lapsation on these factors is mentioned
below:', 

', 
', Investment yield:', 
', 

', The insurer may lose planned investment cash flows; this
may result in forced investment sales (at a loss) in order to meet
surrender demands.', 

', 
', Management expenses:', 
', 

', Insurance companies tend to make profit out of premium
received after three years of a policy have completed. This is due
to the fact that the first year of a policy is very expensive for
the insurance company, compared with the premium taken in the first
year. It is a known fact that the insurer has to spend very heavily
in the initial years in order to procure a policy - in other words,
"new business strain". ', 

', u"It is a near-universal practice for life insurance
companies to pay a high rate of commission to their sales personnel
in the first year of the contract. The commission and bonus paid on
such policies becomes an undeserving benefit which is conferred on
the agents and officers involved. It leads to a financial burden on
the industry. Other than this, a policy's first-year expenses
include stamp duty, postage, fixed costs and administration costs
(that is, salaries to administrative employees like underwriters,
managers, supporting staff engaged in processing new business)
establishment expenses, and advertising costs.  ", 

', However, premium rates are determined at a uniform rate
("level premium") throughout a contract period, which may be as
long as thirty-five years or as short as two to five years. More
often than not, a policy term averages around twenty to twenty-five
years.', 
', 

', In this level-premium system, the assumed "expense
loading" ',  ', which is deemed to be a
factor',  ', (that is, amount needed to pay all
expenses, including commissions, general administrative expenses,
state premium taxes, acquisition expenses, and an allowance for
contingencies and
profit)',  is',  taken into account
when calculating premium rates and is spread over the entire term
of the policy. (Four factors are involved in the calculation of
life insurance premiums: the probability of the insured event
occurring; the time value of money; loadings to cover expenses,
taxes, profits, and contingencies; and the benefits
promised.)', 

', The high initial cost incurred when issuing a policy is
expected to be recovered through premium installments, paid over a
number of years (generally, from three to five years). If the
policies lapse soon after they are issued, the insurer has no way
to recover those expenses. Such lapses lead to a rise in first-year
premium to expense ratios, which leads to a fall in profitability
for the insurer. This then either leads to a fall in bonus rates
for all policyholders, or else the cost is pass on to persisting
policy owners - thereby raising their costs. This again leads to
further lapsation as the remaining policyholders may be
dissatisfied with rising costs or falling profits - and so the
vicious cycle continues.', 

', 
', Mortality or morbidity adverse selection:', 
', 

', In general, insureds who have adverse health or other
insurability problems tend not to lapse, causing the insurer to
experience a greater proportion of claims than expected if the
lapse rate is high. ', Thus, lapses can negatively affect
each of the three major pricing factors such as expenses,
investments and mortality and morbidity adverse
selection.', 

', 
', Detrimental effect on public image:', 
', 

', u"The insurance company suffers the loss of public image through
adverse publicity. This is namely because a lapsed policyholder
will seldom speak well of the insurance company with which they
were insured. The policyholder's ego is hurt.", 

', In particular, wherever lapsation is in large numbers, the
social sentiment as regards insurance is adversely affected. There
is a loss of goodwill among policyholders, as they view the
premiums paid as being lost to or forfeited by the insurance
company. While the results of lapsation may be perfectly justified
as regards legal, contractual and actuarial principles,
policyholders may still view their loss as money swindled from them
by the insurance company.', 

', 
', Workforce planning:', 
', 

', u"Policy lapsation even hampers insurance companies' ability to do
proper workforce planning, as they cannot accurately evaluate the
number of administrative staff needed to process proposals and
undertake any further processing or policy servicing. An insurance
company needs to have a clear idea of the number of proposals to be
processed in order to estimate the number of people who will be
needed to complete them into policies.", 

', u"The incidence of lapsation would render employees'
administrative efforts as useless. Policy lapsation would make it
appear as if an insurance company is overstaffed, since the figure
for employee salaries would be high (including that of any
employees needed to process the lapsable policies) compared with
the premiums being taken in, as premiums would not be collected on
lapsed policies. Lapsation is therefore an anti-employee
phenomenon.", 

', 
', u"Detrimental to the insurer's business:", 
', 

', Apart from the above-mentioned direct losses, the unproductive
efforts involved in the administration of lapsed policies will mean
the company may need to forego opportunities to generate genuine
business. The organisational goals and objectives stand defeated,
leading (in extreme cases) to the insurance company failing. A
failed insurance company is a great loss, one which will have the
following effects:', 

', 
', Too many policyholders (who will not get their premiums
back in full) leave aside the sum assured.', 

', u"The insurance company's employees are firstly retrenched
to reduce costs. Should the company fail, all are made
redundant.", 

', If the company is a nationalised one, large-scale
lapsation will mean that the Central Government loses revenue.
Ultimately, the government recovers its losses through heavier
taxation. ', 
', 

', u"A lapsed life insurance policy has an overall detrimental effect
on the insurer's business. This is particularly true when the
policy lapses within one or two years of taking the policy.
Therefore, it is imperative that the insurer controls lapsation
from the very beginning.", 

', Intermediaries', 

', u"The negative effect of lapsation not only affects the main
parties of the contract, but intermediaries also. Intermediaries
(including agents, branch-marketing supervisors, branch managers
and assistant branch managers) will have worked hard to bring the
policyholders to the insurance company's books; an effort which
lapsation renders futile. ", 

', Again, these unproductive efforts take up time that could be
spent on opportunities to generate genuine business. In addition,
insurance agents will also lose commision on policies which have
lapsed. Even development officers pay a price, as first-year
lapsation also hits their incentive bonuses.', 

', Economy', 

', u"Lapsation can cause far-reaching losses to society as a whole.
The insurance sector is the sole investor in almost every field
where investment for building infrastructure is required. Banks,
insurance companies and stock markets are the three avenues through
which most people tend to invest. This money is used for
nation-building and contributes to the nation's economy.", 

', u"Elements of nation-building include the construction of
large dams, roads, public hospitals etc. Hence, it can be safely
said that insurance money is used for generating employment,
raising the standard of living and improving people's welfare.
Policy lapsation can cause a serious investment miscalculation,
leading to a drag on the economic policy of a country and putting
the future of nation-building and the country's progress at
stake.", 

', Society', 

', Lapsation reduces the financial security of individuals. The
presence of uninsured risk as a consequence of lapsation may lead
to certain undesirable social and economic effects.', 

', In addition, a severe burden of the risk caused by lapsation is
worry and fear, leading to mental unrest.', 

', Moreover, dependence on public assistance or welfare or
financial assistance from relatives and friends would of necessity
increase in the case of uninsured loss occurrence.', 

', Government', 

', The lapsation of life insurance policies increases pressure on
the social welfare system in many states. It is a disadvantage in
the context of public finance and the growing financial
difficulties of pension systems is a burden the Government has to
bear.', 

', Considering the importance of insurance as a risk management
tool, the present day magnitude of lapsation in both public and
private sector companies and the impact of lapsation on all parties
necessitates the need for study as to the causes and costs of
lapsation in order to assist better policy making.', 

', Trends in the lapsation of life
insurance policies in India since 1951', 

', Since 1951, India has witnessed a full circle; from being an
open competitive market, to a nationalised one, and now back to the
liberalised regime.', 

', In 1956, 245 Indian and foreign insurers and provident societies
that were then operating in India were nationalised, and the Life
Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) was formed by an Act of
Parliament (Life Insurance Corporation Act, 1956).', 

', Before nationalisation, most leading insurance companies
experienced 30 to 50% lapsation rates within the first three years.
', Table 1',  shows the lapse rates of some of the
leading Indian insurance companies before nationalisation. As
indicated in the Ganesan Committee report (constructed in 1995
following a debate in Parliament regarding fake and bogus
policies) the average lapsation figures for all Indian
insurers prior to nationalisation was about 27-36%.', 

', According to the LIC, lapsation rates since nationalisation have
been 26 to 36% in the first 3 years. ', Table 2', u"
shows the percentage of net lapses from LIC's new business, from
1959 to 2000.", 

', The first premium lapse ratio of new LIC business has never been
less than 14%, except in the period 1969-70 when it was 13.92%. On
average, 18% of first premium lapsation was common for LIC
business, up until the opening of the sector in 2000, after which
the lapse rates of LIC have increased, even reaching 39.91% during
2005-06.', 

', Table 3',  shows the percentage of first-year
lapses of new LIC business from 1959 to 2008. ', 

', On average, it used to be common to have 6.6% net lapses to mean
life insurance business in force. ', Table 4', 
shows the percentage of net lapses to mean LIC life insurance
business in force since 1959.', 

', The lapsation ratio of non-linked business (term, group, health
and endowment plans) for Birla Sun Life Insurance Co Ltd was as
high as 72% for FY11. ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co ltd is
next, with 46% lapsation.', 

', u"Though the lapsation ratio for these two companies improved in
FY12, some companies' lapsation rate is doubled, compared to FY11.
The percentage of lapsation of all the companies for FY 12 is shown
in ", figure 1', .', 

', Costs of lapsation of life insurance
policies - a decade before and a decade after opening of the
sector', 

', The cost of the lapsation of life insurance policies can be
assessed in terms of lost benefit and lost opportunity.', 

', Lost benefit is calculated on the basis of the premium lost due
to lapsation. Lost opportunity is calculated on the basis of the
return which is foregone on the expected investments due to the
lapsation of policies. The following figures (Padmavathi, 2009)
apply to the state of the industry a decade before the opening of
the sector (that is, LIC figures from 1991-92 to 2000-01.)', 

', 
', 20,905,131.05 (2.10 crore) policies lapsed in this period.', 

', The loss of premium income for each policy year during this
decade is Rs 62,880,169,746 (Rs 6288.02 crore).', 

', Total loss of premium income (by assuming the average age of a
life insurance policy) over 20 years is Rs 1,257,603,394,924
(1,25,760.34 crore).', 

', The total amount of irrecoverable expenses due to the lapsation
of life insurance policies over a decade is Rs 53,448,144,284
(5344.81 crore).', 

', The indirect loss (arising due to the lost opportunity of
returns from investment, at 2% conservative rate) is Rs 5690.72
crore. This figure is the accumulated value of lost opportunity
within LIC business for a decade.', 

', The combined amount of irrecoverable expenses and the
accumulated value of lost opportunity from investments within LIC
business for a decade is Rs 11,035.53 crore. This is the reduced
distributable surplus (either to the policy holders or to the
shareholders.) It is because in actuarial valuation, the
irrecoverable expenses bring down the surplus; this, in turn,
reduces the bonus for existing with-profit policyholders and
increases the gross premium for future policyholders.', 

', The total surplus of LIC business for a decade is reduced by Rs
28,932.46 crore, taking into account the sum insured by lapsed
policies before acquiring paid-up value.', 
', 

', Table

caused by the lapsation of life insurance policies.', 

', Table 9',  shows the results of a study on
the lost opportunity in terms of irrecoverable expenses, as well as
the accumulated value of present lost opportunity to the insurance
industry due to the lapsation of life insurance policies.', 

', The combined amount of irrecoverable expenses and the
accumulated value of lost opportunity from investment for the
industry for a decade amounts to Rs 384,234.7 crore. This is the
reduced distributable surplus, either to the policy holders or to
the shareholders.', 

', A pilot study on the reasons behind the
lapsation of life insurance policies', 

', This thesis analyses the reasons behind the lapsation of life
insurance policies. The study is based on the perceptions of LIC
functionaries (branch managers, development officers and agents)
and policyholders. The figures were gathered from responses to
questionaires issued to 20 branch managers, 196 development
officers, 216 agents, and 640 policyholders in Hyderabad,
India.', 

', Responses to the questionaires identified several product design
factors which cause lapsation, namely; ', 

', 
', type of plan;', 

', sum assured;', 

', mode of premium payment; and/or', 

', Structure of services of agents.', 
', 

', Around 50% of respondents were of the opinion that the highest
lapsation rates come from endowment and money-back plans, when
compared with other plans.', 

', Around 75% felt that the majority of lapsed policies are from
policies with less than Rs 100,000 sum assured.  Around 70%
were of the opinion that a monthly payment mode for policyholders
is a major factor in lapsation rates.', 

', Around 75% of the total respondents were of the opinion that
part-time agent services is a contributory factor, with around 75%
feeling that instances of lapsation occured most often in the first
year after commencement of the policy.', 

', u"When comparing the results of the survey, with the help of rank
correlation it is shown that branch managers and agents'
perceptions regarding the type of insurance plan and sum assured
are similar, as the coefficient of correlation is 1. With respect
to the mode of premium payment, it is positive, as the coefficient
of correlation stands at 0.4. With respect to year of lapsation
after commencement of the policy, it is positive as the coefficient
of correlation stands at 0.5.", 

', On enquiry, the following observations were made: ', 

', 
', The LIC insists that an agent should cover 12 lives in an
agency year. As a result, to meet this target it is understood that
agents often resort to selling fake or bogus low sum assured
policies. This trend can be interpreted as "forced selling", in
order to meet business targets.', 

', To please an agent who is a friend or relative, people might
take a low sum assured policy without having any real need for
insurance or with no intention of continuing the policy in
future.', 

', The practice of rebating (where the agent pays the first
premium to the policyholder) is a factor, as a policyholder may
perhaps not continue the future premium payments due to ignorance
or disinterest.', 

', In general, with sum assured policies the attention is focused
on the maturity benefit rather than the risk cover. As such,
maturity benefit fails to sufficiently motivate the policyholder in
the context of rising prices. This may then prompt the policyholder
to lapse the policy.', 

', Annual payments mode occurs mostly in very high income groups,
as the premium amount is high. For this reason, the problem of
lapsation is often minimal. Quarterly and half-yearly mode of
payment occurs mostly in middle-income groups. Middle-income groups
mostly incur their expenditure based on their budget plan.', 

', For salary saving schemes, there is a requirement to pay two
premiums at the beginning of the policy; whereas in the monthly
premiums payment mode, payments can be made either by cash or via
electronic clearing system (ECS) on standing instructions. There is
then a requirement to pay three premiums. Agents who are striving
to meet the minimum target of 12 insurance policies in every year
can get involved in bogus selling or programmed lapses; this is
done by paying two premiums via salary saving schemes, with the
intentions of lapsing the policy in future.', 

', Change of address, change of job, and transfers also can
contribute to lapsation rates that are paid monthly.', 

', It is noticed that most of the agents in this survey were
involved in agency work on a part-time basis. Part-time involvement
of agent services occurs when the agent treats insurance selling
work as a secondary activity - while primarily engaged as a
student, professional or salaried employee or as a self-employed
worker. As a consequence, the agent is unable to spare much time
with which to serve the customer. This can be interpreted as lack
of proper after-sales service, which may lead to the lapsation of
policies. There are no threats or disincentives levied on the
marketing force for policies that have lapsed.', 
', 

', Causes of lapsation: statistical analysis', 

', Factors behind the lapsation of life insurance policies are
classified as follows:', 

', 
', u"the customer's level of awareness (regarding personal risks,
insurance and insurance product knowledge);", 

', product mismatch (lack of need-based selling/forced
selling/wrong selling);',

of awareness regarding risk coverage. ",

risk coverage has been neglected by these policyholders.', 

', Suggestions', 

', Below are some suggested ways by which to reduce the lapsation
of life insurance policies, based on the results of this survey.
The suggestions are divided by survey participant.', 

', Branch managers', 

', 85% of the branch managers in the survey suggested that agents
should be required to undertake training programs in order to
improve their skills in the art of selling insurance and serving
policyholders.', 

', u"They also suggested that persistency factors be included in the
agents' incentive structure as well as the introduction of special
revival schemes to reduce lapsation levels.", 

', Agents', 

', The majority of the agents surveyed suggested that there should
be adequate support from the insurer in order to minimise the
lapsation of insurance policies.', 

', It has been shown that variable, irregular monthly income (with
a lack of guaranteed or minimum guaranteed monthly income) is a
major de-motivating factor for the agents when following up
policies which have already been marketed.', 

', Policyholders', 

', 36.3% of policyholders expected reminders from the company.
58.8% of the policyholders expect concessions in arrear payments
and reduction in interest payments.', 

', If lapses are to be tackled effectively, specific solutions to
each problem are presented below. Though most of the companies are
aware of these solutions, their main focus is on the aggressive
selling of new business than aggressive retention of existing
business.', 

', Lapsation of endowment plans', 

', When selling insurance policies, benefits would be gained
through highlighting the economic value of the life of a
breadwinner to their dependants, and associated appropriate risk
coverage.', 

', Insurance companies, regulatory authorities, the Government and
educational institutions should work to create awareness regarding
the concept of insurance. They should also educate the public about
the features and purpose of insurance products. This would reduce
instances of lapsation caused by product mismatching.', 

', Low sum assured policies', 

', Some of the solutions benefiting the problem of lapsation in low
sum assured policies are:', 

', 
', easing out of corporation targets;', 

', u"performing a proper assessment of the economic value of the
prospective customer's life and the appropriate level of
coverage; ", 

', strict legal actions on the practices of rebating; and', 

', taking inflation into consideration of inflation when
suggesting the sum assured.', 
', 

', Monthly payment policies', 

', Increasing the premium payment channels as well as consumer
awareness about these channels would be helpful in order to reduce
lapsation with the problem of mode of payment.', 

', Lapsation in the first year after commencement', 

', u"The suggested product should meet the customer's requirements.
The product features and the terms and conditions should be
properly explained to the customer and understood by the
customer.", 

', u"The amount of premium/sum assured should be reasonable in
relation to the policyholder's means, and the business should be to
fulfill a genuine need and not merely to achieve targets or fulfill
the conditions for incentive schemes.", 

', Intermediaries should receive training in how to understand the
customer and their needs.', 

', Part-time intermediaries', 

', In order to raise the professionalism of an insurance
intermendiary, ongoing training by the IRDA, insurance companies
and educational institutions is required.', 

', Charge-back commissions and a levelled commission structure can
lead to efficient aftersales service.', 

', In addition to using traditional channels and methods to
communicate and deliver of service to policyholders, the latest
information technology can be used to create many more touch points
by which to provide information, respond to queries, resolve
problems, send reminders and facilitate transactions.', 

', Companies need to improve their service delivery initiatives;
policyholders should be able to use web services for premium
payment and document submission. They should be able to receive
cell phone alerts for premium dues, make payments through SMS,
access company databases through toll-free numbers and IVRS
(Interactive Voice Response System). Online chats and e-mail
notifications about important dates and customer service request
responses would also be a valuable service.', 

', In addition, companies can set up Business Conservation Units
(BCU) to implement retention strategies.', 

', u"Customer's financial problems and competition with other
financial institutions or instruments", 

', u"The agent is the primary underwriter, and has to understand the
customer's financial capabilities, in both current as well as
future projects.", 

', u"These must be factored in before deciding/suggesting an optimum
policy or product to the customer. The underwriting cost and
product size (that is, the sum assured/premium) which the customer
has to pay should be a major focus. An agent will have to
thoroughly evaluate the customer's economic status.", 

', The study indicates that there is no proper financial planning
for lapsed policyholders. The process of proper financial planning
starts with risk coverage, followed by savings, retirement needs
and investments.', 

', Insurers need to recognize that insurance is a unique financial
instrument which replaces the actual loss - which no other
financial instrument does. Hence insurers should prioritise
adequate risk coverage for the prospective customer, before
addressing savings or investments. If savings/investments are
prioritised, the probability that the policy will lapse is higher,
likely occurring as and when better alternatives emerge.', 

', u"Insurers have to emphasise need-based selling by understanding
the social behaviour of the proposed customer. They have to provide
high-quality customer service which is responsive to the
policyholder's requests. Then, competition with other financial
instruments and institutions will not become the cause behind the
lapsation of life insurance policies.", 

', In addition, flexible products, product switching, premium
holidays and reduced coverage can be offered to customers who
intend to continue with their policy but who (due to unforeseen
circumstances or sudden financial constraints) are unable to pay
their premiums.', 

', u"Customer's socio-economic background", 

', Awareness has to be created among younger age groups regarding
the importance of financial planning from the the first day they
begin earning. They should be educated as to the role of insurance
as a primary risk management tool in their financial planning.', 

', u"Life insurance companies should collect data of all withdrawals
and analyse their experience on regular basis to monitor
performance and control the sales outlets. Special incentives for
revival of lapsed orphan policies can be provided apart from giving
producers a share of commissions.An investor guide, life insurance
buyer's guide can be published and circulated. Customer service
camps can be conducted to explain their privileges, product
features, claims processing, grievance reddressal machinery and
several other policy servicing aspects. Increasing customer
sophistication and product disclosures can directly assist in
retention of business.", 

', While it is to be acknowledged that not one of the above
suggestions may be very effective in isolation in countering the
situation, the combined effect of all aspects taken together may
promise to be significant and yield results. ', 

', Conclusion', 

', u"The cost of lapsation is a waste and a drag on a life insurance
company's income and life fund. It reduces the profitability and
distributable surplus.", 

', u"The retention of existing business on the insurers' books is as
important, if not more important, as procuring new business.
Further income from an existing policy that has run for some years
is much more stable and therefore more certain to be realised for a
long time in the future.", 

', u"The adverse effect of lapsation and the subsequent decline in
bonus rates has very serious consequences on goodwill of the
industry. Insurance functionaries' efforts go to waste, although
the level of loss can never be correctly estimated and any
unscrupulous activities are not exposed to vigilance management
systems.", 

', Ultimately, lapsation benefits no-one. It is true that paying
premiums or continuing the policies are in the hands of the
policyholder. Still if a company can reduce the lapse rate through
their conservation efforts, all parties of a policy stand to
gain.', 

', u"The highly critical nature of this subject and its effect on
life insurance companies is now perhaps even more significant in
today's competitive life insurance sector. Hence, life insurers
should contemplate and initiate all possible steps in order to
ensure that lapsation, if it cannot be totally negated, is at least
kept at the minimum possible levels. Perhaps any cost paid for this
is worth it.", 

', So, the life insurance industry needs to pay attention not only
to procuring new business but also to preventing the lapsation or
surrender of old policies, improving the conservation of existing
business and thereby improving productivity and profitability.', 

', The study of lapsation helps companies to develop new products
and monitor marketing and product performance. The present study
can be extended further to the following other areas.', 

', 
', the impact of lapsation on the profitability of an insurance
company;', 

', the impact of lapsation on the pricing of an insurance
company;', 

', the impact of lapsation on the management expenses;', 

', causes of persistency in life insurance policies; and', 

', the use of expected lapse rates in the classification of life
insurance applicants. ',
