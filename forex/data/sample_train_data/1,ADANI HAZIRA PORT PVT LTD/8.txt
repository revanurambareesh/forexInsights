                ', Hazira Port \u2013 Making of a New Indian Gateway Port:', 

	            ', Situated on the west coast of India in Gujarat State, about 25 km from Surat city and about 250 km from Mumbai,', 
                ', Hazira (Surat) Port, often mentioned as just Hazira Port, is built by Hazira Port Private Limited (HPPL), a joint venture between two of the largest private LNG suppliers in the world and among the Global Top 10 Fortune companies, Shell Gas B.V (Shell) and Total Gaz Electricité Holdings France (Total).', 

                ', Strategic Location:', 

                ', u"The port has a great potential to serve as a 'Gateway Port' catering to diversified industry clusters in the hinterlands of North, West & Central India. These hinterlands together contribute about 65% of country\u2019s containerized traffic.", 

                ', Port location is strategic. Major industrial clusters are located within 200km reach of the port, in the Vadodara-Ankleswar-Hazira-Vapi belt. This industrially vibrant belt has the honor of being the largest industrial cluster in India. It is estimated that by 2012 this hinterland of the Hazira Port will generatecontainer cargo traffic of over 1 million TEU, about 8% of the national container traffic. In addition, at least 12 Special Economic Zones (SEZs) fall in the Vadodara-Hazira belt, resulting in escalation of demand for container port facilities.', 

	            ', The port also falls well within the planned Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC) and the industries within Vadodara-Vapi.', 
                ', The Port, again, is strategically located on the country\u2019s transport infrastructure arterial network- just 25 km away from Delhi-Mumbai mainline rail route and about 40km distant from National Highway (NH-8)', 

				', Port Design', 

                ', A : Current Facilities', 

                ', Designed as a deep-water, all-weather direct-berthing multi-cargo port, Hazira Port has been built with a protected harbour design, with 2 breakwaters and an additional waterfront for the development of non-LNG cargo handling facilities., The fully functional Hazira (Surat) port with a short approach channel of ~1km and draft of ~12m includes LNG jetty with an LNG storage and re-gasification terminal. Operational since April 2005 with an investment of about USD 700 million (over Rs. 3,000 crore), Hazira LNG Terminal & Port is among the largest international greenfield investments in India.', 
                ', Adani Hazira Port Pvt Ltd has additionally developed two container jetties and three Multipurpose jetties in the non LNG Port area.', 
                ', For details of non \u2013 LNG port services, please go to ', www.adanihaziraport.com', 

                ', B: Future Development', 

                ', The port has adequate water front and large port-backup area , with ample land for yards and an integrated logistics park, sufficient for development of several non-LNG cargo terminals and in particular container cargo terminals.', 

                ', Other planned facilities are Liquid Terminal (for clean oils, chemicals), RoRo Car Carrier Terminal, General Cargo terminals, Shipyard & services for Offshore Exploration industry.', 

                ', Rail & Road Connectivity', 

                ', The port is linked to both NH-6 and NH-8 (part of Golden Quadrilateral road network) connecting to the arterial National Highway between Delhi & Mumbai and traverses further to Central India. To further improve road logistics, the government is planning 6-lane widening of the existing roads between port and the national and state highways.', 

                ', A number of infrastructure initiatives are strengthening the Port linkages to key industrial and export hubs. The Gujarat Industrial Development Board (GIDB) has envisaged a multi-modal transport corridor from Hazira Port connecting to rail and road trunk routes. The Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL), Industries, Roads and other Departments as well as Gujarat Maritime Board of the Government of Gujarat have progressed planning of the proposed rail and road corridors. Indian Railways also plans to connect the port to the proposed Delhi-Mumbai Dedicated Freight Corridor (DFC) with a spur line of about 35km. This future linkage will enhance port\u2019s connectivity.',

                ', Hazira Port \u2013 Making of a New Indian Gateway Port:', 

	            ', Situated on the west coast of India in Gujarat State, about 25 km from Surat city and about 250 km from Mumbai,', 
                ', Hazira (Surat) Port, often mentioned as just Hazira Port, is built by Hazira Port Private Limited (HPPL), a joint venture between two of the largest private LNG suppliers in the world and among the Global Top 10 Fortune companies, Shell Gas B.V (Shell) and Total Gaz Electricité Holdings France (Total).', 

                ', Strategic Location:', 

                ', u"The port has a great potential to serve as a 'Gateway Port' catering to diversified industry clusters in the hinterlands of North, West & Central India. These hinterlands together contribute about 65% of country\u2019s containerized traffic.", 

                ', Port location is strategic. Major industrial clusters are located within 200km reach of the port, in the Vadodara-Ankleswar-Hazira-Vapi belt. This industrially vibrant belt has the honor of being the largest industrial cluster in India. It is estimated that by 2012 this hinterland of the Hazira Port will generatecontainer cargo traffic of over 1 million TEU, about 8% of the national container traffic. In addition, at least 12 Special Economic Zones (SEZs) fall in the Vadodara-Hazira belt, resulting in escalation of demand for container port facilities.', 

	            ', The port also falls well within the planned Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC) and the industries within Vadodara-Vapi.', 
                ', The Port, again, is strategically located on the country\u2019s transport infrastructure arterial network- just 25 km away from Delhi-Mumbai mainline rail route and about 40km distant from National Highway (NH-8)', 

				', Port Design', 

                ', A : Current Facilities', 

                ', Designed as a deep-water, all-weather direct-berthing multi-cargo port, Hazira Port has been built with a protected harbour design, with 2 breakwaters and an additional waterfront for the development of non-LNG cargo handling facilities., The fully functional Hazira (Surat) port with a short approach channel of ~1km and draft of ~12m includes LNG jetty with an LNG storage and re-gasification terminal. Operational since April 2005 with an investment of about USD 700 million (over Rs. 3,000 crore), Hazira LNG Terminal & Port is among the largest international greenfield investments in India.', 
                ', Adani Hazira Port Pvt Ltd has additionally developed two container jetties and three Multipurpose jetties in the non LNG Port area.', 
                ', For details of non \u2013 LNG port services, please go to ', www.adanihaziraport.com', 

                ', B: Future Development', 

                ', The port has adequate water front and large port-backup area , with ample land for yards and an integrated logistics park, sufficient for development of several non-LNG cargo terminals and in particular container cargo terminals.', 

                ', Other planned facilities are Liquid Terminal (for clean oils, chemicals), RoRo Car Carrier Terminal, General Cargo terminals, Shipyard & services for Offshore Exploration industry.', 

                ', Rail & Road Connectivity', 

                ', The port is linked to both NH-6 and NH-8 (part of Golden Quadrilateral road network) connecting to the arterial National Highway between Delhi & Mumbai and traverses further to Central India. To further improve road logistics, the government is planning 6-lane widening of the existing roads between port and the national and state highways.', 

                ', A number of infrastructure initiatives are strengthening the Port linkages to key industrial and export hubs. The Gujarat Industrial Development Board (GIDB) has envisaged a multi-modal transport corridor from Hazira Port connecting to rail and road trunk routes. The Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL), Industries, Roads and other Departments as well as Gujarat Maritime Board of the Government of Gujarat have progressed planning of the proposed rail and road corridors. Indian Railways also plans to connect the port to the proposed Delhi-Mumbai Dedicated Freight Corridor (DFC) with a spur line of about 35km. This future linkage will enhance port\u2019s connectivity.',
