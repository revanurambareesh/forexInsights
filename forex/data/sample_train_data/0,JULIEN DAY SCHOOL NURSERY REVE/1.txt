Our teaching and learning theories are based on proven educational practices. At the same time, they are adapted to the contemporary and innovative methods gaining popularity across the globe today. We use cognitive, emotional, and environmental influences to help students absorb, process and retain information more effectively. We also make it a point to include a wide variety of experiential and visual approaches.

', LEARNING OUTCOMES', 

',

', We believe that group activities help children to develop their communication skills and improve their interpersonal relationships. Collaborative learning techniques are used to improve team-building skills such as organisation, delegation, negotiation, teamwork, cooperation and leadership.', 
', Circle Time', 
', Circle Time is a social activity that encourages informal yet meaningful discussions in class, allowing students to exchange thoughts and learn from one another. The circle formation in which they sit ensures that each student can see all the other members of their class. We believe that it raises their self-worth while encouraging them to be more open and trusting.', 
',  Field Trips', 
', Field trips help deepen a student\u2019s interest in a topic by creating a more hands-on, relevant learning experience. They also benefit teachers by giving them opportunities to generate greater attentiveness to a subject.

At Pearson, our pedagogy focuses on \u2018how\u2019 teaching and learning occur. We use an array of teaching strategies that include direct instruction, collaborative learning and inquiry based learning.

All of which help students to improve their learning outcomes and achieve their full potential.',

', 
', 
Our teaching and learning theories are based on proven educational practices. At the same time, they are adapted to the contemporary and innovative methods gaining popularity across the globe today. We use cognitive, emotional, and environmental influences to help students absorb, process and retain information more effectively. We also make it a point to include a wide variety of experiential and visual approaches.

', LEARNING OUTCOMES', 

',

', We believe that group activities help children to develop their communication skills and improve their interpersonal relationships. Collaborative learning techniques are used to improve team-building skills such as organisation, delegation, negotiation, teamwork, cooperation and leadership.', 
', Circle Time', 
', Circle Time is a social activity that encourages informal yet meaningful discussions in class, allowing students to exchange thoughts and learn from one another. The circle formation in which they sit ensures that each student can see all the other members of their class. We believe that it raises their self-worth while encouraging them to be more open and trusting.', 
',  Field Trips', 
', Field trips help deepen a student\u2019s interest in a topic by creating a more hands-on, relevant learning experience. They also benefit teachers by giving them opportunities to generate greater attentiveness to a subject. We schedule many field trips in an academic year; they have proven to be a great asset in the learning process. ', 
', Star of the Week ',

They are specially trained to do so through a series of training programmes. One of these is the In-Service Teaching Programme. It provides solutions to matters related to curricula, content and technology; it develops individual teaching styles; and it helps teachers to assess themselves using feedback from students, colleagues and the management.
