					', Styrax benzoin',  trees, native to the island Sumatra, Indonesia are wounded to produce resin that is collected and burned as incense. These wounds on trees commonly develop into expanding cankers that lead to tree death. The aim of this study was to consider whether Ophiostomatoid fungi, typically associated with wounds on trees might be associated with resin harvesting on ', S. benzoin', . Samples were collected from the edges of artificially induced wounds, and particularly where cankers and staining of the vascular tissue was evident. Tissue samples were incubated in moist chambers and carrot baiting was also used to detect the presence of ', Ceratocystis',  spp. Fruiting structures with morphology typical of species in the ', C. fimbriata',  s.l. species complex and species in the anamorph genus ', Thielaviopsis',  were found, on both the incubated wood and the carrot baits. DNA sequences were generated for the Internal Transcribed Spacer regions 1 and 2 including the 5.8S rRNA gene, part of the \u03b2-tubulin and the Transcription Elongation Factor 1-\u03b1 gene regions. These data were compared with those of other species in the ', C. fimbriata',  s.l. species complex and ', Thielaviopsis',  using phylogenetic analysis. Morphology of the isolates in culture as well as phylogenetic inference showed that the ', Thielaviopsis',  sp. present on the wounds was ', T. basicola.',  The ', Ceratocystis',  sp. from ', S. benzoin',  represents a new taxon in the ', C. fimbriata',  s.l. complex described here as ', C. larium',  sp. nov.', Keywords: ', Ophiostomatoid fungi, phylogenetic inference, vascular staining', INTRODUCTION', Trees in the genus ', Styrax',  are native to the Northern Hemisphere including eastern and south-eastern Asia and South America, where they occur in warm temperate areas (', Burkill 1935', ). There are about 150 species of ', Styrax',  and many are used to produce resin that is aromatic when burned. ', Styrax benzoin',  trees in Indonesia, specifically Sumatra: commonly referred to as Sumatra Benzoin are tapped for resin, which is collected and dried. The dried resin produces fragrant aromas when burned and is thus a valuable source of incense, which is believed to have magical properties (', Wheatley 1959', ). More than 18 000 families in northern Sumatra alone are dependant on benzoin production (', Wollenberg et al. 2004', ).', Wounds on ', S. benzoin',  trees often develop into cankers that can eventually girdle and kill them. Such wounds are commonly associated with vascular staining, typical of that resulting from infection by ophiostomatoid fungi (', Wingfield et al. 1993', , ', Zhou et al. 2008', ). These fungi and particularly species of ', Ceratocystis',  s.l. have the capacity to infect wounds and kill trees (', Bretz 1952', , ', Norris 1953', , ', de Vay et al. 1963', , ', Kile 1993', ).', 
				', Ceratocystis',  s.l. represents a diverse species complex with distinct groups of taxa separated by clear phylogenetic, morphological and ecological boundaries. These groups are in the process of being assigned generic status. Many of these fungi infect wounds on trees but some are also symbionts of conifer infesting bark beetles. Various ', Ceratocystis',  spp. have been found infecting wounds on trees made during agronomic practices or bark harvesting, often resulting in serious disease problems (', de Vay et al. 1963', , ', Kile 1993', , ', Marin et al. 2003', ).', The aim of this study was to consider whether wounds made on ', S. benzoin',  trees in the resin harvesting process might be infected with ', Ceratocystis',  spp. and to identify these fungi based on morphology and phylogenetic analyses.', MATERIALS AND METHODS', Isolates', Wounds made on ', S. benzoin',  trees (', Fig. 1', ) were inspected and samples were taken where vascular staining and gummosis was evident (', Fig. 1', ). Samples were wrapped in newspaper and transported to the laboratory. Wood samples were incubated in a moist environment and inspected directly for fungal growth (', Fig. 1', ). Spores produced by fungal structures on the wood surface were transferred onto 2 % malt extract agar (MEA: 20 % w/v; Biolab, Midrand, South Africa) supplemented with 100 mg/L streptomycin sulphate (SIGMA). Pieces of wood were also placed between two slices of 10 mm carrot pieces that were initially treated with streptomycin sulphate to bait for species of ', Ceratocystis',  (', Moller & de Vay 1968a', ). Pure cultures were obtained (', Fig. 1', ) and these were deposited in the culture collection (CMW) of the Forestry and Agricultural Biotechnology Institute (FABI), The University of Pretoria, South Africa. Representative isolates were also lodged with the Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures (CBS), Utrecht, The Netherlands. Representative cultures were dried and deposited with the National Herbarium of South Africa (PREM).', Fig. 1', Isolation of species of fungi from ', Styrax benzoin',  in Indonesia. a.

(2006)',  for six selected isolates representing two morphological groups. PCR reactions for the Internal Transcribed Spacer regions (ITS) 1 and 2 including the 5.8S rDNA, the \u03b2-tubulin and the Transcription Elongation Factor 1\u03b1 (EF-1\u03b1) were prepared as described by ', van Wyk et al. (2006)', . The conditions for the PCRs were as described by ', van Wyk et al. (2006)',  with the annealing temperature at 55 °C for all three gene regions. The primers used to amplify the DNA for these three regions were those of ', White et al. (1990)', , ', Glass & Donaldson (1995)',  and ', Jacobs et al. (2004)', , respectively.', An ABI PRISM', TM', 
 Big DYE Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (Applied BioSystems, Foster City, California, USA) was used to prepare the PCR amplicons for sequencing. An ABI PRISM', TM', 
 3100 Autosequencer (Applied BioSystems, Foster City, California, USA) was used to run the sequencing reactions. Sequences were analysed with Chromas Lite 2.01 (', http://www.technelysium.com.a, ). The sequences obtained were subjected to Blast analysis in the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (', www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov', ) to confirm the identity of the genera present. This showed the presence of isolates representing the ', C. fimbriata',  s.l. species complex and others of a ', Thielaviopsis',  species.', The sequences obtained, together with other closely related species, obtained from GenBank (', Table 1', ) were aligned using MAFFT (', http://align.bmr.kyushu-u.ac.jp/mafft/software/source.html', ) (', Katoh et al. 2002', ) for each dataset. The alignments were manually inspected and corrected where necessary. Sequences were analysed using Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony (PAUP) v. 4.0b10 (', Swofford 2002', ). A partition homogeneity test (', Swofford 2002', ) was run to determine whether sequence data for three gene regions could be combined. In PAUP, gaps were treated as a fifth character and trees were obtained via stepwise addition of 1 000 replicates, the Mulpar option was in effect and the heuristic search option based on parsimony with stepwise addition was selected. Confidence intervals using 1 000 bootstrap replicates were calculated. ', Ceratocystis virescens',  was the designated outgroup for the dataset containing the ', C. fimbriata',  s.l. species. ', Ceratocystis fimbriata',  s.str. was designated as the outgroup for the ', Thielaviopsis',  dataset.

Fungal structures were mounted on glass slides in lactic acid and these were examined using a Zeiss Axio Vision microscope. Fifty measurements were made for each taxonomically relevant structure. Ranges, averages and standard deviations (SD) were determined for each of these characters. Colours of structures and cultures were assessed using the mycological colour charts of ', Rayner (1970)', .', To determine the optimum temperature for growth of isolates, growth studies were performed on three isolates representing the unknown ', Ceratocystis',  sp. A 5 mm plug from the margin of an actively growing culture (2-wk-old) was placed at the centres of 90 mm 2 % MEA Petri dishes. There were five replicates for each isolate at each temperature and growth was assessed between 5\u201335 °C at 5 °C intervals after 7 d. The entire study was repeated once.', RESULTS', Isolates', Fresh fungal structures were found on the wood surface of the samples collected from wounded ', S. benzoin',  trees in Indonesia. The fungal structures were characteristic of two different fungi, one with perithecia similar to those of ', Ceratocystis',  spp. in the ', C. fimbriata',  s.l. species complex and the other, a ', Thielaviopsis',  sp. with septate chlamydospores. Sixteen isolates were collected of which six represented a ', Thielaviopsis',  sp. and the remaining cultures were of a ', Ceratocystis',  sp.', Phylogenetic analyses', For the ', C. fimbriata',  s.l. isolates, amplicons of ± 500 bp (ITS and \u03b2-tubulin) and ± 800 bp (EF-1\u03b1) were obtained. A P-value of 0.01 was obtained for the PHT showing that the three datasets could be combined (', Sullivan 1996', , ', Cunningham 1997', ). This combined dataset consisted of 1 988 characters, of which 1 102 were constant, 46 were parsimony uninformative and 840 were parsimony informative. Seven most parsimonious trees were obtained, one of which was selected for presentation (', Fig. 2', ). The tree is described as follows; Tree length (TL) = 2 030 steps, Consistency Index (CI) = 0.7, Retention Index (RI) = 0.9 and Rescaled Consistency Index (RC) = 0.6.', Fig. 2', One of seven most parsimonious phylogenetic trees, based on the combined regions of the ITS, \u03b2-tubulin and EF-1\u03b1 for ', Ceratocystis larium',  and other species in the ', C. fimbriata',  s.l. species complex.

All posterior probabilities were high, supporting the separate species within the ', C. fimbriata',  s.l. species complex.', MrModeltest2.2 selected the HKY+I+G model for the ITS gene region as the most suited. For the \u03b2-tubulin gene region, the GTR+G model was selected while the HKY+I+G model were selected for the EF-1\u03b1 gene region. The selected models were incorporated into the Bayesian analysis. Two thousand trees were discarded to exclude any trees that were drawn outside of the point of convergence. All posterior probabilities that were obtained with parsimony were confirmed with the Bayesian analyses (', Fig. 2', ).', In the case of the ', Thielaviopsis',  isolates, amplicons of ± 500 bp (ITS and \u03b2-tubulin) and ± 800 bp (EF-1\u03b1) were obtained.

					', Thielaviopsis basicola',  is a very well-known fungus with characteristic and distinct segmented chlamydospores. An isolate (CMW 25438) was selected randomly to confirm that morphologically these isolates are representatives of ', T. basicola', . Dark clumps of conidiophores were evident in cultures. The very distinct chlamydospores of ', T. basicola',  were also present.', For the ', C. fimbriata',  s.l. isolates: one isolate (CMW 25434) was chosen to represent the fungus and three additional isolates (CMW 25435, 25436 and 25437) were chosen as additional specimens for description purposes. The cultures of ', C. fimbriata',  s.l. isolates had a light greyish olive (21\u201d\u201d\u201db) colour (', Rayner 1970', ). These isolates were slow growing. No growth was observed at 4 °C and 35 °C. Limited growth was observed at 10 °C (5 mm), 15 °C (10 mm) and 30 °C (6.5 mm). Intermediate growth was observed at 20 °C (12.4 mm) with optimal growth at 25 °C (13.5 mm) in 7 d. The cultures had a strong banana odour similar to that of many ', Ceratocystis',  spp. Micro-morphological characteristics distinct for the isolates from Indonesia included the pirilliform ascomatal bases and both the cylindrical and barrel-shaped conidia were of variable size. Similarly variable sizes were observed for the chlamydospores.', The ', Ceratocystis',  isolates from wounds on ', S. benzoin',  trees are phylogenetically and morphologically distinct from all other ', Ceratocystis',  spp. residing in the ', C. fimbriata',  s.l. clade.

These fungi were identified based on morphology and phylogenetic inference and included ', Thielaviopsis basicola',  and an undescribed species of ', Ceratocystis',  residing in the ', C. fimbriata',  s.l. species complex and which has been given the name ', C. larium', . Both fungi were commonly found on the surface of wounds on ', S. benzoin',  trees and ', C. larium',  was also easily collected from stained tissue using carrot baiting.', 
				', Thielaviopsis basicola',  is a well-known soil-borne pathogen of many root crops (', Nag Raj & Kendrick 1975', , ', Geldenhuis et al. 2006', ) and its presence on the surface of wounds on trees might seem unusual. However, it has been identified as being associated with insects that vector the conidia and/or chlamydospores (', Labuschagne & Kotze 1991', , ', Stanghellini et al. 1999', ). It is thus possible that insects, for example ants that live in the soil, are attracted by the aromatic gum that accumulates at the wound sites of the trees, thereby carrying the soil-borne fungus to the sites from which it was isolated in this study. Because it is also a carrot pathogen (', Geldenhuis et al. 2006', ), it can be found on carrot baits used to isolate ', Ceratocystis',  spp., but in the case of this study it was found sporulating on the surface of wounds and had no association with carrots.', The presence of a ', Ceratocystis',  sp. associated with wounds on ', S. benzoin',  trees is not surprising as these fungi are commonly found on wounds on trees (', Kile 1993', ). Indeed, various species of ', Ceratocystis',  have been trapped from the environment by artificially wounding trees (', Barnes et al. 2003', ). In this case, wounds are visited by sap-feeding insects that are also attracted to the fruity aromas produced by many ', Ceratocystis',  spp. (', Moller & de Vay 1968b', ). We hence assume that ', C', . ', larium',  was carried to wounds on ', S. benzoin',  by such insects.', 
				', Ceratocystis larium',  represents a discrete taxon. Based on phylogenetic inference for the ITS, \u03b2-tubulin and the EF-1\u03b1 gene regions, ', C. larium',  is most closely related to ', C. albifundus', . ', Ceratocystis albifundus',  is most distinct from all the other species within the ', C. fimbriata',  s.l. species complex with no species phylogenetically closely related to it. ', Ceratocystis larium', , residing in a phylogenetically sister group to ', C. albifundus,',  is thus also clearly distinct from all other species in the ', C. fimbriata',  s.l', .',  species complex.', Morphologically, ', C. larium',  is similar to other species in the ', C. fimbriata',  s.l. species. In this regard, it has a grey to green colony colour and a fruity odour. Similar to ', C. pirilliformis',  (', Barnes et al. 2003', ) and ', C. obpyriformis',  (', Heath et al. 2009', ), it has pirilliform ascomatal bases. However, the cylindrical conidia in ', C. larium',  differ substantially in size and shape from each other and this distinct variation is also true for the barrel-shaped conidia. Although variation is expected within a species, there is no other species in the ', C. fimbriata',  s.l. species complex that displays this remarkable variability in size and shape of the conidia. Chlamydospores in ', C. larium',  are also variable in shape, ranging from prolate spheroidal to perprolate and these structures are also abundant in this species.', 
				', Ceratocystis larium',  is clearly an opportunistic fungus that infects wounds made to tap the resin of ', S. benzoin',  trees. Nothing is known regarding the pathogenicity of this fungus or ', T. basicola',  on these trees. However, many wounds made to the trees develop into significant cankers that appear to eventually lead to tree death. Pathogenicity of these fungi should thus be tested and if they are contributing to the death of trees, efforts should be made to restrict their presence.', Acknowledgments', We thank Mr. Jongi Seraghi for assisting us to collect samples and Dr Hugh Glen for proposing a name for the new species and for providing the Latin translation.

					', Styrax benzoin',  trees, native to the island Sumatra, Indonesia are wounded to produce resin that is collected and burned as incense. These wounds on trees commonly develop into expanding cankers that lead to tree death. The aim of this study was to consider whether Ophiostomatoid fungi, typically associated with wounds on trees might be associated with resin harvesting on ', S. benzoin', . Samples were collected from the edges of artificially induced wounds, and particularly where cankers and staining of the vascular tissue was evident. Tissue samples were incubated in moist chambers and carrot baiting was also used to detect the presence of ', Ceratocystis',  spp. Fruiting structures with morphology typical of species in the ', C. fimbriata',  s.l. species complex and species in the anamorph genus ', Thielaviopsis',  were found, on both the incubated wood and the carrot baits. DNA sequences were generated for the Internal Transcribed Spacer regions 1 and 2 including the 5.8S rRNA gene, part of the \u03b2-tubulin and the Transcription Elongation Factor 1-\u03b1 gene regions. These data were compared with those of other species in the ', C. fimbriata',  s.l. species complex and ', Thielaviopsis',  using phylogenetic analysis. Morphology of the isolates in culture as well as phylogenetic inference showed that the ', Thielaviopsis',  sp. present on the wounds was ', T. basicola.',  The ', Ceratocystis',  sp. from ', S. benzoin',  represents a new taxon in the ', C. fimbriata',  s.l. complex described here as ', C. larium',  sp. nov.', Keywords: ', Ophiostomatoid fungi, phylogenetic inference, vascular staining', INTRODUCTION', Trees in the genus ', Styrax',  are native to the Northern Hemisphere including eastern and south-eastern Asia and South America, where they occur in warm temperate areas (', Burkill 1935', ). There are about 150 species of ', Styrax',  and many are used to produce resin that is aromatic when burned. ', Styrax benzoin',  trees in Indonesia, specifically Sumatra: commonly referred to as Sumatra Benzoin are tapped for resin, which is collected and dried. The dried resin produces fragrant aromas when burned and is thus a valuable source of incense, which is believed to have magical properties (', Wheatley 1959', ). More than 18 000 families in northern Sumatra alone are dependant on benzoin production (', Wollenberg et al. 2004', ).', Wounds on ', S. benzoin',  trees often develop into cankers that can eventually girdle and kill them. Such wounds are commonly associated with vascular staining, typical of that resulting from infection by ophiostomatoid fungi (', Wingfield et al. 1993', , ', Zhou et al. 2008', ). These fungi and particularly species of ', Ceratocystis',  s.l. have the capacity to infect wounds and kill trees (', Bretz 1952', , ', Norris 1953', , ', de Vay et al. 1963', , ', Kile 1993', ).', 
				', Ceratocystis',  s.l. represents a diverse species complex with distinct groups of taxa separated by clear phylogenetic, morphological and ecological boundaries. These groups are in the process of being assigned generic status. Many of these fungi infect wounds on trees but some are also symbionts of conifer infesting bark beetles. Various ', Ceratocystis',  spp. have been found infecting wounds on trees made during agronomic practices or bark harvesting, often resulting in serious disease problems (', de Vay et al. 1963', , ', Kile 1993', , ', Marin et al. 2003', ).', The aim of this study was to consider whether wounds made on ', S. benzoin',  trees in the resin harvesting process might be infected with ', Ceratocystis',  spp. and to identify these fungi based on morphology and phylogenetic analyses.', MATERIALS AND METHODS', Isolates', Wounds made on ', S. benzoin',  trees (', Fig. 1', ) were inspected and samples were taken where vascular staining and gummosis was evident (', Fig. 1', ). Samples were wrapped in newspaper and transported to the laboratory. Wood samples were incubated in a moist environment and inspected directly for fungal growth (', Fig. 1', ). Spores produced by fungal structures on the wood surface were transferred onto 2 % malt extract agar (MEA: 20 % w/v; Biolab, Midrand, South Africa) supplemented with 100 mg/L streptomycin sulphate (SIGMA). Pieces of wood were also placed between two slices of 10 mm carrot pieces that were initially treated with streptomycin sulphate to bait for species of ', Ceratocystis',  (', Moller & de Vay 1968a', ). Pure cultures were obtained (', Fig. 1', ) and these were deposited in the culture collection (CMW) of the Forestry and Agricultural Biotechnology Institute (FABI), The University of Pretoria, South Africa. Representative isolates were also lodged with the Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures (CBS), Utrecht, The Netherlands. Representative cultures were dried and deposited with the National Herbarium of South Africa (PREM).', Fig. 1', Isolation of species of fungi from ', Styrax benzoin',  in Indonesia. a. Triangular wounds created with a knife for gum exudation; b. exposed wound from ', S. benzoin',  trees illustrating gummosis and wood discolouration; c. fungal growth on collected pieces of',  ', ...', Phylogenetic analyses', DNA was extracted, as described by ', van Wyk et al. (2006)',  for six selected isolates representing two morphological groups. PCR reactions for the Internal Transcribed Spacer regions (ITS) 1 and 2 including the 5.8S rDNA, the \u03b2-tubulin and the Transcription Elongation Factor 1\u03b1 (EF-1\u03b1) were prepared as described by ', van Wyk et al. (2006)', . The conditions for the PCRs were as described by ', van Wyk et al. (2006)',  with the annealing temperature at 55 °C for all three gene regions. The primers used to amplify the DNA for these three regions were those of ', White et al. (1990)', , ', Glass & Donaldson (1995)',  and ', Jacobs et al. (2004)', , respectively.', An ABI PRISM', TM', 
 Big DYE Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (Applied BioSystems, Foster City, California, USA) was used to prepare the PCR amplicons for sequencing. An ABI PRISM', TM', 
 3100 Autosequencer (Applied BioSystems, Foster City, California, USA) was used to run the sequencing reactions. Sequences were analysed with Chromas Lite 2.01 (', http://www.technelysium.com.a, ). The sequences obtained were subjected to Blast analysis in the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (', www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov', ) to confirm the identity of the genera present. This showed the presence of isolates representing the ', C. fimbriata',  s.l. species complex and others of a ', Thielaviopsis',  species.', The sequences obtained, together with other closely related species, obtained from GenBank (', Table 1', ) were aligned using MAFFT (', http://align.bmr.kyushu-u.ac.jp/mafft/software/source.html', ) (', Katoh et al. 2002', ) for each dataset. The alignments were manually inspected and corrected where necessary. Sequences were analysed using Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony (PAUP) v. 4.0b10 (', Swofford 2002', ). A partition homogeneity test (', Swofford 2002', ) was run to determine whether sequence data for three gene regions could be combined. In PAUP, gaps were treated as a fifth character and trees were obtained via stepwise addition of 1 000 replicates, the Mulpar option was in effect and the heuristic search option based on parsimony with stepwise addition was selected. Confidence intervals using 1 000 bootstrap replicates were calculated. ', Ceratocystis virescens',  was the designated outgroup for the dataset containing the ', C. fimbriata',  s.l. species. ', Ceratocystis fimbriata',  s.str. was designated as the outgroup for the ', Thielaviopsis',  dataset.

There were five replicates for each isolate at each temperature and growth was assessed between 5\u201335 °C at 5 °C intervals after 7 d. The entire study was repeated once.', RESULTS', Isolates', Fresh fungal structures were found on the wood surface of the samples collected from wounded ', S. benzoin',  trees in Indonesia. The fungal structures were characteristic of two different fungi, one with perithecia similar to those of ', Ceratocystis',  spp. in the ', C. fimbriata',  s.l. species complex and the other, a ', Thielaviopsis',  sp. with septate chlamydospores.

					', Thielaviopsis basicola',  is a very well-known fungus with characteristic and distinct segmented chlamydospores. An isolate (CMW 25438) was selected randomly to confirm that morphologically these isolates are representatives of ', T. basicola', . Dark clumps of conidiophores were evident in cultures. The very distinct chlamydospores of ', T. basicola',  were also present.', For the ', C. fimbriata',  s.l. isolates: one isolate (CMW 25434) was chosen to represent the fungus and three additional isolates (CMW 25435, 25436 and 25437) were chosen as additional specimens for description purposes. The cultures of ', C. fimbriata',  s.l. isolates had a light greyish olive (21\u201d\u201d\u201db) colour (', Rayner 1970', ). These isolates were slow growing. No growth was observed at 4 °C and 35 °C. Limited growth was observed at 10 °C (5 mm), 15 °C (10 mm) and 30 °C (6.5 mm). Intermediate growth was observed at 20 °C (12.4 mm) with optimal growth at 25 °C (13.5 mm) in 7 d. The cultures had a strong banana odour similar to that of many ', Ceratocystis',  spp. Micro-morphological characteristics distinct for the isolates from Indonesia included the pirilliform ascomatal bases and both the cylindrical and barrel-shaped conidia were of variable size. Similarly variable sizes were observed for the chlamydospores.', The ', Ceratocystis',  isolates from wounds on ', S. benzoin',  trees are phylogenetically and morphologically distinct from all other ', Ceratocystis',  spp. residing in the ', C. fimbriata',  s.l. clade.

These fungi were identified based on morphology and phylogenetic inference and included ', Thielaviopsis basicola',  and an undescribed species of ', Ceratocystis',  residing in the ', C. fimbriata',  s.l. species complex and which has been given the name ', C. larium', . Both fungi were commonly found on the surface of wounds on ', S. benzoin',  trees and ', C. larium',  was also easily collected from stained tissue using carrot baiting.', 
				', Thielaviopsis basicola',  is a well-known soil-borne pathogen of many root crops (', Nag Raj & Kendrick 1975', , ', Geldenhuis et al. 2006', ) and its presence on the surface of wounds on trees might seem unusual. However, it has been identified as being associated with insects that vector the conidia and/or chlamydospores (', Labuschagne & Kotze 1991', , ', Stanghellini et al. 1999', ). It is thus possible that insects, for example ants that live in the soil, are attracted by the aromatic gum that accumulates at the wound sites of the trees, thereby carrying the soil-borne fungus to the sites from which it was isolated in this study. Because it is also a carrot pathogen (', Geldenhuis et al. 2006', ), it can be found on carrot baits used to isolate ', Ceratocystis',  spp., but in the case of this study it was found sporulating on the surface of wounds and had no association with carrots.', The presence of a ', Ceratocystis',  sp. associated with wounds on ', S. benzoin',  trees is not surprising as these fungi are commonly found on wounds on trees (', Kile 1993', ). Indeed, various species of ', Ceratocystis',  have been trapped from the environment by artificially wounding trees (', Barnes et al. 2003', ). In this case, wounds are visited by sap-feeding insects that are also attracted to the fruity aromas produced by many ', Ceratocystis',  spp. (', Moller & de Vay 1968b', ). We hence assume that ', C', . ', larium',  was carried to wounds on ', S. benzoin',  by such insects.', 
				', Ceratocystis larium',  represents a discrete taxon. Based on phylogenetic inference for the ITS, \u03b2-tubulin and the EF-1\u03b1 gene regions, ', C. larium',  is most closely related to ', C. albifundus', . ', Ceratocystis albifundus',  is most distinct from all the other species within the ', C. fimbriata',  s.l. species complex with no species phylogenetically closely related to it. ', Ceratocystis larium', , residing in a phylogenetically sister group to ', C. albifundus,',  is thus also clearly distinct from all other species in the ', C. fimbriata',  s.l', .',  species complex.', Morphologically, ', C. larium',  is similar to other species in the ', C. fimbriata',  s.l. species. In this regard, it has a grey to green colony colour and a fruity odour. Similar to ', C. pirilliformis',  (', Barnes et al. 2003', ) and ', C. obpyriformis',  (', Heath et al. 2009', ), it has pirilliform ascomatal bases. However, the cylindrical conidia in ', C. larium',  differ substantially in size and shape from each other and this distinct variation is also true for the barrel-shaped conidia. Although variation is expected within a species, there is no other species in the ', C. fimbriata',  s.l. species complex that displays this remarkable variability in size and shape of the conidia. Chlamydospores in ', C. larium',  are also variable in shape, ranging from prolate spheroidal to perprolate and these structures are also abundant in this species.', 
				', Ceratocystis larium',  is clearly an opportunistic fungus that infects wounds made to tap the resin of ', S. benzoin',  trees. Nothing is known regarding the pathogenicity of this fungus or ', T. basicola',  on these trees. However, many wounds made to the trees develop into significant cankers that appear to eventually lead to tree death. Pathogenicity of these fungi should thus be tested and if they are contributing to the death of trees, efforts should be made to restrict their presence.', Acknowledgments', We thank Mr. Jongi Seraghi for assisting us to collect samples and Dr Hugh Glen for proposing a name for the new species and for providing the Latin translation.
