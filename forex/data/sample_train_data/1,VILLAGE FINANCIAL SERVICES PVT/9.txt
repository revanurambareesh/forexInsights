There are 72 applicants in the fray, but who will be the lucky ones? Atmadip Ray and Shilpy Sinha profile some of the applicants.  ",   ',   ',   ',     Kuldip Maity    ',     ',     Line-up Managing Director & CEO, Village Financial Services  ',   ',   ',   ',   ',   ',   ', u"  For some fnance companies, adding spice to business may be a way of life. For some, cooking up numbers could be the main business. But here's someone who wants to deliver the Planter's Punch \u2014 Kuldip Maity (37), the chief executive of Village Financial Services, who morphed into a financier from a hotelier.  ",   ',   Maity had to leave a career in the hospitality industry on the orders of his social worker father. In 1998, Ajit Kumar Maity lifted his son out of the world of cocktails to join Village Welfare Society, a not-for-profit entity engaged in women empowerment since 1982.  ',   ',   The group started micro lending in 1996. A decade later it acquired a local non-banking finance company and renamed it Village Financial Services.  ',   ', u"  Kuldip has been the CEO of the NBFC operation from the beginning and steered it to build a Rs 110-crore outstanding loan portfolio without any institutional equity or private equity support unlike most of his rivals. In his formative years as a professional, Kuldip had worked with Chandra Shekhar Ghosh, who was then the operation head in the country's first NBFC-MFI.  ",   ', u"  Ghosh left the group in 2000 to create Bandhan, which will take off as a universal bank. Over the past nine years, Village Financial has created a reasonable presence in the eastern region with 106 branches. Its network may look scanty when compared to Bandhan's formidable 2,022-strong branch network, but it is still the second largest MFI in ", West Bengal', u" in terms of branch network, ahead of Arohan with 104 and Jagaran Microfin's 50 branches.  ",   ', u"  Kuldip's Village Financial is also present in ", Assam',  and Bihar. It can be a serious contender for a small finance bank licence from the eastern zone along with Kolkatabased Jagaran Microfin and Guwahati-based RGVN (North East) ', Microfinance',  since the banking regulator said it would give preference to entities in the North East, East and Central regions, which are largely under-banked. ', RBI',  expects small finance banks to serve local people and local businesses for the first five years.  ',   ',   ',     Banking on Basics    ',     ',      ', Sanjay Agarwal',  MD, AU Financier  ',   ',   ',   ',   ',   ',   ',   ',   When ', HDFC Bank', u" was looking for a business correspondent \u2014 a relationship unit to build clientele in rural and semi-urban areas without opening a bank branch \u2014 it shortlisted Sanjay Agarwal of AU Financier. Making it into HDFC Bank's books was a stamp of approval for the investing community.  ",   ',   When top private equity firms such as Warburg Pincus, ChrysCapital and Kedaara Capital wanted a share of the growing pie of the financial services sector, the target was AU. There was no looking back for Agarwal \u2014 his profits grew to Rs 150 crore in 2014-15. Now that he has established the finance company, he has applied for a small bank licence.  ',   ',   What can be a more profitable business in a country where the geographical vastness makes transportation of goods difficult: Fund truck purchases. Behind Agarwal's decision to become a lender was no rocket science, but just a basic necessity of the economy. "The first loan of Rs 1.5 lakh was given to buy a Maruti Omni," says Agarwal. "We approached people who do not file IT returns in the three -wheeler commercial segment and they proved to be good risks," he says.  ',   ',   A chartered accountant, Agarwal ventured out in 1994 with borrowings from local jewellers, builders and even exporters to begin a finance company. But there was trouble \u2014 from the investors, regulators, and markets. That was a time when the CRB scandal, where a non-banking finance company founded by Chain Roop Bhansali, committed fraud leading to tightening of regulations and closure of hundreds of such firms.  ',   ', u"  Also, 'wealthy' individuals who are used to seeing their money double in months in stock markets and businesses, were unwilling to wait till Agarwal built his. That period was a learning \u2014 don't go aggressive in building the business, and do not rely on wealthy individuals. When HDFC Bank wanted AU to bring in more capital, Agarwal started looking for investors who could bring in long-term money.  ",   ', u"  HNIs didn't fit the bill. With the help of a friend, he got introduced to Vishal Tulsyan and Ramdeo Agarwal of Motilal Oswal, whose private equity fund invested in it. Then came International Finance Corporation, a member of the ", World Bank Group', , which turned its fortunes.  ',   ',   ',     Touching the Bottom of the Pyramid    ',     ',     Sudipta Banerjee, SECRETARY, ', Sahara Utsarga',  Welfare Society  ',   ',   ',   ',   ',   ',   When it comes to microfinance companies from West Bengal, the first name that comes to mind is Bandhan. But there were institutions which were into the business much before but did not scale up. Sudipta Banerjee, born into a family of politicians, need not think much about a career \u2014 just join the family business of politics. He did so, but disillusionment followed soon enough. Student politics had left Banerjee, the secretary of the Kolkata-based Sahara Utsarga Welfare Society, frustrated. He was convinced that politics was not his cup of tea, thanks to poor industrialisation in the state and rising poverty.  ',   ',   He established a not-for-profit entity instead, with a dream to make a difference in the lives of the poor. That was in 1996. In 1998, three years before Bandhan began its sojourn, Sudipta started giving micro loans especially to women.  ',   ',   Two decades hence, Sudipta is harnessing another dream: to set up a small finance bank in the districts where people were the most affected by pyramid money-collecting firms. Pyramid firms such as Saradha Realty or Rose Valley were largely active in the districts bordering Bangladesh \u2014 Malda, Murshidabad, Nadia, North 24 Parganas and South 24 Parganas.  ',   ',   Sahara Utsarga plans to primarily operate in these districts should it get a banking licence. The poor were the easiest prey for Ponzi firms as institutions failed to offer them a doorstep service.  ',   ',   The major challenge for Sahara Utsarga would be to mobilise Rs 100 crore, the minimum capital requirement for setting up a small finance bank. Mobilisation of small savings would give small finance banks access to lowcost funds.  ',   ',   "Our aim is to reduce lending by half to 12% a year on reducing balance. If we want to promote entrepreneurship among the poor, they need to get credit at an affordable cost," says Sudipta, a commerce graduate. Sahara Utsarga has Rs 60 crore as outstanding loans lent through 130 branches across West Bengal with a staff of 750.  ',   ',   ',     Eyes on the Road, Hands on the Wheel    ',     ',     Sunil Agarwal MD, SE Investments  ',   ',   ',   ',   ',   ',   ',   The moment someone mentions Agra, the first thing that comes to mind is the Taj Mahal. The beauty of the monument is quite in contrast with the congested, garbage-ridden town with many of its residents struggling to earn a living.  ',   ', u"  But in poverty lies the potential to build a fortune, according to management guru CK Prahlad's Bottom of the Pyramid management strategy. Sunil Agarwal, however, neither knew Prahlad, nor was he aware of any great management wisdom to begin a business. All that Agarwal knew was what he saw in the historic town of Agra \u2014 there were milling tourists, but not enough rickshaws to ferry them between bus stations and the monuments.  ",   ',   That was the opportunity Agarwal captured. Today , he aims to convert his finance company into a small bank. "There were rickshaw pullers, but not enough vehicles to meet the demand of tourists pouring into the town,'' says Agarwal (44), of SE Investments, which has applied for a small bank licence. "There weren't many small passenger vehicles to take tourists to Taj Mahal and nearby areas."  ',   ',   At the age of 21, when he went to his father with the idea of funding rickshaws, pat came the reply from the chartered accountant father, "What kind of a business is this?" Nevertheless, the Agarwals, with business running in their veins, helped with a funding of Rs 25 lakh in the 1990s. But one suggestion from his father was that he should list the firm so that someone watches the management constantly.  ',   ',   It notched up a revenue of Rs 16 lakh, and a net profit of Rs 6 lakh in 1995. So, SE became the first non-banking finance firm from Agra to list on th stock exchanges, claims Agarwal. It now has 21 foreign institutional investors, including Credit Suisse and Davos International, as shareholders.  ',   ',   How did he convince the investors? He carried the annual report of Housing Development Finance Corporation, the gold standard in corporate governance, as his Gita.  ',   ',   ',   ',     Breaking New Ground    ',     ',      ', Manish Khera',  FORMER MD & CEO, FINO  ',   ',   ',   ',   ',   ',   ',   ', u"  If you are a private banker these days, sugar, fertilizers, paper, and power are generally the untouchable sectors. But that's precisely where Manish Khera, an applicant for a small bank licence, cut his teeth.  ",   ', u"  In the early 1990s when the so-called new age private sector banks were beginning to find their feet, Khera, who joined ICICI's corporate banking straight from Faculty of Management Studies, Delhi, realised the future may lie in technology.  ",   ',   The stone age of banking \u2014 when banks still had monstrous ledgers being moved from table to table, and the only way for most people to withdraw money was to wait in the queue before the teller with a slip \u2014 provoked Khera to think how many hurdles in banking could be overcome. Many of these sectors, which depended on heavy subsidies from the government \u2014 and some still do \u2014 also opened the gates for him to interact with the administrators in New Delhi.  ',   ',   His desire to reduce the hassles of banking and government businesses in rural areas lit a spark in him. It ultimately resulted in him becoming the founding member of FINO \u2014 Financial Information Network and Operations, a technology based startup that took financial services to rural and underbanked segments. The firm was backed by ICICI, IFC, and later private equity firm Blackstone.  ',   ',   "Exposure to the government side of the business was the turning point," says Khera. In 1999, he went to Cambridge for a course in Environment and Development Studies on a one-year sabbatical. "It helped me form perspectives on issues around water, sanitation and climate change."  ',   ',   Back then, FINO was trying to enter the tax collection segment and introduced e-filing of returns. "We opened up this market through ICICI. It was an experience to work with the Reserve Bank of India, CBDT and CBEC. Online tax collection had gone up from Rs 0 to Rs 30,000 crore," said Khera.  ',   ', u"  He was involved with the government's initiative of online booking of railway tickets, which he recalls as an experience. Khera is gambling on his experience in areas where the regulator wants to train its focus. But few know what is in store.

In that context, the key question arises on ownership. The guidelines clearly favored Indian ownership and most of the applicants had this issue to resolve courtesy equity stakes by large investors most of whom are foreign. 

However, there are number of payment bank applicants like Vodafone or FINO Paytech or GI Technology or Citrus Payments that have substantial foreign holding and they have not declared how they are going to address this requirement. That means they are waiting for RBI to give them an in-principle license and then they would go in the market to rejig their shareholding. So in a way, when RBI does its fit-and-proper due-diligence, it does  not know whom it is assessing. Since the promoter or the largest shareholder is not even known now. Infact most of the current investors are looking at making a quick buck on this beautiful arbitrage opportunity that has been created in the process, especially in failing business models like FINO Paytech. Its an ideal candidate for back door entry, once it gets a license. 


That definitely is not going to happen. At least not in the RBI we all know. This is clearly a case of automatic disqualification. The promoter / shareholders have to be known upfront and have to stay that way for a defined lock-in period.

There are 72 applicants in the fray, but who will be the lucky ones? Atmadip Ray and Shilpy Sinha profile some of the applicants.  ",   ',   ',   ',     Kuldip Maity    ',     ',     Line-up Managing Director & CEO, Village Financial Services  ',   ',   ',   ',   ',   ',   ', u"  For some fnance companies, adding spice to business may be a way of life. For some, cooking up numbers could be the main business. But here's someone who wants to deliver the Planter's Punch \u2014 Kuldip Maity (37), the chief executive of Village Financial Services, who morphed into a financier from a hotelier.  ",   ',   Maity had to leave a career in the hospitality industry on the orders of his social worker father. In 1998, Ajit Kumar Maity lifted his son out of the world of cocktails to join Village Welfare Society, a not-for-profit entity engaged in women empowerment since 1982.  ',   ',   The group started micro lending in 1996. A decade later it acquired a local non-banking finance company and renamed it Village Financial Services.  ',   ', u"  Kuldip has been the CEO of the NBFC operation from the beginning and steered it to build a Rs 110-crore outstanding loan portfolio without any institutional equity or private equity support unlike most of his rivals. In his formative years as a professional, Kuldip had worked with Chandra Shekhar Ghosh, who was then the operation head in the country's first NBFC-MFI.  ",   ', u"  Ghosh left the group in 2000 to create Bandhan, which will take off as a universal bank. Over the past nine years, Village Financial has created a reasonable presence in the eastern region with 106 branches. Its network may look scanty when compared to Bandhan's formidable 2,022-strong branch network, but it is still the second largest MFI in ", West Bengal', u" in terms of branch network, ahead of Arohan with 104 and Jagaran Microfin's 50 branches.  ",   ', u"  Kuldip's Village Financial is also present in ", Assam',  and Bihar. It can be a serious contender for a small finance bank licence from the eastern zone along with Kolkatabased Jagaran Microfin and Guwahati-based RGVN (North East) ', Microfinance',  since the banking regulator said it would give preference to entities in the North East, East and Central regions, which are largely under-banked. ', RBI',  expects small finance banks to serve local people and local businesses for the first five years.  ',   ',   ',     Banking on Basics    ',     ',      ', Sanjay Agarwal',  MD, AU Financier  ',   ',   ',   ',   ',   ',   ',   ',   When ', HDFC Bank', u" was looking for a business correspondent \u2014 a relationship unit to build clientele in rural and semi-urban areas without opening a bank branch \u2014 it shortlisted Sanjay Agarwal of AU Financier. Making it into HDFC Bank's books was a stamp of approval for the investing community.  ",   ',   When top private equity firms such as Warburg Pincus, ChrysCapital and Kedaara Capital wanted a share of the growing pie of the financial services sector, the target was AU. There was no looking back for Agarwal \u2014 his profits grew to Rs 150 crore in 2014-15. Now that he has established the finance company, he has applied for a small bank licence.  ',   ',   What can be a more profitable business in a country where the geographical vastness makes transportation of goods difficult: Fund truck purchases. Behind Agarwal's decision to become a lender was no rocket science, but just a basic necessity of the economy. "The first loan of Rs 1.5 lakh was given to buy a Maruti Omni," says Agarwal. "We approached people who do not file IT returns in the three -wheeler commercial segment and they proved to be good risks," he says.  ',   ',   A chartered accountant, Agarwal ventured out in 1994 with borrowings from local jewellers, builders and even exporters to begin a finance company. But there was trouble \u2014 from the investors, regulators, and markets. That was a time when the CRB scandal, where a non-banking finance company founded by Chain Roop Bhansali, committed fraud leading to tightening of regulations and closure of hundreds of such firms.  ',   ', u"  Also, 'wealthy' individuals who are used to seeing their money double in months in stock markets and businesses, were unwilling to wait till Agarwal built his. That period was a learning \u2014 don't go aggressive in building the business, and do not rely on wealthy individuals. When HDFC Bank wanted AU to bring in more capital, Agarwal started looking for investors who could bring in long-term money.  ",   ', u"  HNIs didn't fit the bill. With the help of a friend, he got introduced to Vishal Tulsyan and Ramdeo Agarwal of Motilal Oswal, whose private equity fund invested in it. Then came International Finance Corporation, a member of the ", World Bank Group', , which turned its fortunes.  ',   ',   ',     Touching the Bottom of the Pyramid    ',     ',     Sudipta Banerjee, SECRETARY, ', Sahara Utsarga',  Welfare Society  ',   ',   ',   ',   ',   ',   When it comes to microfinance companies from West Bengal, the first name that comes to mind is Bandhan. But there were institutions which were into the business much before but did not scale up. Sudipta Banerjee, born into a family of politicians, need not think much about a career \u2014 just join the family business of politics. He did so, but disillusionment followed soon enough. Student politics had left Banerjee, the secretary of the Kolkata-based Sahara Utsarga Welfare Society, frustrated. He was convinced that politics was not his cup of tea, thanks to poor industrialisation in the state and rising poverty.  ',   ',   He established a not-for-profit entity instead, with a dream to make a difference in the lives of the poor. That was in 1996. In 1998, three years before Bandhan began its sojourn, Sudipta started giving micro loans especially to women.  ',   ',   Two decades hence, Sudipta is harnessing another dream: to set up a small finance bank in the districts where people were the most affected by pyramid money-collecting firms. Pyramid firms such as Saradha Realty or Rose Valley were largely active in the districts bordering Bangladesh \u2014 Malda, Murshidabad, Nadia, North 24 Parganas and South 24 Parganas.  ',   ',   Sahara Utsarga plans to primarily operate in these districts should it get a banking licence. The poor were the easiest prey for Ponzi firms as institutions failed to offer them a doorstep service.  ',   ',   The major challenge for Sahara Utsarga would be to mobilise Rs 100 crore, the minimum capital requirement for setting up a small finance bank. Mobilisation of small savings would give small finance banks access to lowcost funds.  ',   ',   "Our aim is to reduce lending by half to 12% a year on reducing balance. If we want to promote entrepreneurship among the poor, they need to get credit at an affordable cost," says Sudipta, a commerce graduate. Sahara Utsarga has Rs 60 crore as outstanding loans lent through 130 branches across West Bengal with a staff of 750.  ',   ',   ',     Eyes on the Road, Hands on the Wheel    ',     ',     Sunil Agarwal MD, SE Investments  ',   ',   ',   ',   ',   ',   ',   The moment someone mentions Agra, the first thing that comes to mind is the Taj Mahal. The beauty of the monument is quite in contrast with the congested, garbage-ridden town with many of its residents struggling to earn a living.  ',   ', u"  But in poverty lies the potential to build a fortune, according to management guru CK Prahlad's Bottom of the Pyramid management strategy. Sunil Agarwal, however, neither knew Prahlad, nor was he aware of any great management wisdom to begin a business. All that Agarwal knew was what he saw in the historic town of Agra \u2014 there were milling tourists, but not enough rickshaws to ferry them between bus stations and the monuments.  ",   ',   That was the opportunity Agarwal captured. Today , he aims to convert his finance company into a small bank. "There were rickshaw pullers, but not enough vehicles to meet the demand of tourists pouring into the town,'' says Agarwal (44), of SE Investments, which has applied for a small bank licence. "There weren't many small passenger vehicles to take tourists to Taj Mahal and nearby areas."  ',   ',   At the age of 21, when he went to his father with the idea of funding rickshaws, pat came the reply from the chartered accountant father, "What kind of a business is this?" Nevertheless, the Agarwals, with business running in their veins, helped with a funding of Rs 25 lakh in the 1990s. But one suggestion from his father was that he should list the firm so that someone watches the management constantly.  ',   ',   It notched up a revenue of Rs 16 lakh, and a net profit of Rs 6 lakh in 1995. So, SE became the first non-banking finance firm from Agra to list on th stock exchanges, claims Agarwal. It now has 21 foreign institutional investors, including Credit Suisse and Davos International, as shareholders.  ',   ',   How did he convince the investors? He carried the annual report of Housing Development Finance Corporation, the gold standard in corporate governance, as his Gita.  ',   ',   ',   ',     Breaking New Ground    ',     ',      ', Manish Khera',  FORMER MD & CEO, FINO  ',   ',   ',   ',   ',   ',   ',   ', u"  If you are a private banker these days, sugar, fertilizers, paper, and power are generally the untouchable sectors. But that's precisely where Manish Khera, an applicant for a small bank licence, cut his teeth.  ",   ', u"  In the early 1990s when the so-called new age private sector banks were beginning to find their feet, Khera, who joined ICICI's corporate banking straight from Faculty of Management Studies, Delhi, realised the future may lie in technology.  ",   ',   The stone age of banking \u2014 when banks still had monstrous ledgers being moved from table to table, and the only way for most people to withdraw money was to wait in the queue before the teller with a slip \u2014 provoked Khera to think how many hurdles in banking could be overcome. Many of these sectors, which depended on heavy subsidies from the government \u2014 and some still do \u2014 also opened the gates for him to interact with the administrators in New Delhi.  ',   ',   His desire to reduce the hassles of banking and government businesses in rural areas lit a spark in him. It ultimately resulted in him becoming the founding member of FINO \u2014 Financial Information Network and Operations, a technology based startup that took financial services to rural and underbanked segments. The firm was backed by ICICI, IFC, and later private equity firm Blackstone.  ',   ',   "Exposure to the government side of the business was the turning point," says Khera. In 1999, he went to Cambridge for a course in Environment and Development Studies on a one-year sabbatical. "It helped me form perspectives on issues around water, sanitation and climate change."  ',   ',   Back then, FINO was trying to enter the tax collection segment and introduced e-filing of returns. "We opened up this market through ICICI. It was an experience to work with the Reserve Bank of India, CBDT and CBEC. Online tax collection had gone up from Rs 0 to Rs 30,000 crore," said Khera.  ',   ', u"  He was involved with the government's initiative of online booking of railway tickets, which he recalls as an experience. Khera is gambling on his experience in areas where the regulator wants to train its focus. But few know what is in store.

In that context, the key question arises on ownership. The guidelines clearly favored Indian ownership and most of the applicants had this issue to resolve courtesy equity stakes by large investors most of whom are foreign. 

However, there are number of payment bank applicants like Vodafone or FINO Paytech or GI Technology or Citrus Payments that have substantial foreign holding and they have not declared how they are going to address this requirement. That means they are waiting for RBI to give them an in-principle license and then they would go in the market to rejig their shareholding. So in a way, when RBI does its fit-and-proper due-diligence, it does  not know whom it is assessing. Since the promoter or the largest shareholder is not even known now. Infact most of the current investors are looking at making a quick buck on this beautiful arbitrage opportunity that has been created in the process, especially in failing business models like FINO Paytech. Its an ideal candidate for back door entry, once it gets a license. 


That definitely is not going to happen. At least not in the RBI we all know. This is clearly a case of automatic disqualification. The promoter / shareholders have to be known upfront and have to stay that way for a defined lock-in period.
