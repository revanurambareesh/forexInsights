Over the decades, the Foundation\u2019s approach has evolved, first focusing on efforts to increase the wealth of farmers, then on improving the nutritional content of food and increasing the yield of staple crops, followed by catalyzing a uniquely African Green Revolution.',  ', 
', And now, the foundation is building on this work to address waste and loss in the food system, with the aim of demonstrating how we can reduce global food waste in half by 2030.',

Over the decades, the Foundation\u2019s approach has evolved, first focusing on efforts to increase the wealth of farmers, then on improving the nutritional content of food and increasing the yield of staple crops, followed by catalyzing a uniquely African Green Revolution.',  ', 
', And now, the foundation is building on this work to address waste and loss in the food system, with the aim of demonstrating how we can reduce global food waste in half by 2030.',
