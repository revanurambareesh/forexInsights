Biological systems are not simply collections of biochemical reactions or easily deconstructed morphological changes \u2013 they are complex systems with multiple driving forces. These forces range from the dipolar torque on biomolecules in the cytoplasm to the cyclic strain on fibroblasts in cardiac tissue, and need to be leveraged through re-engineering at each scale to make critical advances in treating disease. We have already improved our lives with more traditional study of disease, but we also need new approaches to generate future treatments. By working across fields and deconstructing biological systems using engineering approaches we can realize new treatments. We are uniquely positioned to lead this charge into the tangled web of biomechanics that drive biological systems.',  ',  As a mechanical engineer, I think about how biological systems work in the same way that I think about how engineered systems work. I have spent my life taking apart complex systems to gain an understanding of how they function, an activity that started in my youth with lawn mowers and cars, and now encompasses the cell\u2019s tremendously more advanced machinery. My engineering instincts lead me to explore how robots work, how satellites are constructed, and how energy is harnessed to power machines. Yet I am particularly fascinated by nature\u2019s machines, and I look to the intersection of biology and mechanical engineering as a source of discovery. I wonder: Do engineered, man-made systems have anything in common with the biological systems of nature? Can comparisons be drawn between the engineered machinery in satellites, robots, and solar-powered vehicles and the natural machinery of molecules, cells, and organisms? My answer is: yes. By envisioning cells and molecules as "engineered systems" that can be investigated with the same fundamental approaches used to understand man-made machines, we can uncover unifying principles between these systems in order to confront disease and create medical innovations. These biological systems can range from the mammalian cell to the microorganism (e.g., magnetotactic bacteria, energy generating bacteria, Xenopus laevis embryos, artificial cells, stem cells, plant cells, algae), and my team applies principles from across mechanical engineering (e.g., solid mechanics, control theory, fluidics, design) to understand diverse, nature-based systems and address disease. My goal is to build upon the foundation I have created in the first decade of my career to radically shift how disease is approached by deconstructing the mechanical and chemical environment driving tissue development and cellular integration, in order to leverage the forces and mechanics underlying disease into developing new treatments and starting companies in areas such as malnutrition and bioenergy.',  ',

Biological systems are not simply collections of biochemical reactions or easily deconstructed morphological changes \u2013 they are complex systems with multiple driving forces. These forces range from the dipolar torque on biomolecules in the cytoplasm to the cyclic strain on fibroblasts in cardiac tissue, and need to be leveraged through re-engineering at each scale to make critical advances in treating disease. We have already improved our lives with more traditional study of disease, but we also need new approaches to generate future treatments. By working across fields and deconstructing biological systems using engineering approaches we can realize new treatments. We are uniquely positioned to lead this charge into the tangled web of biomechanics that drive biological systems.',  ',  As a mechanical engineer, I think about how biological systems work in the same way that I think about how engineered systems work. I have spent my life taking apart complex systems to gain an understanding of how they function, an activity that started in my youth with lawn mowers and cars, and now encompasses the cell\u2019s tremendously more advanced machinery. My engineering instincts lead me to explore how robots work, how satellites are constructed, and how energy is harnessed to power machines. Yet I am particularly fascinated by nature\u2019s machines, and I look to the intersection of biology and mechanical engineering as a source of discovery. I wonder: Do engineered, man-made systems have anything in common with the biological systems of nature? Can comparisons be drawn between the engineered machinery in satellites, robots, and solar-powered vehicles and the natural machinery of molecules, cells, and organisms? My answer is: yes. By envisioning cells and molecules as "engineered systems" that can be investigated with the same fundamental approaches used to understand man-made machines, we can uncover unifying principles between these systems in order to confront disease and create medical innovations. These biological systems can range from the mammalian cell to the microorganism (e.g., magnetotactic bacteria, energy generating bacteria, Xenopus laevis embryos, artificial cells, stem cells, plant cells, algae), and my team applies principles from across mechanical engineering (e.g., solid mechanics, control theory, fluidics, design) to understand diverse, nature-based systems and address disease. My goal is to build upon the foundation I have created in the first decade of my career to radically shift how disease is approached by deconstructing the mechanical and chemical environment driving tissue development and cellular integration, in order to leverage the forces and mechanics underlying disease into developing new treatments and starting companies in areas such as malnutrition and bioenergy.',  ',
