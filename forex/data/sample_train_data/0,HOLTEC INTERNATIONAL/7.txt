        ', Officials gathered at the southern end of the Camden waterfront on Wednesday to break ground on the much anticipated Holtec International project.', 
        ', The project, which calls for a 600,000-square-foot manufacturing and technology center, was approved last year for $260 million in incentives by the Economic Development Authority. Holtec will also be making a capital investment of $260 million, which officials hailed as the largest single private investment in the city\u2019s history.', 
', \u201cToday, we are all bearing witness to Camden\u2019s real transformation,\u201d said Mayor Dana Redd. \u201cThe city is proud to welcome Holtec International as our new world-class business partner. Holtec is not only committed to building a state-of-the-art technology and manufacturing facility, they are ready and willing to build human capital by proving real job opportunities for Camden residents.\u201d', 
', Holtec President Kris Singh said the future facility will be a \u201ccathedral of industry.\u201d', 
', \u201cWe are acutely aware of our social responsibility,\u201d said Singh. \u201cWe will work with the state of New Jersey and the city of Camden to leverage our plant to serve as a training academy to help young men and women, especially unemployed Camden residents and veterans, to acquire skills that yield well-paying jobs. Our center also serves to signal the renaissance of manufacturing in the United States powered by private enterprise.\u201d', 
', Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno called the project\u2019s development a \u201cstrong new day for Camden.\u201d She said she had personally worked on the project for the last five years.', 
', \u201cIt is incredibly satisfying to be here to see the largest single investment ever in Camden start to come to life,\u201d Guadagno said. \u201cWe will continue working toward this city\u2019s renewal, with projects like Holtec\u2019s technology campus. Today, we celebrate not only hundreds of new and retained jobs, but also Holtec\u2019s commitment to the Camden community and its continued presence in New Jersey\u2019s innovation ecosystem.\u201d', 
', U.S. Rep. Donald Norcross (D-Camden) said that Holtec is the \u201cperfect partner\u201d for the city to reestablish itself as a manufacturing hub.', 
', \u201cOn the same site where the New York Shipyard built the first nuclear powered merchant ship, Holtec will now build the next generation of clean, reliable, carbon-free energy,\u201d Norcross said.',

        ', Officials gathered at the southern end of the Camden waterfront on Wednesday to break ground on the much anticipated Holtec International project.', 
        ', The project, which calls for a 600,000-square-foot manufacturing and technology center, was approved last year for $260 million in incentives by the Economic Development Authority. Holtec will also be making a capital investment of $260 million, which officials hailed as the largest single private investment in the city\u2019s history.', 
', \u201cToday, we are all bearing witness to Camden\u2019s real transformation,\u201d said Mayor Dana Redd. \u201cThe city is proud to welcome Holtec International as our new world-class business partner. Holtec is not only committed to building a state-of-the-art technology and manufacturing facility, they are ready and willing to build human capital by proving real job opportunities for Camden residents.\u201d', 
', Holtec President Kris Singh said the future facility will be a \u201ccathedral of industry.\u201d', 
', \u201cWe are acutely aware of our social responsibility,\u201d said Singh. \u201cWe will work with the state of New Jersey and the city of Camden to leverage our plant to serve as a training academy to help young men and women, especially unemployed Camden residents and veterans, to acquire skills that yield well-paying jobs. Our center also serves to signal the renaissance of manufacturing in the United States powered by private enterprise.\u201d', 
', Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno called the project\u2019s development a \u201cstrong new day for Camden.\u201d She said she had personally worked on the project for the last five years.', 
', \u201cIt is incredibly satisfying to be here to see the largest single investment ever in Camden start to come to life,\u201d Guadagno said. \u201cWe will continue working toward this city\u2019s renewal, with projects like Holtec\u2019s technology campus. Today, we celebrate not only hundreds of new and retained jobs, but also Holtec\u2019s commitment to the Camden community and its continued presence in New Jersey\u2019s innovation ecosystem.\u201d', 
', U.S. Rep. Donald Norcross (D-Camden) said that Holtec is the \u201cperfect partner\u201d for the city to reestablish itself as a manufacturing hub.', 
', \u201cOn the same site where the New York Shipyard built the first nuclear powered merchant ship, Holtec will now build the next generation of clean, reliable, carbon-free energy,\u201d Norcross said.',
