Experts:',   ',   ',   ', ET Now: NBCC has got the inprincipal approval to acquire Hindustan Steelworks Construction. Give us more details of this company, how is this going to benefit you?',   ',   ',   ', Anoop K Mittal:',   Hindustan Steelworks Ltd. is a company under the ministry of steel. Primarily it was constituted for steel projects, but in last decade they were primarily in EPC contract - 75 per cent business was coming from EPC, PMC business and 25 per cent from steel plants. But this company is under heavy debt. The amount for ', VRS',  Scheme for their employees was paid by government of India and some banks.  ',   Our board has approved that NBCC is willing to take over the company after their balance sheet is restructured, their government loans along with interest are waived off and the provision for bank loan and interest and other contingent liability should be made by government. So once balance sheet is clean, there is hardly any debt NBCC will take over.  ',   ',   This company has order book of about Rs 8,200 crore as per their last report and is doing an average Rs 1,500 crore turnover over the last three years with a operating margin of 7 per cent which is about 100 crore. The company is in loss because of interest burden and once the restructuring is done, NBCC will benefit with the Rs 8200 crore order book with additional turnover average of 1500 crore which we will definitely increase once it comes to NBCC fold.  ',   ',   ', ET Now: Can you take us through current financials of the company and what is the amount that you are paying?',   ',   ',   ', Anoop K Mittal:',   NBCC board has approved and requested for restructuring which means NBCC will not take burden of any loan and interest part of the company except may be few crores rupees. I cannot reveal numbers but it will be very negligible amount. The bottom line is that NBCC will take over once it is restructured and interest and loans are waived off. NBCC investment will be hardly anything in this company.  ',   ',   ', ET Now: It is definitely looking good in terms of acquisition. A lot of brokerages are saying that they see your order book growing 1.5 times from Rs 35,000 crore to Rs 60,000 crore till FY18. What are the internal estimates that you are working with?',   ',   ',   ', Anoop K Mittal:', u"  I am inclined to agree to brokers' report that present order book is about Rs 40,000 crore and we have acquired almost Rs 25,000 crore orders from different clients in this financial year. Many orders are in discussion with the clients and I hope in coming financial year most of them will be approved by government. So it may cross Rs 60,000 crores also by FY18.  ",   ',   ', ET Now: How do you see growth for the PMC segment and what is the way ahead for redevelopment projects?',   ',   ',   ', Anoop K Mittal:',   The main projects in our order book are from redevelopment projects, which falls under PMC segment. We have planned minimum 25 per cent CAGR growth for the next five years in the top line and bottom line almost near to that. 25 per cent CAGR is a very conservative figure considering the order book and future order book. It will definitely increase but right now this is the figure which we are revealing. This growth rate will increase after three months or six months, once the order book is converted into income and projects are started.  ',   ',   ', ET Now: What is your total cash on books right now and what is the strategy for the deployment of cash?',   ',   ',   ', Anoop K Mittal:', u"  We have two types of cash in our banks and balance sheet: one is client deposit which they deposit in PMC projects because of that company's negative working capital and another thing is our own cash which is about Rs 300-350 crore rupees. Some amount we have already invested in our ongoing real estate projects. So 900 plus 350 is right now approximate figure of cash available. HSCL also has some cash in their balance sheet, again negative working capital. That company is doing similar kind of jobs which NBCC does. So that is another advantage for NBCC.
