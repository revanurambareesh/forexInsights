Temasek will be an independent co-investor alongside Advent in CGCEL.', 
', CGCEL will be demerged from CG into a standalone company and will consequently be listed on the National Stock Exchange of India (\u201cNSE\u201d) and Bombay Stock Exchange (\u201cBSE\u201d). Thereafter, Advent, a global private equity firm with a dedicated presence in India, and Temasek, an investment company based in Singapore, will make an open offer for additional shares of CGCEL in compliance with takeover regulations. The transaction values CGCEL at an enterprise value of INR 66 billion (US$1.07 billion). The transaction is subject to closing conditions and receipt of all statutory and other approvals, including the successful demerger of CGCEL from CG and approval from the Reserve Bank of India and Competition Commission of India.', 
', CGCEL, one of CG\u2019s largest and fastest-growing businesses, manufactures and markets a wide spectrum of consumer products, ranging from fans, lamps and luminaires to pumps and household appliances such as water heaters, mixer grinders, toasters, irons and electric lanterns.

It employs approximately 3,500 people and has six manufacturing facilities.', 
', \u201cAfter an extensive search and careful evaluation, Avantha is pleased to have signed a share purchase agreement for the sale of its stake in Crompton Greaves\u2019 consumer business,\u201d said Gautam Thapar, Founder and Chairman of the Avantha Group. \u201cBoth Advent and Temasek have extensive financial, sector and operational expertise, and we believe they are well-positioned to support CGCEL in its next phase of growth.

', CG had filed with the BSE on March 3, 2015, regarding the demerger of CG\u2019s consumer business into CGCEL, whereby all of CG\u2019s shareholders will receive shares of CGCEL such that the shareholding of CGCEL upon completion of the demerger will mirror the shareholding of CG.', 
', 
CGCEL\u2019s growth and consumer product market growth', 
', CGCEL has grown at a compound rate of 16% per year over the past six years and generated revenue of INR 28.5 billion (US$459 million) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014. The business has benefited from robust long-term growth in the Indian consumer products market, where sales volume has increased approximately 1.5 to 1.9 times India\u2019s real gross domestic product (GDP) from 2002 to 2014. With India\u2019s GDP growth expected to accelerate in the coming years, prospects for the country\u2019s consumer segment remain strong.', 
', \u201cAs a standalone company, CGCEL would be able to pursue more strategic goals and thus maximize value for all its stakeholders,\u201d said Laurent Demortier, CEO and Managing Director of CG. \u201cI would like to thank our colleagues in the consumer products business for their commitment and achievements, and I am confident that they will continue to benefit as the business pursues further growth in India and beyond.\u201d',
