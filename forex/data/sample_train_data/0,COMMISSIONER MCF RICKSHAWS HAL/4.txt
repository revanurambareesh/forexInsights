        In order to ensure the safety and security of the women working in the BPO sector, Haryana ADGP-cum-Gurgaon police commissioner SS Deswal has sent some guidelines to the BPO companies, transporters and security agencies.
', Deswal has directed the BPOs to keep a dedicated command centre or control room with an emergency telephone number operational round the clock at which the employees can call in case of any untoward incident. ', As per the guidelines, a dedicated emergency cab should also be deployed round the clock, which can be used in case of emergency. The company management should tell the transporter/security agency to ensure that the antecedents of all drivers/security guards have been verified. ', The drivers and guards should have proper identity cards, the guidelines maintain, adding that the drivers should be asked to pick women employees from their doorstep and wait till they have safely entered their house. ', "The security guards must accompany the woman employees to their house in case the cab cannot reach their residence," the Commissioner said and added that the transporter and the BPOs should ensure that the cabs do not have black films or tinted glasses. ', The company should inform the employee about the vehicle number, name of the driver and security guard in the vehicle. A team for conducting surprise check should also be constituted to ensure that security measures were being adhered to. ', The guidelines maintain that in case of non-compliance, a clause of heavy fine should be there in the contract with the transporter and security agencies.', They further state that the employer should maintain a complaint mechanism, including a complaint committee headed by a woman and comprising women members in equal strength. ', u"Besides, the women employees should be employed only in batches, of not less than 10 or two-third of the total night shift's strength. ", A sticker bearing the name and telephone number(s) of the employer should be prominently displayed on the cabs. Asking the companies to maintain a database of all its employees, the Police Commissioner asserted that the police should have access to the database at any time.',

Gurgaon, December 16', 

        The women in this satellite town of the national Capital who use public transport can now feel safe as the police has started exclusive autorickshaws for women. 
', These autos will be pink coloured so that they can be identified easily. ', The Gurgaon police has taken the step after a 30-year-old woman working in a BPO here was abducted from Dhaula Kuan in Delhi and gangraped in a moving goods carrier last month. ', Gurgaon police commissioner S.S. Deswal was on Wednesday present with police heads of all the nearby states in the inter-state coordination meeting at the Delhi police headquarters where the strategy to ensure security for working women, especially in Gurgaon and Delhi, was discussed.', "Twelve autos, especially for women, are being introduced first and if the need is felt, more such autos will be deployed in Gurgaon. Drivers verified with the Gurgaon police will run these." ', "Initially, these autos will operate from Metro stations in Gurgaon to major destinations inside Cyber City," Deswal said. ', The Gurgaon police is also open to the idea that female drivers operate these autos. ', Initially, this facility will be available at four Metro stations.', "There have been complaints of eve-teasing when women travel with men in crowded autos. To make sure that women feel safe while travelling to work and back home, we have introduced these autos," a police officer said. ', The Delhi Metro recently earmarked one coach exclusively for women in its trains.', Geetika, a resident of the Millennium City, said: "It is a good initiative taken by the Gurgaon police. At least the police is concerned about our safety. I am sure it will help us."',

 The demolition drive of the Municipal Corporation of Faridabad (MCF) has terrorised the land mafias, compelling them to join hands. 
', The joint commissioner, MCF, Old Faridabad Zone, Mukesh Kumar Solanki today reiterated that the civic body would not spare anyone found guilty of encroaching on public land or indulging in unauthorised construction. ', The demolition squad of the MCF yesterday demolished boundary walls of four well-known banquet halls, including the one by the name Bill Gate, set up illegally on more than four acres. ', All the banquet halls were located along the Surajkund Road. ', The banquet halls were set up on forest area and Controlled Area of the MCF. ', The three other banquet halls that yesterday faced action are Vaishali, Rose and Lovely. All of them encompassed areas ranging from one to two acres and were doing booming business. ', More than 150 police personnel headed by two assistant commissioners of police had accompanied the demolition squad of the MCF. ', Besides, the squad demolished more than 100 jhuggis and encroachments on about 15 acres of MCF land in Sarai Khwaja. ', Apart from the jhuggis, land mafia had set up two shops in the area, which were also demolished by the MCF. Further, the demolition squad also razed eight shops in the Sarai Khawaj area. ', According to the MCF personnel, the present action is being taken against those who are continuing with illegal acts in spite of notices issued to them. ', Sources in the MCF say that the civic body has already prepared blueprints of more demolitions to be undertaken shortly. ', The targets are being kept a guarded secret by the civic body. ', Although the MCF action has come in for plaudits, many wonder why the culprits were not arrested. ', The general apprehension is that in the absence of arrests and other stringent actions, the culprits would again reconstruct their demolished establishments. ', Meanwhile, the land mafias who are under threat because of the tough stand of the MCF, have joined hands. ', However, it remains to be seen if the MCF slows down its operation or continues the pace. ',

        There's a famous saying that it's better to light a candle than to curse the darkness. Hence, if the chaos on Gurgaon's roads frustrates you and you strongly feel that some immediate action is required to improve traffic management, here's an opportunity to get actively involved in the city's traffic management system. 
", The Gurgaon Traffic Police authorities have invited residents to become part of a team of traffic volunteers, being formed with support from members of public. ', Owing to the acute shortage of manpower, the local police authorities have decided to seek active support of local residents and make them partners in traffic management in response to public demand for action and improved conditions on Gurgaon roads.', "We are looking for volunteers who are willing to put in a minimum of 2 hours a week at time convenient to them. With the efforts of traffic volunteers put together with our own staff, we will be able to achieve far greater results in our clampdown on traffic offenders," said Gurgaon DCP (Traffic) Bharti Arora in a statement issued here today. ', She appealed to the people to come forward and help make Gurgaon a better city to live - and commute - in. ', "We wish to target those who disobey red lights, block the flow of traffic by stopping in the wrong lane, use mobile phones while driving and violate other traffic rules and/or indulge in rash driving," Arora said, adding that active help and support from the public could play a great role in effective implementation of traffic safety rules.', "If you think it is time to move on from being an armchair critic to making a real difference with some real and tangible contribution, then this is the time to come forward and volunteer," she maintained.', The residents interested to serve as traffic volunteers can enroll themselves by sending an email at dcp.trafficggn@hry.nic.in or contact tel no. 0124-2217015 or sms on 09219592195 by typing @GTP followed by their details.', u"Besides traffic volunteers, Arora has also appealed to the people that in case they witness any traffic offence and are in a position to photograph the same, they should e-mail the details of the vehicle number, venue and time of offence along with photograph to dcp.trafficggn@hry.nic.in or post on the Gurgaon Traffic Police's facebook page or send by post to DCP Traffic office, Sector 51.", She said if anybody sees any corrupt traffic policeman who demands a bribe instead of issuing a challan with a receipt, he/she should report it through e-mail, post or telephone. ',

        The Supreme Court today took the DDA to task for demolishing two of the 64 night shelters that were built the last year at its instance and directed the authority to rebuild them within three days.
', A Bench comprising justices Dalveer Bhandari and Deepak Verma issued the order, after taking suo motu notice of news reports on the demolition of two shelters in the Nehru Place and Kalkaji areas, leaving the homeless out in the biting chill.', u"The Bench said that as a welfare state, it was the government's duty to ensure that not a single citizen across the country slept in the open when the weather was so harsh.", "We are greatly disappointed and astonished as to how the authorities could be so insensitive, impervious and callous when the winter is so intense," the Bench said.', The Bench directed the DDA to take disciplinary action against the officials responsible for pulling down the shelters. It was restraining itself from initiating contempt of court proceedings against the top brass of the agency, the Bench said.', u"Additional solicitor general Mohan Parasaran should visit one of the night shelters to assess the condition prevailing there, it ruled. Senior counsel Colin Gonsalves, appearing for the PIL petitioner, People's Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), said only 25 of the night shelters were operational, supporting his contention with photographs.",

        In order to ensure the safety and security of the women working in the BPO sector, Haryana ADGP-cum-Gurgaon police commissioner SS Deswal has sent some guidelines to the BPO companies, transporters and security agencies.
', Deswal has directed the BPOs to keep a dedicated command centre or control room with an emergency telephone number operational round the clock at which the employees can call in case of any untoward incident. ', As per the guidelines, a dedicated emergency cab should also be deployed round the clock, which can be used in case of emergency. The company management should tell the transporter/security agency to ensure that the antecedents of all drivers/security guards have been verified. ', The drivers and guards should have proper identity cards, the guidelines maintain, adding that the drivers should be asked to pick women employees from their doorstep and wait till they have safely entered their house. ', "The security guards must accompany the woman employees to their house in case the cab cannot reach their residence," the Commissioner said and added that the transporter and the BPOs should ensure that the cabs do not have black films or tinted glasses. ', The company should inform the employee about the vehicle number, name of the driver and security guard in the vehicle. A team for conducting surprise check should also be constituted to ensure that security measures were being adhered to. ', The guidelines maintain that in case of non-compliance, a clause of heavy fine should be there in the contract with the transporter and security agencies.', They further state that the employer should maintain a complaint mechanism, including a complaint committee headed by a woman and comprising women members in equal strength. ', u"Besides, the women employees should be employed only in batches, of not less than 10 or two-third of the total night shift's strength. ", A sticker bearing the name and telephone number(s) of the employer should be prominently displayed on the cabs. Asking the companies to maintain a database of all its employees, the Police Commissioner asserted that the police should have access to the database at any time.',

Gurgaon, December 16', 

        The women in this satellite town of the national Capital who use public transport can now feel safe as the police has started exclusive autorickshaws for women. 
', These autos will be pink coloured so that they can be identified easily. ', The Gurgaon police has taken the step after a 30-year-old woman working in a BPO here was abducted from Dhaula Kuan in Delhi and gangraped in a moving goods carrier last month. ', Gurgaon police commissioner S.S. Deswal was on Wednesday present with police heads of all the nearby states in the inter-state coordination meeting at the Delhi police headquarters where the strategy to ensure security for working women, especially in Gurgaon and Delhi, was discussed.', "Twelve autos, especially for women, are being introduced first and if the need is felt, more such autos will be deployed in Gurgaon. Drivers verified with the Gurgaon police will run these." ', "Initially, these autos will operate from Metro stations in Gurgaon to major destinations inside Cyber City," Deswal said. ', The Gurgaon police is also open to the idea that female drivers operate these autos. ', Initially, this facility will be available at four Metro stations.', "There have been complaints of eve-teasing when women travel with men in crowded autos. To make sure that women feel safe while travelling to work and back home, we have introduced these autos," a police officer said. ', The Delhi Metro recently earmarked one coach exclusively for women in its trains.', Geetika, a resident of the Millennium City, said: "It is a good initiative taken by the Gurgaon police. At least the police is concerned about our safety. I am sure it will help us."',

 The demolition drive of the Municipal Corporation of Faridabad (MCF) has terrorised the land mafias, compelling them to join hands. 
', The joint commissioner, MCF, Old Faridabad Zone, Mukesh Kumar Solanki today reiterated that the civic body would not spare anyone found guilty of encroaching on public land or indulging in unauthorised construction. ', The demolition squad of the MCF yesterday demolished boundary walls of four well-known banquet halls, including the one by the name Bill Gate, set up illegally on more than four acres. ', All the banquet halls were located along the Surajkund Road. ', The banquet halls were set up on forest area and Controlled Area of the MCF. ', The three other banquet halls that yesterday faced action are Vaishali, Rose and Lovely. All of them encompassed areas ranging from one to two acres and were doing booming business. ', More than 150 police personnel headed by two assistant commissioners of police had accompanied the demolition squad of the MCF. ', Besides, the squad demolished more than 100 jhuggis and encroachments on about 15 acres of MCF land in Sarai Khwaja. ', Apart from the jhuggis, land mafia had set up two shops in the area, which were also demolished by the MCF. Further, the demolition squad also razed eight shops in the Sarai Khawaj area. ', According to the MCF personnel, the present action is being taken against those who are continuing with illegal acts in spite of notices issued to them. ', Sources in the MCF say that the civic body has already prepared blueprints of more demolitions to be undertaken shortly. ', The targets are being kept a guarded secret by the civic body. ', Although the MCF action has come in for plaudits, many wonder why the culprits were not arrested. ', The general apprehension is that in the absence of arrests and other stringent actions, the culprits would again reconstruct their demolished establishments. ', Meanwhile, the land mafias who are under threat because of the tough stand of the MCF, have joined hands. ', However, it remains to be seen if the MCF slows down its operation or continues the pace. ',

        There's a famous saying that it's better to light a candle than to curse the darkness. Hence, if the chaos on Gurgaon's roads frustrates you and you strongly feel that some immediate action is required to improve traffic management, here's an opportunity to get actively involved in the city's traffic management system. 
", The Gurgaon Traffic Police authorities have invited residents to become part of a team of traffic volunteers, being formed with support from members of public. ', Owing to the acute shortage of manpower, the local police authorities have decided to seek active support of local residents and make them partners in traffic management in response to public demand for action and improved conditions on Gurgaon roads.', "We are looking for volunteers who are willing to put in a minimum of 2 hours a week at time convenient to them. With the efforts of traffic volunteers put together with our own staff, we will be able to achieve far greater results in our clampdown on traffic offenders," said Gurgaon DCP (Traffic) Bharti Arora in a statement issued here today. ', She appealed to the people to come forward and help make Gurgaon a better city to live - and commute - in. ', "We wish to target those who disobey red lights, block the flow of traffic by stopping in the wrong lane, use mobile phones while driving and violate other traffic rules and/or indulge in rash driving," Arora said, adding that active help and support from the public could play a great role in effective implementation of traffic safety rules.', "If you think it is time to move on from being an armchair critic to making a real difference with some real and tangible contribution, then this is the time to come forward and volunteer," she maintained.', The residents interested to serve as traffic volunteers can enroll themselves by sending an email at dcp.trafficggn@hry.nic.in or contact tel no. 0124-2217015 or sms on 09219592195 by typing @GTP followed by their details.', u"Besides traffic volunteers, Arora has also appealed to the people that in case they witness any traffic offence and are in a position to photograph the same, they should e-mail the details of the vehicle number, venue and time of offence along with photograph to dcp.trafficggn@hry.nic.in or post on the Gurgaon Traffic Police's facebook page or send by post to DCP Traffic office, Sector 51.", She said if anybody sees any corrupt traffic policeman who demands a bribe instead of issuing a challan with a receipt, he/she should report it through e-mail, post or telephone. ',

        The Supreme Court today took the DDA to task for demolishing two of the 64 night shelters that were built the last year at its instance and directed the authority to rebuild them within three days.
', A Bench comprising justices Dalveer Bhandari and Deepak Verma issued the order, after taking suo motu notice of news reports on the demolition of two shelters in the Nehru Place and Kalkaji areas, leaving the homeless out in the biting chill.', u"The Bench said that as a welfare state, it was the government's duty to ensure that not a single citizen across the country slept in the open when the weather was so harsh.", "We are greatly disappointed and astonished as to how the authorities could be so insensitive, impervious and callous when the winter is so intense," the Bench said.', The Bench directed the DDA to take disciplinary action against the officials responsible for pulling down the shelters. It was restraining itself from initiating contempt of court proceedings against the top brass of the agency, the Bench said.', u"Additional solicitor general Mohan Parasaran should visit one of the night shelters to assess the condition prevailing there, it ruled. Senior counsel Colin Gonsalves, appearing for the PIL petitioner, People's Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), said only 25 of the night shelters were operational, supporting his contention with photographs.",
