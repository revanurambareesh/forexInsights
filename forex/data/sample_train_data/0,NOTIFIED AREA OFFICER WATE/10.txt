			', BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) \u2014 One of the three officers killed after a shooting in Baton Rouge Sunday has been identified.', 
', Louisiana state representative said Montrell Jackson is among the officers fatally shot by the suspect, who has been identified as 29-year-old Gavin Long. Jackson leaves behind a four-month-old child.', 
', Police have confirmed that Long is dead and officials believe two others are still at large.', 
', Casey Rayborn Hicks, a spokeswoman for the East Baton Rouge Sheriff\u2019s Office, said in a statement that the public should call 911 immediately if they see anything suspicious.', 
', The shooting \u2014 which happened just before 9 a.m., less than 1 mile from police headquarters \u2014 comes amid spiraling tensions across the city \u2014 and the country \u2014 between the black community and police. The races of the suspect or suspects and the officers were not immediately known.', 
', Baton Rouge Police Sgt. Don Coppola told The Associated Press earlier that the officers were rushed to a local hospital. Coppola said authorities are asking people to stay away from the area.', 
', Multiple police units were stationed at Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center, where stricken officers were believed to be undergoing treatment at a trauma center. A police officer with a long gun was blocking the parking lot at the emergency room.', 
', Officers and deputies from the Baton Rouge Police Department and East Baton Rouge Sheriff\u2019s Office were involved, according to Hicks.', 
', An Associated Press reporter on the scene saw police vehicles with lights flashing massed about a half mile from the police headquarters on Airline Highway. Police armed with long guns on the road stopped at least two vehicles driving away from the scene and checked their trunks and vehicles before allowing them to drive away.', 
', Police-community relations in Baton Rouge have been especially tense since the killing of 37-year-old Alton Sterling, a black man killed by white officers earlier this month after a scuffle at a convenience store. The killing was captured on cellphone video and circulated widely on the internet.', 
', It was followed a day later by the shooting death of another black man in Minnesota, whose girlfriend livestreamed the aftermath of his death on Facebook. Then on Thursday, a black gunman in Dallas opened fire on police at a protest about the police shootings, killing five officers and heightening tensions even further.', 
', Over the weekend', , thousands of people took to the streets in Baton Rouge to condemn Sterling\u2019s death', , including hundreds of demonstrators who congregated outside the police station. Authorities arrested about 200 people over the three-day weekend.', 
', Michelle Rogers, 56, said the pastor at her church had led prayers Sunday for Sterling\u2019s family and police officers, asking members of the congregation to stand up if they knew an officer.', 
', Rogers said an officer in the congregation hastily left the church near the end of the service, and a pastor announced that \u201csomething had happened.\u201d', 
', \u201cBut he didn\u2019t say what. Then we started getting texts about officers down,\u201d she said.', 
', Rogers and her husband drove near the scene, but were blocked at an intersection closed down by police.', 
', \u201cI can\u2019t explain what brought us here,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just said a prayer in the car for the families.\u201d',

			', BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) \u2014 One of the three officers killed after a shooting in Baton Rouge Sunday has been identified.', 
', Louisiana state representative said Montrell Jackson is among the officers fatally shot by the suspect, who has been identified as 29-year-old Gavin Long. Jackson leaves behind a four-month-old child.', 
', Police have confirmed that Long is dead and officials believe two others are still at large.', 
', Casey Rayborn Hicks, a spokeswoman for the East Baton Rouge Sheriff\u2019s Office, said in a statement that the public should call 911 immediately if they see anything suspicious.', 
', The shooting \u2014 which happened just before 9 a.m., less than 1 mile from police headquarters \u2014 comes amid spiraling tensions across the city \u2014 and the country \u2014 between the black community and police. The races of the suspect or suspects and the officers were not immediately known.', 
', Baton Rouge Police Sgt. Don Coppola told The Associated Press earlier that the officers were rushed to a local hospital. Coppola said authorities are asking people to stay away from the area.', 
', Multiple police units were stationed at Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center, where stricken officers were believed to be undergoing treatment at a trauma center. A police officer with a long gun was blocking the parking lot at the emergency room.', 
', Officers and deputies from the Baton Rouge Police Department and East Baton Rouge Sheriff\u2019s Office were involved, according to Hicks.', 
', An Associated Press reporter on the scene saw police vehicles with lights flashing massed about a half mile from the police headquarters on Airline Highway. Police armed with long guns on the road stopped at least two vehicles driving away from the scene and checked their trunks and vehicles before allowing them to drive away.', 
', Police-community relations in Baton Rouge have been especially tense since the killing of 37-year-old Alton Sterling, a black man killed by white officers earlier this month after a scuffle at a convenience store. The killing was captured on cellphone video and circulated widely on the internet.', 
', It was followed a day later by the shooting death of another black man in Minnesota, whose girlfriend livestreamed the aftermath of his death on Facebook. Then on Thursday, a black gunman in Dallas opened fire on police at a protest about the police shootings, killing five officers and heightening tensions even further.', 
', Over the weekend', , thousands of people took to the streets in Baton Rouge to condemn Sterling\u2019s death', , including hundreds of demonstrators who congregated outside the police station. Authorities arrested about 200 people over the three-day weekend.', 
', Michelle Rogers, 56, said the pastor at her church had led prayers Sunday for Sterling\u2019s family and police officers, asking members of the congregation to stand up if they knew an officer.', 
', Rogers said an officer in the congregation hastily left the church near the end of the service, and a pastor announced that \u201csomething had happened.\u201d', 
', \u201cBut he didn\u2019t say what. Then we started getting texts about officers down,\u201d she said.', 
', Rogers and her husband drove near the scene, but were blocked at an intersection closed down by police.', 
', \u201cI can\u2019t explain what brought us here,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just said a prayer in the car for the families.\u201d',
