', Ngororero, December 1, 2016 - Residents of Ngororero District are set to benefit from a United Nations project aimed at strengthening human security, enhancing resilience and improving disaster risk management of high-risk communities and most vulnerable populations.', 

', The project \u2013 ', \u2018Strengthening human security by enhancing resilience to natural disasters and climate-related threats in Ngororero District,\u2019',  is mainly implemented by the Ministry of Disaster Management and Refugee Affairs (MIDIMAR), the Rwanda Biomedical Center of the Ministry of Health, the Water and Sanitation Corporation (WASAC) and Ngororero District authorities.', 

', Permanent houses in Kabaya sector have been provided to eleven landslide-vulnerable families through the project.', 

', Minister Mukanatabana Seraphine advised the residents of Kabaya to move from high risk zones to safer villages for their safety and easy access to government services. \u201cI thank those who have listened to government and moved to this village and also congratulate those that are moving into these safe houses. Use them efficiently for your families and also encourage others who are still living in high risk zones to shift and join you in this safe village. Through solar energy, you will be able to receive electricity, something you might not enjoy in high risk zones,\u201d she said.', 

', She also noted that disasters are a major obstacle to achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs), and can at times erase major development gains achieved over the years.', 

', Mehrnaz Mostafavi, the head of Human Security Unit at the UN headquarters, said UN agencies are committed to work with government to ensure comprehensive, protection and empowerment relief to those affected by natural disasters. She said climate change is the leading cause of disasters in Rwanda.', 

', \u201cHuman security challenges as a result of climate \u2013 induced hazards such as floods and droughts, have affected more than two million people in the past two decades. The UN Trust Fund for Human Security is proud support this ongoing programme in western Rwanda,\u201d she said.', 

', In 2015, Rwanda was awarded with funding support by the United Nations Trust Fund for Human Security (UNTFHS) for this project that is jointly implemented by six (6) UN Agencies namely: UNDP, UNFPA, UNICEF, WHO, UNHABITAT and IOM',
