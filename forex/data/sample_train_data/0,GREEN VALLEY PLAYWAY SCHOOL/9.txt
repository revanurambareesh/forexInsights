', We begin as the Montessori Learning Center', 
', 
  ', 
    ', Green Valley School first opened in the winter of 1976 as a single preschool
        classroom called The Montessori Leaning Center. This classroom came about
        as the result of more than a year of organizational effort by interested
        parents. ', 
  In 1977, Bruce Dow reorganized the school as a not-for-profit corporation and
  it took up residence in the Concordia Lutheran Church. ', 
    ', Enrollment grew and by 1979 a second classroom was added in space created 
        through remodeling an historic barn adjacent to the church. ', 
In the fall of 1982 we started our first elementary class with a group 
        of fifteen 6 to 9 year old children. Demand for the elementary class forced 
        the move in the fall of 1983 to the present location, a three acre farm 
    in Pembroke. ', 
    ', In 1985, a new addition provided two more classrooms. We moved out of the facilities
  at the Lutheran Church and housed a preschool, a lower elementary and the newly
  started upper elementary all on the same Pembroke site.', 
From 1986 to 1992 enrollment grew in the three classrooms, we added an elaborate
  play structure, and we constantly grew and expanded the library. At the end
  of 1994, Bruce Dow left the school as its director and Myrta Gage took on the
  position.', 
    ', From 1994 until 1998, under the direction of Myrta Gage, the school
        gradually grew to include two preschool classes, a toddler program, a
        lower elementary
  class and an upper elementary class. There were also a number of changes to
        the facility including expanded library space, larger coatrooms and expanded
        outside
  play space.', 
    ', 1998 was a transition year for Green Valley School. With a large projected
        shortfall, parents and the Board of Directors came together in a massive
        effort to rescue the school from its financial troubles. A new administration
        with Wanda Nichols as the administrator came on board in February. That
        fall we reopened the school, refurbished and renewed in spirit. ', 
In 2000 we changed our name to Green Valley School to reflect the addition of
  older students with a middle school. We continue to offer the best Montessori
  education in the area.',
