    www.simpletaxindia.netSection 194ADiscounting chargesIssue\u2022 Whether discounting charges are in the nature of \u2018interest\u2019 on which tax is  deductible?Held\u2022 Interest is the sum payable in respect of money borrowed or debt incurred\u2022 Bill discounting is a process in which sale consideration receivable on sale of  goods is discounted, which is not debt incurred or money borrowed\u2022 The Interest Tax Act, 1974 specifically includes discounting charges in the  definition of interest. However interest defined under the Income-tax Act, 1961  (Act) does not include discounting charges\u2022 Wherever the legislature intended the discount of bills of exchange to be included  within the definition of interest, the same was specifically provided for. Hence  omission of these words in the definition under the Act indicates the intention of  the legislator to keep the same out of the ambit of \u2018interest\u2019 under the Act\u2022 The same rationale is also laid down in Circular no. 65 issued by the Central  Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) in relation to section 194A of the Act\u2022 Circular no. 647 dated 22 March 1993 also referred to    Cargill Global Trading (I) (P) Limited (ITA Nos. 331 & 204 of 2011) (SC)5

The nexus of interest was only with the period from  which the purchase price became due\u2022 Thus, the outstanding price was a \u2018debt incurred\u2019 within the meaning of  interest under the Act                  Uniflex Cables Ltd. (150 TTJ 290) (Mumbai ITAT)        Circular no. 65 of 1971 \u2013 TDS is applicable where there is no immediate    discounting and the bank (as an agent) receives interest at the end of the period6

However, any work is wide enough to cover any kind of work which  one can get carried out through another\u2022 It is most inappropriate to equate rendering of a service to carrying out a work                  S.R.F.

    www.simpletaxindia.netSection 194ADiscounting chargesIssue\u2022 Whether discounting charges are in the nature of \u2018interest\u2019 on which tax is  deductible?Held\u2022 Interest is the sum payable in respect of money borrowed or debt incurred\u2022 Bill discounting is a process in which sale consideration receivable on sale of  goods is discounted, which is not debt incurred or money borrowed\u2022 The Interest Tax Act, 1974 specifically includes discounting charges in the  definition of interest. However interest defined under the Income-tax Act, 1961  (Act) does not include discounting charges\u2022 Wherever the legislature intended the discount of bills of exchange to be included  within the definition of interest, the same was specifically provided for. Hence  omission of these words in the definition under the Act indicates the intention of  the legislator to keep the same out of the ambit of \u2018interest\u2019 under the Act\u2022 The same rationale is also laid down in Circular no. 65 issued by the Central  Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) in relation to section 194A of the Act\u2022 Circular no. 647 dated 22 March 1993 also referred to    Cargill Global Trading (I) (P) Limited (ITA Nos. 331 & 204 of 2011) (SC)5

The nexus of interest was only with the period from  which the purchase price became due\u2022 Thus, the outstanding price was a \u2018debt incurred\u2019 within the meaning of  interest under the Act                  Uniflex Cables Ltd.

However, any work is wide enough to cover any kind of work which  one can get carried out through another\u2022 It is most inappropriate to equate rendering of a service to carrying out a work                  S.R.F.
