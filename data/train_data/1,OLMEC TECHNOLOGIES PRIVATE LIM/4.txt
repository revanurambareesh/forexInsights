        We were working with several global executive search firms, but the service and success rate was not what I thought acceptable. After engaging Olmec, we were most impressed. They were personal, upfront and direct to the extent that far more information about Bata\u2019s needs, culture, personalities etc was requested by them than any other firm. Olmec were successful keeping our best interest in mind and was successful in delivery, in our measure, money well spent. It was a pleasure doing business with Olmec, to the ultimate benefit of our business in several countries, and I would be happy to recommend them to anyone.
