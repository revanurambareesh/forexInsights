    DETAILS OF EACH STATION
VASANTVIHAR
Bottom to up method
265m length
1546m tunnel
VASANT VIHAR is the only metro station of the project CC-27 which is constructed using
Bottom-Up construction methodology. The ground profile of this station is medium hard
rocks. As a result of this, bottom-up method is preferred for this particular station. The TBM
used for tunnelling is also Rock TBM (HERRENKNECHT). There are total 26 grids on this
station. There are 2 back off houses from grid 1 to 7 and grid 20 to 26.
HAUZ KHAS
Top to down method
265m length
36m height
806m tunnel
HAUZ KHAS is an already existing station on yellow line. The second part of HAUZ KHAS
metro station is under construction joining IIT, MUNIRKA, R.K.PURAM and VASANT VIHAR.
The placement of these stations below the ground was to avoid the interruptions in the
traffic caused by the metro rail and the problems caused during the construction of the
station at that location. The road adjoining the station site carries a great amount of load
every day round the clock. The entrance to the station is located on OUTER RING ROAD.

    The station at the IIT is an underground station. The length of the IIT station is 265 m. The
width of the station is 21.57 m. All the stations are built with a basic bench mark. Every part
of the station is made with reference to this bench mark. The station at IIT is predicted to be
used by a huge crowd. As this metro station connects one of the prestigious institute of
India, IIT Delhi and also SDA market is behind IIT Station.
R.K PURAM
Top to bottom method
265m length
1067m tunnel
The approximate length and depth of this station is 265 m and 22m respectively. This station
connects Central Government Employees residential colony in South West DELHI. R.K
PURAM is roughly rectangular, enclosed by RING ROAD to the north, OUTER RING ROAD to
the south facing VASANT VIHAR, RAO TULA RAM MARG to the west and AFRICA AVENUE to
the east. The north-eastern corner of this area is a separate commercial centre called
MADAM BHIKAJI KAMA.
MUNIRKA
Top to bottom method
265m length
1241m tunnelMUNIRKA station is another underground station.. MUNIRKA
station connects JNU campus on south, VASANT VIHAR on North-West, RK PURAM on
northern side and IIT campus and BER SERAI on south-eastern front.

    CONSTRUCTIONMETHODOLOGY
TOP TO BOTTOM
It is a construction method in which the permanent slabs, in the form of perimeter ring, act
to resist the lateral forces by soil pressure to retaining wall (diaphragm wall) during
excavation of station box. The sequence of slab construction is from the roof slab to the
base slab.
It allows early restoration of the ground surface above the tunnel. Some of the temporary
supports of excavation walls are used as the permanent structural walls. The structural
slabs will act as internal bracing for the support of excavation. It requires less width of
construction area. Construction of roof slab is easy.
Not able to install external waterproofing outside the station box. More complicated
connections for the roof, concourse and base slab. Potential water leakage at the joints
between the slabs and the walls since water bar installation is not possible. Maintaining
quality of construction is difficult.

    BOTTOM TO UP
Quality can be maintained. Waterproofing can be applied to the station box.Drainage
systems can be installed outside the structure to channel water or divert it away from the
structure. No water leakage at the joints between the slabs and the walls since water bars
can be easily installed.
More machinery required for construction than Top-Down construction. The ground
surface can\u2019t be restored to its final condition until the construction is complete. May
require de-watering that could have adverse effects on surrounding infrastructure.
Component of Works for Bottom-Up Construction:
1. Earthworks (Same as in Top-Down method)
2. Excavation and Temporary Retaining structures- Rock anchoring/ Strut waler
arrangement
3. RCC Works- Columns, Beams, Slabs, External Wall.
4. Finishing
EARTHWORKS
Fill material, other than for road works, should be evenly graded granular material. Material
with more than 20% passing a 75 micron sieve or more than 10 % in excess of 75 mm size is
unlikely to be suitable for use. Clods or hard lumps of earth over 75 mm in greatest
dimension shall be broken up before compacting of the material in embankment.
Following types of material are considered unsuitable and shall not be used for fill for
embankment:
Materials brought from swamps, marshes or blogs
Peat, loam, fine silt, log, stump or organic or perishable materials
Material susceptible to spontaneous combustion
Clay of liquid limit exceeding 80 and plasticity index exceeding 55

    EXCAVATION
Excavation should be carried out by mechanized method up to the formation level at
stages. The activities for carrying out excavation are mainly rock excavation, SHOTCRETE,
ROCK BOLTING, disposal of excavated materials and grout monitoring. Excavation should
be carried out in proper sequence. Before excavating, a trial trench is dug for a depth of
1.5m.
Also, the site should be checked for utility lines and proper diversions should be done
beforehand. Traffic diversion plans should be made and it should be diverted before
starting the excavation. After all these things have been done, excavation is started.
Excavation of the soil can be done in two ways depending on the soil profile.
Soldier Pile
The soldier piles are I-beams that are running through-out the depth of the station and
provide a support to the roof slab and the concourse slab until the base slab is in place to
stabilize the structure. These piles are placed close to the diaphragm walls provideadditional
support to the excavated side in order to avoid the collapse of the soil during the piling
work.
This completes the construction of the supports structure to the main station structure. The
construction of the main station box is then initiated.
METHODOLOGY
1) Boring in soil with casing pipe if required and stabilizing liquid to rock head level
followed by drilling into rock to designed socket depth.
2) Installation of H-beam.
3) Backfilling of the borehole.
4) Extraction of the casing.

    PLACING OF DIAGONAL STRUT AND SOLDIER PILES
Soldier piles are used where load on the side is greater
ROCK BOLTING
When rock surface is exposed, Geologist shall be contracted to do the mapping of the
rock surface.
METHODOLOGY
1) Drilling
2) Grouting & Installation
3) Testing of Rock Bolts
RETAINING WALL
Retaining walls are structures designed to restrain soil to unnatural slopes. They are used to
bound soils between two different elevations often in areas of terrain possessing
undesirable slopes or in areas where the landscape needs to be shaped severely and
engineered for more specific purposes like hillside farming or roadway overpasses.

    BASE SLAB
The base slab supports the whole weight of the station. The diaphragm walls of the
station sustain huge amounts of lateral pressure from the backfill. This makes the
diaphragm wall act as a cantilever and it tends to lean inwards, but to sustain the
pressure the roof slab is constructed. The roof slab provides the support at one point.
The concourse slab built after the roof slab provides extra support to the D-wall. When
the base slab is constructed, it completes the box structure and provides additional
support and gives stability to the structure. The major work of the base slab is to support
the tracks and resist the vertical pressure from the ground. The construction process to
construct this slab is also the same as the roof slab and the concourse slab. The base slab
is placed 6.86 meters below the base of concourse slab and it is 900mm thick.
REINFORCEMENT STEEL IN BASE SLAB OF FINISHED BASE SLAB OF ES02
ES02
Steel of the base slab is not placed directly on soil because steel bars corrode in presence of
moisture, it weakens our structure. So first we do PCC on ground
PCC is plain cement concrete. PCC is a construction material generally used in binding
purposes and is composed of Portland cement, fly ash slag cement, aggregate, water and
chemical admixtures.

    COLOUMS
Columns or pillar in architecture and structural engineering is a structural element that
transmits, through compression, the weight of the structure above to other structural
elements below. It is a compression bar. Below every column there is FOOTING.
FOOTING
Footing is an element of an architectural structure which connects is to the ground, and
transfers loads from the structure to the ground.

At our station every column represents a grid. There are 26 grids on our station and 2 extra
grids also.
Roof slab
It is top most slab of the station box which is constructed the first in Top-Down method. For
the construction of the same, excavation is required at first. The excavation may cause a
major problem to the traffic flowing through the area. In that case, proper planning has to
be done beforehand for the diversion of traffic. Excavation should be started only after the
diversion has been done. This soil is then lined with 50mm thick PCC layer and 3mm thick
ply. These ply act as a base support for the concrete layer; it also gives a fine finishand a
uniform surface to the concrete layer. At the time of making of roof slab, several cut-outs
are left for further excavation required for construction of concourse and base slab and for
lowering of TBM for tunnelling.

CONCOURSE SLAB
Outlook of the station is said to be concourse slab. The activities at the station other than
the train tracks are all available on this slab. The slab serves as the gallery of the metro
station. It contains the entry and exit gates to the station, the ticket counters, and security
and fire escape provisions. The construction of the concourse slab is carried out in the

    same manner as the roof slab. This slab contains larger temporary cut- outs than the roof
slab. Thesecut-out spaces help in the laying and development of the base slab and lowering
of TBM for tunnelling. These cut-outs are closed during the final phase of the construction.
These cut- outs are initially supported by beams to provide stability to the D-walls. These
beams are removed after the structure is stabilized by the construction of the base slab. The
concourse slab is placed 5.25m below the base of the roof slab. Its thickness is 550mm. The
concourse slab contains exhaust vents (Over Track Exhaust ducts) at the sides of the slab.
The concourse slab contains the cavity provided to place the service lines inside the station.
The concourse slab is connected to the base slab with the help of stair case, escalator and
lift.
BLOCK WORK
Block work is required on many places at the site. Block work is expensive than brick work
also more time consuming, but it lasts long. At VASANT VIHAR site after placing of 3 layers
of block 2 steel bars are placed. During block work a LINTEL is provided after 2.35m height
and a column (MULLION) is provided after every 4.2m length and after every 45m length at
station a DOUBLE COLUMN is provided. THERMOCOL is used between double-column to fill
space. Cut-outs are also provided in block work. 10mm thick mortar layer is done between 2
blocks.Block\u2019s size is 400mm*200mm*200mm. Block contain M7.5 grade concrete.
BLOCK WORK AT STATION
Retaining wall is in direct contact with soil, therefore seepage is common problem. So we do
block work in front of the wall. We make SCUPPER DRAIN in between the gap of retaining
wall and block work

GROUTING
Grout is generally a mixture of water, cement, sand and sometimes fine gravel (if it is being
used to fill the cores of concrete blocks). It is applied as a thick emulsion and hardens over
time, much like its close relative mortar.

    FINISHING WORKS
Finishing works is a final stage of each construction which is a fine job to bring the beauty of
the construction. It also hides the services like conduits, ducting, piping etc. Several types of
finishes can be used based on the material used, environmental conditions and costs.
Finishing can be divided into several sections:
Floor
Wall
Ceiling
FLOORING
Flooring is a general term for a permanent covering of a floor or for the work of
installing such a floor covering.
Floor covering is a term to describe any finish material applied over a floor structure
to provide a walking space.
TYPES OF FLOORING AT VASANT VIHAR
1) Honed/ Polished Granite with Tactile Floor Strip
2) False Floor (600x600mm Floor Tile) 450mm high with Anti Dust sealer coat on
concrete floor below false floor
3) Polished vitrified tiles (600x600mm)
4) 450mm High filled floor with 600x600mm polished vitrified tile flooring
5) Polished KOTA stone (550x550mm)
6) HARDONITE flooring
7) Matt Vitrified tiles 600x600mm
HARDONITE FLOORING
This flooring is done where heavy machineries are there because they create
vibrations, so some hard flooring is required to overcome this.

WALL FINISHING
As the name \u2018Wall Finishes\u2019 itself suggests that it is finish given to the wall to enhance the
interior or exterior look of the structure. Wall finishes used for the interiors are quite
delicate and need maintenance.
Wall Finishes provide a decorative skin to conceal building components incl. structural
members, insulation, duct work, pipes and wires etc.

    TUNNELING
A tunnel is an underground or underwater passageway, enclosed except for entrance
and exit, commonly at each end.
The tunnelling in CC-27 project is taken care by SUCG Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. There are
different techniques of tunnelling viz. drilling and blasting, NATM, hydraulic splitter,
slurry shield machine, etc. All the tunnels in project CC-27 are to be made using TBM. A
Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM), also known as a "mole", is a machine used to excavate
tunnels with a circular cross section through a variety of soil and rock strata. TBMs and
associated back-up systems are used to highly automate the entire tunnelling process,
reducing tunnelling costs. In certain predominantly urban applications, tunnel boring is
viewed as quick and cost effective alternative to laying surface rails and roads. Expensive
compulsory purchase of buildings and land, with potentially lengthy planning inquiries, is
eliminated.
There are a variety of TBM designs that can operate in a variety of conditions, from hard
rock to soft water-bearing ground. Some types of TBMs, the slurry and earth-pressure
balance machines, have pressurized compartments at the front end, allowing them to be
used in difficult conditions below the water table. This pressurizes the ground ahead of
the TBM cutter head to balance the water pressure. The operators work in normal air
pressure behind the pressurized compartment, but may occasionally have toenter that
compartment to renew or repair the cutters. This requires special precautions, such as
local ground treatment or halting the TBMat a position free from water. Despite these
difficulties, TBMs are now preferred over the older method of tunnelling in compressed
air, with an air lock/decompression chamber some way back from the TBM, which
required operators to work in high pressure and go through decompression procedures
at the end of their shifts, much like deep-sea divers.
The TBMs operating in Project CC-27 are:
1. THI 1 TBM
2. THI 2 TBM
3. OKUMURA TBM
4. HERRENKNECHT TBM

2. Installation of Cradle
3. TBM lifting & assembly

6. Tunnel Eye breaking
Before starting the tunnelling activities, it is necessary to improve the soil characteristics
at the head of the launching shaft /retrieval shaft and along the cross passage. High
Pressure Jet grouting method to improve the soil stabilization (350 to 400 bar pressure).
Cradle is fixed according to the tunnel centre line before TBM unloading.

BATCHING PLANT AND CASTING YARD
BATCHING PLANT
Concrete is the basic engineering material used in most of the civil engineering
structures. Its popularity as basic building material in construction is because of, its
economy of use, good durability and ease with which it can be manufactured at site. The
ability to mould it into any shape and size, because of its plasticity in green state and its
subsequent hardening to achieve strength, is particularly useful. Concrete like other
engineering materials needs to be designed for properties like strength, durability,
workability and cohesion. Concrete mix design is the science of deciding relative
proportions of ingredients of concrete, to achieve the desired properties in the most
economical way. With advent of high-rise buildings and pre-stressed concrete, use of
higher grades of concrete is becoming more common. Even the revised IS 456-2000
advocates use of higher grade of concrete for more severe conditions of exposure, for
durability considerations. With advent of new generation admixtures, it is possible to
achieve higher grades of concrete with high workability levels economically. Use of
mineral admixtures like fly ash, slag and silica fume have revolutionised the concrete
technology by increasing strength and durability of concrete by many folds. Mix design
of concrete is becoming more relevant in the above mentioned scenario. However, it
should be borne in mind that mix design when adoptedat site should be implemented
with proper understanding and with necessary precautions.
MIX DESIGN
Concrete is an extremely versatile building material because, it can be designed for
strength ranging from M10 (10MPA) to M100 (100 MPA) and workability ranging from 0
mm slump to 150 mm slump. In all these cases the basic ingredients of concrete are the
same, but it is their relative proportioning that makes the difference.
Batching plant of CC27 L&T-SUCG JV is situated in PUSHP VIHAR. Since it is batching
plant where concrete batch production takes place therefore there is a need of QUALITY
ASSURANCE/ QUALITY CONTROL lab at batching plant. There are two batching systems
at PUSHP VIHAR, CP60 and CP30.

    CONSTRUCTIONMETHODOLOGY
TOP TO BOTTOM
It is a construction method in which the permanent slabs, in the form of perimeter ring, act
to resist the lateral forces by soil pressure to retaining wall (diaphragm wall) during
excavation of station box. The sequence of slab construction is from the roof slab to the
base slab.
It allows early restoration of the ground surface above the tunnel. Some of the temporary
supports of excavation walls are used as the permanent structural walls. The structural
slabs will act as internal bracing for the support of excavation. It requires less width of
construction area. Construction of roof slab is easy.
Not able to install external waterproofing outside the station box. More complicated
connections for the roof, concourse and base slab. Potential water leakage at the joints
between the slabs and the walls since water bar installation is not possible. Maintaining
quality of construction is difficult.

Quality can be maintained. Waterproofing can be applied to the station box.Drainage
systems can be installed outside the structure to channel water or divert it away from the
structure. No water leakage at the joints between the slabs and the walls since water bars
can be easily installed.
More machinery required for construction than Top-Down construction. The ground
surface can\u2019t be restored to its final condition until the construction is complete. May
require de-watering that could have adverse effects on surrounding infrastructure.
Component of Works for Bottom-Up Construction:
1. Earthworks (Same as in Top-Down method)
2. Excavation and Temporary Retaining structures- Rock anchoring/ Strut waler
arrangement
3. RCC Works- Columns, Beams, Slabs, External Wall.

EARTHWORKS
Fill material, other than for road works, should be evenly graded granular material. Material
with more than 20% passing a 75 micron sieve or more than 10 % in excess of 75 mm size is
unlikely to be suitable for use. Clods or hard lumps of earth over 75 mm in greatest
dimension shall be broken up before compacting of the material in embankment.
Following types of material are considered unsuitable and shall not be used for fill for
embankment:
Materials brought from swamps, marshes or blogs
Peat, loam, fine silt, log, stump or organic or perishable materials
Material susceptible to spontaneous combustion

    EXCAVATION
Excavation should be carried out by mechanized method up to the formation level at
stages. The activities for carrying out excavation are mainly rock excavation, SHOTCRETE,
ROCK BOLTING, disposal of excavated materials and grout monitoring. Excavation should
be carried out in proper sequence. Before excavating, a trial trench is dug for a depth of
1.5m.
Also, the site should be checked for utility lines and proper diversions should be done
beforehand. Traffic diversion plans should be made and it should be diverted before
starting the excavation. After all these things have been done, excavation is started.
Excavation of the soil can be done in two ways depending on the soil profile.
Soldier Pile
The soldier piles are I-beams that are running through-out the depth of the station and
provide a support to the roof slab and the concourse slab until the base slab is in place to
stabilize the structure. These piles are placed close to the diaphragm walls provideadditional
support to the excavated side in order to avoid the collapse of the soil during the piling
work.
This completes the construction of the supports structure to the main station structure. The
construction of the main station box is then initiated.
METHODOLOGY
1) Boring in soil with casing pipe if required and stabilizing liquid to rock head level
followed by drilling into rock to designed socket depth.
2) Installation of H-beam.
3) Backfilling of the borehole.
4) Extraction of the casing.

RETAINING WALL
Retaining walls are structures designed to restrain soil to unnatural slopes. They are used to
bound soils between two different elevations often in areas of terrain possessing
undesirable slopes or in areas where the landscape needs to be shaped severely and
engineered for more specific purposes like hillside farming or roadway overpasses.

    BASE SLAB
The base slab supports the whole weight of the station. The diaphragm walls of the
station sustain huge amounts of lateral pressure from the backfill. This makes the
diaphragm wall act as a cantilever and it tends to lean inwards, but to sustain the
pressure the roof slab is constructed. The roof slab provides the support at one point.
The concourse slab built after the roof slab provides extra support to the D-wall. When
the base slab is constructed, it completes the box structure and provides additional
support and gives stability to the structure. The major work of the base slab is to support
the tracks and resist the vertical pressure from the ground. The construction process to
construct this slab is also the same as the roof slab and the concourse slab. The base slab
is placed 6.86 meters below the base of concourse slab and it is 900mm thick.
REINFORCEMENT STEEL IN BASE SLAB OF FINISHED BASE SLAB OF ES02
ES02
Steel of the base slab is not placed directly on soil because steel bars corrode in presence of
moisture, it weakens our structure. So first we do PCC on ground
PCC is plain cement concrete. PCC is a construction material generally used in binding
purposes and is composed of Portland cement, fly ash slag cement, aggregate, water and
chemical admixtures.

    COLOUMS
Columns or pillar in architecture and structural engineering is a structural element that
transmits, through compression, the weight of the structure above to other structural
elements below. It is a compression bar. Below every column there is FOOTING.
FOOTING
Footing is an element of an architectural structure which connects is to the ground, and
transfers loads from the structure to the ground.

At our station every column represents a grid. There are 26 grids on our station and 2 extra
grids also.
Roof slab
It is top most slab of the station box which is constructed the first in Top-Down method. For
the construction of the same, excavation is required at first. The excavation may cause a
major problem to the traffic flowing through the area. In that case, proper planning has to
be done beforehand for the diversion of traffic. Excavation should be started only after the
diversion has been done. This soil is then lined with 50mm thick PCC layer and 3mm thick
ply. These ply act as a base support for the concrete layer; it also gives a fine finishand a
uniform surface to the concrete layer. At the time of making of roof slab, several cut-outs
are left for further excavation required for construction of concourse and base slab and for
lowering of TBM for tunnelling.

CONCOURSE SLAB
Outlook of the station is said to be concourse slab. The activities at the station other than
the train tracks are all available on this slab. The slab serves as the gallery of the metro
station. It contains the entry and exit gates to the station, the ticket counters, and security
and fire escape provisions. The construction of the concourse slab is carried out in the

    same manner as the roof slab. This slab contains larger temporary cut- outs than the roof
slab. Thesecut-out spaces help in the laying and development of the base slab and lowering
of TBM for tunnelling. These cut-outs are closed during the final phase of the construction.
These cut- outs are initially supported by beams to provide stability to the D-walls. These
beams are removed after the structure is stabilized by the construction of the base slab. The
concourse slab is placed 5.25m below the base of the roof slab. Its thickness is 550mm. The
concourse slab contains exhaust vents (Over Track Exhaust ducts) at the sides of the slab.
The concourse slab contains the cavity provided to place the service lines inside the station.
The concourse slab is connected to the base slab with the help of stair case, escalator and
lift.
BLOCK WORK
Block work is required on many places at the site. Block work is expensive than brick work
also more time consuming, but it lasts long. At VASANT VIHAR site after placing of 3 layers
of block 2 steel bars are placed. During block work a LINTEL is provided after 2.35m height
and a column (MULLION) is provided after every 4.2m length and after every 45m length at
station a DOUBLE COLUMN is provided. THERMOCOL is used between double-column to fill
space. Cut-outs are also provided in block work. 10mm thick mortar layer is done between 2
blocks.Block\u2019s size is 400mm*200mm*200mm. Block contain M7.5 grade concrete.
BLOCK WORK AT STATION
Retaining wall is in direct contact with soil, therefore seepage is common problem. So we do
block work in front of the wall. We make SCUPPER DRAIN in between the gap of retaining
wall and block work

the construction. It also hides the services like conduits, ducting, piping etc. Several types of
finishes can be used based on the material used, environmental conditions and costs.
Finishing can be divided into several sections:
Floor
Wall

FLOORING
Flooring is a general term for a permanent covering of a floor or for the work of
installing such a floor covering.
Floor covering is a term to describe any finish material applied over a floor structure
to provide a walking space.

    TUNNELING
A tunnel is an underground or underwater passageway, enclosed except for entrance
and exit, commonly at each end.
The tunnelling in CC-27 project is taken care by SUCG Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. There are
different techniques of tunnelling viz. drilling and blasting, NATM, hydraulic splitter,
slurry shield machine, etc. All the tunnels in project CC-27 are to be made using TBM. A
Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM), also known as a "mole", is a machine used to excavate
tunnels with a circular cross section through a variety of soil and rock strata. TBMs and
associated back-up systems are used to highly automate the entire tunnelling process,
reducing tunnelling costs. In certain predominantly urban applications, tunnel boring is
viewed as quick and cost effective alternative to laying surface rails and roads. Expensive
compulsory purchase of buildings and land, with potentially lengthy planning inquiries, is
eliminated.
There are a variety of TBM designs that can operate in a variety of conditions, from hard
rock to soft water-bearing ground. Some types of TBMs, the slurry and earth-pressure
balance machines, have pressurized compartments at the front end, allowing them to be
used in difficult conditions below the water table. This pressurizes the ground ahead of
the TBM cutter head to balance the water pressure. The operators work in normal air
pressure behind the pressurized compartment, but may occasionally have toenter that
compartment to renew or repair the cutters. This requires special precautions, such as
local ground treatment or halting the TBMat a position free from water. Despite these
difficulties, TBMs are now preferred over the older method of tunnelling in compressed
air, with an air lock/decompression chamber some way back from the TBM, which
required operators to work in high pressure and go through decompression procedures
at the end of their shifts, much like deep-sea divers.
The TBMs operating in Project CC-27 are:
1. THI 1 TBM
2. THI 2 TBM
3. OKUMURA TBM

BATCHING PLANT AND CASTING YARD
BATCHING PLANT
Concrete is the basic engineering material used in most of the civil engineering
structures. Its popularity as basic building material in construction is because of, its
economy of use, good durability and ease with which it can be manufactured at site. The
ability to mould it into any shape and size, because of its plasticity in green state and its
subsequent hardening to achieve strength, is particularly useful. Concrete like other
engineering materials needs to be designed for properties like strength, durability,
workability and cohesion. Concrete mix design is the science of deciding relative
proportions of ingredients of concrete, to achieve the desired properties in the most
economical way. With advent of high-rise buildings and pre-stressed concrete, use of
higher grades of concrete is becoming more common. Even the revised IS 456-2000
advocates use of higher grade of concrete for more severe conditions of exposure, for
durability considerations. With advent of new generation admixtures, it is possible to
achieve higher grades of concrete with high workability levels economically. Use of
mineral admixtures like fly ash, slag and silica fume have revolutionised the concrete
technology by increasing strength and durability of concrete by many folds. Mix design
of concrete is becoming more relevant in the above mentioned scenario. However, it
should be borne in mind that mix design when adoptedat site should be implemented
with proper understanding and with necessary precautions.
MIX DESIGN
Concrete is an extremely versatile building material because, it can be designed for
strength ranging from M10 (10MPA) to M100 (100 MPA) and workability ranging from 0
mm slump to 150 mm slump. In all these cases the basic ingredients of concrete are the
same, but it is their relative proportioning that makes the difference.
Batching plant of CC27 L&T-SUCG JV is situated in PUSHP VIHAR. Since it is batching
plant where concrete batch production takes place therefore there is a need of QUALITY
ASSURANCE/ QUALITY CONTROL lab at batching plant. There are two batching systems
at PUSHP VIHAR, CP60 and CP30.
