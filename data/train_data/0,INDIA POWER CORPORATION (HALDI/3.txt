', Sangli city- the district place - is situated on the bank of Krishna river. The valley of the River Krishna and its tributaries offer many irrigation and agricultural advantages which drives the economy of the district and the city. Other small rivers, such as the Warana and the Panchganga, flow into the River Krishna.', 
', History', [', edit', ]', 
', See also: ', Sangli State', 
', The region, known as Kundal (now a small village 40 km away from Sangli city) in medieval India, was the capital of the ', Chalukya Empire',  in 12th century AD.', [4]',  During the time of Shivaji, Sangli, Miraj and surrounding areas were captured from the Mughal Empire. Until 1801, Sangli was included in Miraj Jahagir. Sangli separated from Miraj in 1801, following a family quarrel between Chintamanrao Patwardhan, and his paternal uncle, Gangadharrao Patwardhan, who had succeeded his childless elder brother as the sixth chief of Miraj in 1782. Chintamanrao, a born soldier, commanded the Miraj cavalry in the Maratha armies that served with the British against the Nizam, Tipu Sultan and ', Dhondia Waugh', u". When he returned to Miraj in 1800, after his many campaigns, and having reached his majority, he found his uncle unwilling to yield control to him. Disgusted with this state of affairs, the young nephew seized the family idol and left the palace in a huff. In 1801 he established himself at a new capital at Sangli and set about taking control over as much of his patrimony as he was able. Continuing quarrels and disagreements threatened to cause fighting until the British Resident at the Peshwa's court decided to settle the matter by effecting an agreement in 1812. This Treaty of Pandharpur was formally recognised by the British authorities in 1817 and further augmented by separate treaties with the HEIC in 1819.", 
', u"Chintamanrao reigned for fifty years, during which he maintained very close relations with the British. His participation in the southern campaigns included a close association with the Duke of Wellington, with whom he maintained a lifelong friendship. He served in several other campaigns, even offering to lead contingents to Persia and Afghanistan to fight the company's enemies. However, his interests ranged more widely than mere soldering. He encouraged industry and agriculture, took an interest in religious affairs, and promoted inter-communal and inter-faith understanding, more than a century before it became the norm. He died in 1851, aged seventy-five, full of honours and respect.", 
', Dhundirajrao succeeded his father not merely as ruler, but also in continuing the good work begun by his father. However, he took a keener interest in education, building schools, colleges and vocational institutions. This interest extended to the fields of female education and the so-called backwards classes, for whom he built special schools. He even promoted education amongst his Muslim subjects, a community who until then were suspicious of modern innovations. Thanks to his efforts in promoting various agricultural enterprises, Sangli is today the centre of the world ', turmeric',  trade, has the largest sugar refinery in Asia and is the most important centre for grape production in India. Despite seven marriages, he only sired two daughters. The succession was left to a distant relative, chosen by the British authorities and adopted by his senior widow.', 
', Vinayakrao Chintamanrao, who succeeded as Chintamanrao Dhundirajrao on adoption, was no less distinguished than his two predecessors. He also reigned for a long period of sixty-four years. During this time he vastly improved the material, educational, spiritual and political development of his people. He promoted industrial and agricultural development on an unprecedented scale, making his little state something of a powerhouse in the area. Educational facilities were expanded in many areas with the establishment of arts, science, engineering and medical colleges. Access to capital improved with the foundation of a state bank, which helped poor farmers and fledgeling industrialists to raise funds. Representative institutions at local and state level encouraged the growth of democracy. He took an active part in supporting the war effort, in the activities of the Chamber of Princes, the Indian Round Table Conferences in London, and on the committee established to create a federal structure for India. A friend of the British and Gandhi alike, he enthusiastically supported independence and acceded to the Dominion India in 1947, then merged his state with Bombay. Raja Vijaysinhrao Patwardhan succeeded his grandfather in 1965. In 1842 the first Marathi Drama named ', Sita Swayamvar',  had staged in the Patwardhan Wada ', Rajwada',  ', [5]',

', Princely State of Sangli', [', edit', ]', 
', Main article: ', Sangli State', 
', The Principality of Sangli covered an area of 1112 square miles (2942 square kilometers), and had a population of 226,128 in 1901, while the population of the town itself was 16,829 in that year. In 1911, the state had a revenue estimated at £10,000. Sangli joined the dominion of India on March 8, 1948 and is currently a part of the state of Maharashtra.',

', Turmeric Production and Trade', [', edit', ]', 
', Turmeric',  production and trade in nearby areas of Sangli city follows a centuries-old practice\u2014storing turmeric in pits. These pits stretch far out in the open fields of the villages of Haripur and Sangalwadi. It is possibly the most unusual agricultural commodity-storage system in the country.', 
', After clearing the loose soil covering the pit, it is left open for about two to three hours. One cannot enter the pit until one finds out if there is any oxygen within. To ascertain this, a lantern is lowered into the pit. If the lantern does not go out, it is safe to enter the pit.', 
', It was this ingenious storage system, devised over 200 years ago, that turned Sangli into a major trading centre for turmeric. Raw turmeric sold by farmers is stored in these pits, eighteen to twenty feet (five to six metres) deep, for three to four years. The pits provide the best storage facility for turmeric, as the quality of the commodity remains unchanged. The turmeric hardens and matures while in storage. Today, more than 80% of the turmeric trade in India takes place in Sangli.', [', citation needed', ]',

', Sagareshwar Wildlife Sanctuary', [', edit', ]', 
', The sanctuary is forested, but with grassy hill slopes. The forests are southern dry mixed deciduous and southern thorn forest. Protection from grazing and forest fire has resulted in good regeneration of dry deciduous species. The forest department introduced many plants in the area, including Tamarind, Neem, Nilgiri, Acacia, Agave, and Khair.', 
', Flora and fauna', : Large animals found in the sanctuary include several types of deer (Sambar Deer, Blackbucks, Muntjac, Chital) as well as wild boar and peacocks. Small carnivores like hyena, fox and porcupines are also found in the area. A large number of insects, birds and reptiles such as pythons and other snakes are also present.', 
', Tourism', : The sanctuary is a popular tourist destination, with the peak tourism season being from August to February. The most popular tourist activity is hiking to the top of a hill in the sanctuary, from which one can see the ', Krishna River',  flowing through fields of ', sugarcane',  and ', grapevines', . Also in the area are numerous shrines to Shiva which were built during the ', Chalukya dynasty', , and the ', Krishna Valley Wine Park',  in ', Palus', .', 
', About Sagareshwar', : The Sagareshwar sanctuary has much religious, cultural and archaeological significance. The sanctuary derives its name from an ancient famous Shiva temple that attracts a large number of devotees. It actually consists of one large temple and a complex of 51 small temples, all from the Satvahana period. You will find the Kamal Bhairao temple, partially hewn from hard Basalt rock perched on the edge of a steep cliff. The entrance to the temple is through a narrow tunnel.', 
', Ganapati Temple', [', edit', ]', 
', Ganesh temple is the greatest religious attraction in Sangli. It is the ', Kuldaivat',  of Patwardhans. Besides the main temple of Ganesh there are four more, but smaller ones, of Suryanarayan, Cintamanesvar, Laksmi-Narayan and Chinta\u2212manesvari, which together with the chief deity forms the ', Ganapati panchayatan', .', 
', The construction of the temple was started by the late Sri ', Appasaheb Patwardhan', . The basalt stone blocks used for the construction were brought from the Jyotiba hills near Kolhapur.', 
', The whole structure stands on a fairly large quadrangular court. The Princely residence is close by and facing the river, on which side there is a wall flanked by two bastions and loopholed for musketry. Sri ', Chintamanrav Appahaheb Patvardhan',  built the mandap at a later date. The stone used is of the same type as that employed for the construction of the original temple and the sculptural work and the designs are also befitting the original shrine. It was completed in 1952 and was inaugurated by ', Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan', .', 
', A huge and massive gate of red sand\u2212stone, recently constructed, leads into the spacious courtyard. The gate has grandeur of its own and is the work of skilled architects and artisans of great repute. It is composed of three arches for entry. The central arch is bigger than the side ones. In the courtyard two lotus shaped fountains can be seen.', 
', A mandap hall is supported on eight polished and ornamented pillars supporting galleries on both sides. The ceiling of the mandap bears beautiful designs, a huge chandelier hanging from the centre of the ceiling. In addition to the main entrance there are four more doors, two on either side. On the wall are reproduced sacred hymns from the ', Bhagavad Gita', . On the right side of the hall, the sandalwood-crafted chariot with the images of Arjuna and Krushna can be seen. It delineates Krishna preaching Bhagvadgita to Arjuna when he refused to right ihe Kauravas on the historic battle\u2212field of Kuruksetra.', 
', The 1.16 sq. m pedestal of black stone supports white marble idol of ', Ganesh', , with ', Riddhi',  and ', Siddhi',  idols. This part is approached by steps fixed at both the extreme ends. The ', Garbhagriha',  is crowned by a shikhar with a brass spire plated with gold. It bears various designs and carvings and figure\u2212filled niches, In the corners there are smaller replicas of the main ', Shikhara', .', 
', The shrine as a whole is one of the excellent specimen of stone carvings and polished stone\u2212work. Of the remaining four temples of the panchayatan, two, viz., Chintamanesvar and Suryanarayan are on the right side, arranged one behind the other, placing one of the fountains mentioned above in the middle. The other two, viz., Lakshmi\u2212Narayan and Chintamanesvari are on the left also arranged in the same manner. Behind the temple of Suryanarayan there is the stone sculpture of a baby elephant trampling a tiger.', 
', Ganapati Panchayatan Trust maintains the temple. The trust receives grants from Patvardhans,as a part of tradition which continues till the present day. In the backyard of the Ganesha temple court there is a small black stone idol of Kuranesvari housed in a small arch of stone.',

', Sangli city- the district place - is situated on the bank of Krishna river. The valley of the River Krishna and its tributaries offer many irrigation and agricultural advantages which drives the economy of the district and the city. Other small rivers, such as the Warana and the Panchganga, flow into the River Krishna.', 
', History', [', edit', ]', 
', See also: ', Sangli State', 
', The region, known as Kundal (now a small village 40 km away from Sangli city) in medieval India, was the capital of the ', Chalukya Empire',  in 12th century AD.', [4]',  During the time of Shivaji, Sangli, Miraj and surrounding areas were captured from the Mughal Empire. Until 1801, Sangli was included in Miraj Jahagir. Sangli separated from Miraj in 1801, following a family quarrel between Chintamanrao Patwardhan, and his paternal uncle, Gangadharrao Patwardhan, who had succeeded his childless elder brother as the sixth chief of Miraj in 1782. Chintamanrao, a born soldier, commanded the Miraj cavalry in the Maratha armies that served with the British against the Nizam, Tipu Sultan and ', Dhondia Waugh', u". When he returned to Miraj in 1800, after his many campaigns, and having reached his majority, he found his uncle unwilling to yield control to him. Disgusted with this state of affairs, the young nephew seized the family idol and left the palace in a huff. In 1801 he established himself at a new capital at Sangli and set about taking control over as much of his patrimony as he was able. Continuing quarrels and disagreements threatened to cause fighting until the British Resident at the Peshwa's court decided to settle the matter by effecting an agreement in 1812. This Treaty of Pandharpur was formally recognised by the British authorities in 1817 and further augmented by separate treaties with the HEIC in 1819.", 
', u"Chintamanrao reigned for fifty years, during which he maintained very close relations with the British. His participation in the southern campaigns included a close association with the Duke of Wellington, with whom he maintained a lifelong friendship. He served in several other campaigns, even offering to lead contingents to Persia and Afghanistan to fight the company's enemies. However, his interests ranged more widely than mere soldering. He encouraged industry and agriculture, took an interest in religious affairs, and promoted inter-communal and inter-faith understanding, more than a century before it became the norm. He died in 1851, aged seventy-five, full of honours and respect.", 
', Dhundirajrao succeeded his father not merely as ruler, but also in continuing the good work begun by his father. However, he took a keener interest in education, building schools, colleges and vocational institutions. This interest extended to the fields of female education and the so-called backwards classes, for whom he built special schools. He even promoted education amongst his Muslim subjects, a community who until then were suspicious of modern innovations. Thanks to his efforts in promoting various agricultural enterprises, Sangli is today the centre of the world ', turmeric',  trade, has the largest sugar refinery in Asia and is the most important centre for grape production in India. Despite seven marriages, he only sired two daughters. The succession was left to a distant relative, chosen by the British authorities and adopted by his senior widow.', 
', Vinayakrao Chintamanrao, who succeeded as Chintamanrao Dhundirajrao on adoption, was no less distinguished than his two predecessors. He also reigned for a long period of sixty-four years. During this time he vastly improved the material, educational, spiritual and political development of his people. He promoted industrial and agricultural development on an unprecedented scale, making his little state something of a powerhouse in the area. Educational facilities were expanded in many areas with the establishment of arts, science, engineering and medical colleges. Access to capital improved with the foundation of a state bank, which helped poor farmers and fledgeling industrialists to raise funds. Representative institutions at local and state level encouraged the growth of democracy. He took an active part in supporting the war effort, in the activities of the Chamber of Princes, the Indian Round Table Conferences in London, and on the committee established to create a federal structure for India. A friend of the British and Gandhi alike, he enthusiastically supported independence and acceded to the Dominion India in 1947, then merged his state with Bombay. Raja Vijaysinhrao Patwardhan succeeded his grandfather in 1965. In 1842 the first Marathi Drama named ', Sita Swayamvar',  had staged in the Patwardhan Wada ', Rajwada',  ', [5]',

', Sangli at present', [', edit', ]', 
', The twin cities of Sangli and Miraj have merged to form an urban agglomeration.

', Princely State of Sangli', [', edit', ]', 
', Main article: ', Sangli State', 
', The Principality of Sangli covered an area of 1112 square miles (2942 square kilometers), and had a population of 226,128 in 1901, while the population of the town itself was 16,829 in that year. In 1911, the state had a revenue estimated at £10,000. Sangli joined the dominion of India on March 8, 1948 and is currently a part of the state of Maharashtra.', 
', Sangli was one of the 11-gun salute ', princely states',  of ', British India', , under the Kolhapur-Deccan Residency in the ', Bombay Presidency', , and later the ', Deccan States Agency', .

', Turmeric Production and Trade', [', edit', ]', 
', Turmeric',  production and trade in nearby areas of Sangli city follows a centuries-old practice\u2014storing turmeric in pits. These pits stretch far out in the open fields of the villages of Haripur and Sangalwadi. It is possibly the most unusual agricultural commodity-storage system in the country.', 
', After clearing the loose soil covering the pit, it is left open for about two to three hours. One cannot enter the pit until one finds out if there is any oxygen within. To ascertain this, a lantern is lowered into the pit. If the lantern does not go out, it is safe to enter the pit.', 
', It was this ingenious storage system, devised over 200 years ago, that turned Sangli into a major trading centre for turmeric. Raw turmeric sold by farmers is stored in these pits, eighteen to twenty feet (five to six metres) deep, for three to four years. The pits provide the best storage facility for turmeric, as the quality of the commodity remains unchanged. The turmeric hardens and matures while in storage. Today, more than 80% of the turmeric trade in India takes place in Sangli.', [', citation needed', ]',

', Sagareshwar Wildlife Sanctuary', [', edit', ]', 
', The sanctuary is forested, but with grassy hill slopes. The forests are southern dry mixed deciduous and southern thorn forest. Protection from grazing and forest fire has resulted in good regeneration of dry deciduous species. The forest department introduced many plants in the area, including Tamarind, Neem, Nilgiri, Acacia, Agave, and Khair.', 
', Flora and fauna', : Large animals found in the sanctuary include several types of deer (Sambar Deer, Blackbucks, Muntjac, Chital) as well as wild boar and peacocks. Small carnivores like hyena, fox and porcupines are also found in the area. A large number of insects, birds and reptiles such as pythons and other snakes are also present.', 
', Tourism', : The sanctuary is a popular tourist destination, with the peak tourism season being from August to February. The most popular tourist activity is hiking to the top of a hill in the sanctuary, from which one can see the ', Krishna River',  flowing through fields of ', sugarcane',  and ', grapevines', . Also in the area are numerous shrines to Shiva which were built during the ', Chalukya dynasty', , and the ', Krishna Valley Wine Park',  in ', Palus', .', 
', About Sagareshwar', : The Sagareshwar sanctuary has much religious, cultural and archaeological significance. The sanctuary derives its name from an ancient famous Shiva temple that attracts a large number of devotees. It actually consists of one large temple and a complex of 51 small temples, all from the Satvahana period. You will find the Kamal Bhairao temple, partially hewn from hard Basalt rock perched on the edge of a steep cliff. The entrance to the temple is through a narrow tunnel.', 
', Ganapati Temple', [', edit', ]', 
', Ganesh temple is the greatest religious attraction in Sangli. It is the ', Kuldaivat',  of Patwardhans. Besides the main temple of Ganesh there are four more, but smaller ones, of Suryanarayan, Cintamanesvar, Laksmi-Narayan and Chinta\u2212manesvari, which together with the chief deity forms the ', Ganapati panchayatan', .', 
', The construction of the temple was started by the late Sri ', Appasaheb Patwardhan', . The basalt stone blocks used for the construction were brought from the Jyotiba hills near Kolhapur.', 
', The whole structure stands on a fairly large quadrangular court. The Princely residence is close by and facing the river, on which side there is a wall flanked by two bastions and loopholed for musketry. Sri ', Chintamanrav Appahaheb Patvardhan',  built the mandap at a later date. The stone used is of the same type as that employed for the construction of the original temple and the sculptural work and the designs are also befitting the original shrine. It was completed in 1952 and was inaugurated by ', Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan', .', 
', A huge and massive gate of red sand\u2212stone, recently constructed, leads into the spacious courtyard. The gate has grandeur of its own and is the work of skilled architects and artisans of great repute. It is composed of three arches for entry. The central arch is bigger than the side ones. In the courtyard two lotus shaped fountains can be seen.', 
', A mandap hall is supported on eight polished and ornamented pillars supporting galleries on both sides. The ceiling of the mandap bears beautiful designs, a huge chandelier hanging from the centre of the ceiling. In addition to the main entrance there are four more doors, two on either side. On the wall are reproduced sacred hymns from the ', Bhagavad Gita', . On the right side of the hall, the sandalwood-crafted chariot with the images of Arjuna and Krushna can be seen. It delineates Krishna preaching Bhagvadgita to Arjuna when he refused to right ihe Kauravas on the historic battle\u2212field of Kuruksetra.', 
', The 1.16 sq. m pedestal of black stone supports white marble idol of ', Ganesh', , with ', Riddhi',  and ', Siddhi',  idols. This part is approached by steps fixed at both the extreme ends. The ', Garbhagriha',  is crowned by a shikhar with a brass spire plated with gold. It bears various designs and carvings and figure\u2212filled niches, In the corners there are smaller replicas of the main ', Shikhara', .', 
', The shrine as a whole is one of the excellent specimen of stone carvings and polished stone\u2212work. Of the remaining four temples of the panchayatan, two, viz., Chintamanesvar and Suryanarayan are on the right side, arranged one behind the other, placing one of the fountains mentioned above in the middle. The other two, viz., Lakshmi\u2212Narayan and Chintamanesvari are on the left also arranged in the same manner. Behind the temple of Suryanarayan there is the stone sculpture of a baby elephant trampling a tiger.', 
', Ganapati Panchayatan Trust maintains the temple. The trust receives grants from Patvardhans,as a part of tradition which continues till the present day. In the backyard of the Ganesha temple court there is a small black stone idol of Kuranesvari housed in a small arch of stone.',
