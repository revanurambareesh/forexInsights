        ', About Sh. Dhirubhai Ambani', 

      ', 

      ', 

    ', 

    ', Few  men in history have made as dramatic a contribution to their country\u2019s economic  fortunes as did the founder of Reliance, Sh. Dhirubhai H Ambani. Fewer still  have left behind a legacy that is more enduring and timeless.', 

    ', As with all great pioneers, there is more than one unique way of describing the  true genius of Dhirubhai: the corporate visionary, the unmatched strategist,  the proud patriot, the leader of men, the architect of India\u2019s capital markets, the  champion of shareholder interest.', 

    ', But the role Dhirubhai cherished most was perhaps that of India\u2019s greatest wealth creator. In  one lifetime, he built, starting from the proverbial scratch, India\u2019s largest private sector  enterprise. ', 

    ', When  Dhirubhai embarked on his first business venture, he had a seed capital of  barely US$ 300 (around Rs 14,000). Over the next three and a half decades, he  converted this fledgling enterprise into a Rs 60,000 crore colossus\u2014an  achievement which earned Reliance a place on the global Fortune 500 list, the  first ever Indian private company to do so. ', 

    ', Dhirubhai  is widely regarded as the father of India\u2019s capital markets. In 1977,  when Reliance Textile Industries Limited first went public, the Indian stock market  was a place patronised by a small club of elite investors which dabbled in a  handful of stocks.', 

    ', Undaunted,  Dhirubhai managed to convince a large number of first-time retail investors to  participate in the unfolding Reliance story and put their hard-earned money in  the Reliance Textile IPO, promising them, in exchange for their trust,  substantial return on their investments. It was to be the start of one of great  stories of mutual respect and reciprocal gain in the Indian markets. ', 

    ', Under  Dhirubhai\u2019s extraordinary vision and leadership, Reliance scripted one of the  greatest growth stories in corporate history anywhere in the world, and went on  to become India\u2019s  largest private sector enterprise.', 

    ', Through  out this amazing journey, Dhirubhai always kept the interests of the ordinary  shareholder uppermost in mind, in the process making millionaires out of many  of the initial investors in the Reliance stock, and creating one of the world\u2019s  largest shareholder families. ', 

    ', Click here for a fuller biography of Dhirubhai H Ambani', 

    ', A dream come true', 

    ', 

    ', The late Dhirubhai Ambani dreamt of a digital India  \u2014 an India  where the common man would have access to affordable means of information and  communication. Dhirubhai, who single-handedly built India\u2019s largest private sector  company virtually from scratch, had stated as early as 1999:',  \u201cMake the tools of  information and communication available to people at an affordable cost. They  will overcome the handicaps of illiteracy and lack of mobility.\u201d ', 

    ', It was with this belief in mind that Reliance Communications (formerly  Reliance Infocomm) started laying 60,000 route kilometres of a pan-India fibre  optic backbone. This backbone was commissioned on 28 December 2002, the  auspicious occasion of Dhirubhai\u2019s 70th birthday, though sadly after his  unexpected demise on 6 July 2002.', 

    ', Reliance Communications has a reliable, high-capacity, integrated (both  wireless and wireline) and convergent (voice, data and video) digital network.  It is capable of delivering a range of services spanning the entire infocomm  (information and communication) value chain, including infrastructure and  services \u2014 for enterprises as well as individuals, applications, and  consulting. ', 

    ', Today, Reliance Communications is revolutionising the way India  communicates and networks, truly bringing about a new way of life.', 

    ', Think big. Think different. Think ahead.', 

    ', 

    ', Dhirubhai preached \u2014 and personally practised \u2014 one mantra throughout  his life: Dream with conviction. ', 

    ', He built the Reliance empire from scratch and, in a short span of 25  years, it catapulted to become one of the top Fortune 500 corporations of the  world \u2014 an achievement unparalleled in history. ', 

    ', He was deeply rooted in traditional Indian values, and at the same time,  Dhirubhai possessed a very modern outlook - truly that of a 21st century  person. His corporate philosophy was short, simple and incredibly effective:  \u201cThink big. Think different. Think fast. Think ahead. Aim for the best.\u201d This  was clearly reflected in his passion for mega-sized projects, as well as his  fascination for cutting-edge technology and desire to always achieve the  highest possible productivity. At Reliance, Dhirubhai was a pillar of  inspiration for one and all. By practicing what he preached, he inspired and  encouraged everyone to surpass the best in the world. ', 

    ', Dhirubhai fully realised that true empowerment of the people is possible  only through education. Being an effective communicator, he continued to  inspire, guide, educate and motivate everyone through his communications. He  was a firm believer in the power of information and communication, and how it  can be utilised and turned to the advantage of one and all, by making time and  distance irrelevant. ', 

    ', He would always say that if a telephone call could be made cheaper than  a postcard, it would transform every home, empower every Indian, remove every  obstacle to opportunity and growth, and tear apart every barrier that divides  Indian society. He was convinced that infocom could energise enterprises,  drive governance, and render learning an interesting experience, apart from  making life exciting. ', 

    ', Keeping his conviction as our credo, Reliance Communications is  committed to transform Dhirubhai\u2019s dream into a reality. ',

        ', About Sh. Dhirubhai Ambani', 

      ', 

      ', 

    ', 

    ', Few  men in history have made as dramatic a contribution to their country\u2019s economic  fortunes as did the founder of Reliance, Sh. Dhirubhai H Ambani. Fewer still  have left behind a legacy that is more enduring and timeless.', 

    ', As with all great pioneers, there is more than one unique way of describing the  true genius of Dhirubhai: the corporate visionary, the unmatched strategist,  the proud patriot, the leader of men, the architect of India\u2019s capital markets, the  champion of shareholder interest.', 

    ', But the role Dhirubhai cherished most was perhaps that of India\u2019s greatest wealth creator. In  one lifetime, he built, starting from the proverbial scratch, India\u2019s largest private sector  enterprise. ', 

    ', When  Dhirubhai embarked on his first business venture, he had a seed capital of  barely US$ 300 (around Rs 14,000). Over the next three and a half decades, he  converted this fledgling enterprise into a Rs 60,000 crore colossus\u2014an  achievement which earned Reliance a place on the global Fortune 500 list, the  first ever Indian private company to do so. ', 

    ', Dhirubhai  is widely regarded as the father of India\u2019s capital markets. In 1977,  when Reliance Textile Industries Limited first went public, the Indian stock market  was a place patronised by a small club of elite investors which dabbled in a  handful of stocks.', 

    ', Undaunted,  Dhirubhai managed to convince a large number of first-time retail investors to  participate in the unfolding Reliance story and put their hard-earned money in  the Reliance Textile IPO, promising them, in exchange for their trust,  substantial return on their investments. It was to be the start of one of great  stories of mutual respect and reciprocal gain in the Indian markets. ', 

    ', Under  Dhirubhai\u2019s extraordinary vision and leadership, Reliance scripted one of the  greatest growth stories in corporate history anywhere in the world, and went on  to become India\u2019s  largest private sector enterprise.', 

    ', Through  out this amazing journey, Dhirubhai always kept the interests of the ordinary  shareholder uppermost in mind, in the process making millionaires out of many  of the initial investors in the Reliance stock, and creating one of the world\u2019s  largest shareholder families. ', 

    ', Click here for a fuller biography of Dhirubhai H Ambani', 

    ', A dream come true', 

    ', 

    ', The late Dhirubhai Ambani dreamt of a digital India  \u2014 an India  where the common man would have access to affordable means of information and  communication. Dhirubhai, who single-handedly built India\u2019s largest private sector  company virtually from scratch, had stated as early as 1999:',  \u201cMake the tools of  information and communication available to people at an affordable cost. They  will overcome the handicaps of illiteracy and lack of mobility.\u201d ', 

    ', It was with this belief in mind that Reliance Communications (formerly  Reliance Infocomm) started laying 60,000 route kilometres of a pan-India fibre  optic backbone. This backbone was commissioned on 28 December 2002, the  auspicious occasion of Dhirubhai\u2019s 70th birthday, though sadly after his  unexpected demise on 6 July 2002.', 

    ', Reliance Communications has a reliable, high-capacity, integrated (both  wireless and wireline) and convergent (voice, data and video) digital network.  It is capable of delivering a range of services spanning the entire infocomm  (information and communication) value chain, including infrastructure and  services \u2014 for enterprises as well as individuals, applications, and  consulting. ', 

    ', Today, Reliance Communications is revolutionising the way India  communicates and networks, truly bringing about a new way of life.', 

    ', Think big. Think different. Think ahead.', 

    ', 

    ', Dhirubhai preached \u2014 and personally practised \u2014 one mantra throughout  his life: Dream with conviction. ', 

    ', He built the Reliance empire from scratch and, in a short span of 25  years, it catapulted to become one of the top Fortune 500 corporations of the  world \u2014 an achievement unparalleled in history. ', 

    ', He was deeply rooted in traditional Indian values, and at the same time,  Dhirubhai possessed a very modern outlook - truly that of a 21st century  person. His corporate philosophy was short, simple and incredibly effective:  \u201cThink big. Think different. Think fast. Think ahead. Aim for the best.\u201d This  was clearly reflected in his passion for mega-sized projects, as well as his  fascination for cutting-edge technology and desire to always achieve the  highest possible productivity. At Reliance, Dhirubhai was a pillar of  inspiration for one and all. By practicing what he preached, he inspired and  encouraged everyone to surpass the best in the world. ', 

    ', Dhirubhai fully realised that true empowerment of the people is possible  only through education. Being an effective communicator, he continued to  inspire, guide, educate and motivate everyone through his communications. He  was a firm believer in the power of information and communication, and how it  can be utilised and turned to the advantage of one and all, by making time and  distance irrelevant. ', 

    ', He would always say that if a telephone call could be made cheaper than  a postcard, it would transform every home, empower every Indian, remove every  obstacle to opportunity and growth, and tear apart every barrier that divides  Indian society. He was convinced that infocom could energise enterprises,  drive governance, and render learning an interesting experience, apart from  making life exciting. ', 

    ', Keeping his conviction as our credo, Reliance Communications is  committed to transform Dhirubhai\u2019s dream into a reality. ',
