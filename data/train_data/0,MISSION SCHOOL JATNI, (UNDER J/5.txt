', The School of Architecture, Design & Planning will present its first Global Impact through Design Research Symposium Friday, April 22 in The Forum at Marvin Hall from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. All are welcome to attend this day of presentations documenting current research being done by faculty and graduate students. \u201cThe breadth of the research here in the school is extraordinary,\u201d Daas said. \u201cBut, as we often share what we are doing only informally, sometimes we are unaware of the specifics and depth of what our own colleagues are doing. We want to change that.\u201d', 

', Seventeen faculty and graduate students from all of the school\u2019s departments will make 20-minute presentations on topics such as healthcare design, urbanism, community participation and pedagogy, and building science and technology. In addition posters and artwork produced by faculty will be on display.', 

', \u201cIn bringing our colleagues together to present their research we are fulfilling one of the most important goals this same group set for itself during our visioning retreat last summer. That is to be the measure of excellence in design, teaching and research,\u201d said Dean Daas.',

', Julián Zugazagoitia, Director & CEO of The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Mo., and School of Architecture, Design & Planning Dean Mahesh Daas, will engage in a conversation on the use of architecture and design as tools for institutional leadership and transformation on March 23. The event will take place in The Forum at Marvin Hall at 10:15  a.m.', 

', The use of design as a change agent is a passion for both Zugazagotia and Dean Daas. Zugazagoitia was born in Mexico and educated at the Sorbonne and the Ecole du Louvre in France. While serving as the director and CEO of El Museo del Barrio in New York City, a leading institution in the field of Latin American and Latino art, he worked with the architecture firm Gruzen Samton to transformed the institution through a $44 million renovation project.', 

', Dean Daas is the author of ', Leading With Aesthetics: The Transformational Leadership of Charles M. Vest at MIT, ', and an Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture Distinguished Professor', . ', His book tells the story of Massachusetts Institute of Technology president Charles Vest. Vest\u2019s work with architects such as Frank Gehry, Steven Holl and Fumihiko Maki helped restore MIT\u2019s reputation as innovative and cutting edge, at a time when it had become conservative and staid.', 

', \u201cAn institution without its architecture is like a soul without a body or a person without a face,\u201d said Daas. \u201cLike Charles Vest, Julian Zugazagoitia is demonstrating how a principled leader, with a supportive and collaborative team can use architecture to engage and motivate people by helping articulate a common purpose and the highest expectations for excellence.', 

', \u201cWe are looking forward to a great conversation,\u201d he concluded.',

', The School of Architecture, Design & Planning will present its first Global Impact through Design Research Symposium Friday, April 22 in The Forum at Marvin Hall from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. All are welcome to attend this day of presentations documenting current research being done by faculty and graduate students. \u201cThe breadth of the research here in the school is extraordinary,\u201d Daas said. \u201cBut, as we often share what we are doing only informally, sometimes we are unaware of the specifics and depth of what our own colleagues are doing. We want to change that.\u201d', 

', Seventeen faculty and graduate students from all of the school\u2019s departments will make 20-minute presentations on topics such as healthcare design, urbanism, community participation and pedagogy, and building science and technology. In addition posters and artwork produced by faculty will be on display.', 

', \u201cIn bringing our colleagues together to present their research we are fulfilling one of the most important goals this same group set for itself during our visioning retreat last summer. That is to be the measure of excellence in design, teaching and research,\u201d said Dean Daas.',

', Julián Zugazagoitia, Director & CEO of The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Mo., and School of Architecture, Design & Planning Dean Mahesh Daas, will engage in a conversation on the use of architecture and design as tools for institutional leadership and transformation on March 23. The event will take place in The Forum at Marvin Hall at 10:15  a.m.', 

', The use of design as a change agent is a passion for both Zugazagotia and Dean Daas. Zugazagoitia was born in Mexico and educated at the Sorbonne and the Ecole du Louvre in France. While serving as the director and CEO of El Museo del Barrio in New York City, a leading institution in the field of Latin American and Latino art, he worked with the architecture firm Gruzen Samton to transformed the institution through a $44 million renovation project.', 

', Dean Daas is the author of ', Leading With Aesthetics: The Transformational Leadership of Charles M. Vest at MIT, ', and an Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture Distinguished Professor', . ', His book tells the story of Massachusetts Institute of Technology president Charles Vest. Vest\u2019s work with architects such as Frank Gehry, Steven Holl and Fumihiko Maki helped restore MIT\u2019s reputation as innovative and cutting edge, at a time when it had become conservative and staid.', 

', \u201cAn institution without its architecture is like a soul without a body or a person without a face,\u201d said Daas. \u201cLike Charles Vest, Julian Zugazagoitia is demonstrating how a principled leader, with a supportive and collaborative team can use architecture to engage and motivate people by helping articulate a common purpose and the highest expectations for excellence.', 

', \u201cWe are looking forward to a great conversation,\u201d he concluded.',

Attendees will learn about a surprising number of resources available from KCSourceLink, everything from help with conceptualization to financing.', 

', KCSourceLink\u2019s mission is to help small businesses in the Kansas City region grow and succeed. It provides small business with free, easy access to the help they need. The organization has also been leading the effort to make Kansas City America\u2019s most entrepreneurial city.', 

', \u201cEntrepreneurship and innovation through design-thinking are so much a part of what we do in our school that we wanted to take the opportunity to begin sharing the work we are doing in this area with the university community,\u201d said Dean Daas.',
