Infants continue sensory development by looking at contrasting patterns and at objects that are clearly defined by sharp edges and bright colors, while toddlers will build on their understanding of the light and dark concepts with play around daytime and nighttime. The older Discovery Preschool children will turn their attention to the sky as they learn about weather, the Moon, the Sun, and stars.', Children 4\u20135 years old: Transportation, Healthy Bodies, and Winter', For children in the Preschool and Kindergarten classrooms, January is filled with variety! They\u2019ll begin by learning about transportation and studying how things get from \u201chere\u201d to \u201cthere.\u201d A few weeks later, the focus will shift to health and bodies, with an emphasis placed on how to make good choices for a growing body. Towards the end of the month, children will be introduced to the transformative nature of the winter season and learn how to dress and take care of themselves when it\u2019s cold outside. ',

			', u"Our four-year-old daughter joined Green Valley KinderCare when we relocated to Henderson earlier this year. She had previous preschool experience and was placed in the preschool group. After a couple of weeks, we collectively discussed (center director, teachers, parents) her progress and decided to move her into the Prekindergarten Classroom. She did great and loves coming to school every day. Miss Virginia was a wonderful teacher and kept us informed of learning curriculum, how my daughter was progressing. The art projects were fantastic and educational. This fall, she remained in Prekindergarten because her birthday is in November and she won't begin Kindergarten until next fall.  Miss Tiffany, Miss Shayna, Miss Allison, Miss Lakisha are all so AWESOME!!! Sue, the center director, is easy to get in touch with and talk to. We've been so pleased with this place and are sorry to leave. We are relocating once again out of the area.",

Our son is now seven and still attends your summer and spring break programs. He was accepted last year for the first grade in a distinguished private school were only one out of four students are accepted. My husband and I attribute his entrance to the start he had the great staff.',

			', u"We are writing to express our gratitude for the extra time and attention Ms. Virginia afforded our son Boaz this year. Boaz' learning has improved remarkably over the past few years. Ms. Virginia took Boaz under her wing and made sure that he learned all his letters, his numbers and math concepts to prepare him for Kindergarten. Whenever we had a concern over something that we felt Boaz wasn't grasping, we could easily speak to her about it. If we had a complaint she was able to explain things to us and put them into perspective. She really listened to our concerns and tackled them, worked with him on them and we would notice the improvement right away. We have also noticed that she is always patient, not just with our son but with the other children in her class.", 
Ms. Virginia is one of the most extraordinary, dedicated professionals we have ever met. We are very impressed with her teaching ability, creativity and enthusiasm as well as the amount of care and attention she has given. Boaz is very lucky to have been her student this year, and it has truly been an honor getting to know her!',

			', My children have been students of the Green Valley KinderCare for the last five years, and have been happy at the school. They are treated with respect by their teachers and staff and have been properly educated to move forward into Kindergarten. My two children were prepared to read before they entered Kindergarten through the curriculum provided by the school. My children attend full time for the Preschool and Prekindergarten programs. Along with the personalized phonics program, KinderCare helped my children to transition and adapt to the elementary school environment by providing a structured schedule of activities similar to the elementary schools to make it easier for the children to transition to a new environment. The schedule included reading, phonics, math, art, music and free play. Thank you for helping our children prepare and succeed in school.',

			', u"My son Thomas attended KinderCare at 1901 N. Green Valley Parkway since he was a year old. He currently is in second grade at John C. Vanderberg Elementary School and is enrolled in KinderCare's after school program.", u"
I highly recommend the staff at the this KinderCare location. Since Thomas' enrollment many years ago, The entire staff have always been courteous, professional and, most importantly, extremely caring when it comes to looking after the children. I know the other parents feel the same way as I do because I see the same children year after year. It is an extremely family oriented school with many events scheduled to keep the kids and parents engaged with the school's goals of providing a nurturing environment. KinderCare is not a day care center, it is a place that is dedicated to expanding knowledge. During the summer break the curriculum consists of educational activities of exploration. In addition, teachers assign classwork geared towards my child's learning level to help him retain the skills attained the previous year and gear up for the upcoming school year.", u"
I highly recommend the staff at Green Valley KinderCare. They have been dependable and consistent with my son's care and education for many years.",
