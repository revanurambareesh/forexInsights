Newer renewable electricity sources are targeted to grow massively by 2022, including a more than doubling of India's large wind power capacity and an almost 15 fold increase in solar power from April 2016 levels. Such ambitious targets would place India amongst the world leaders in renewable energy use and place India at the centre of its ", International Solar Alliance',  project promoting the growth and development of solar power internationally to over 120 countries.', 
', India was the first country in the world to set up a ministry of ', non-conventional energy', u" resources, in early 1980s. As of September 30, 2016 India's cumulative grid interactive or grid tied renewable energy capacity (excluding large hydro) reached about 44.24 GW.", [1]', [2]', [3]',  61% of the renewable power came from ', wind', , while ', solar',  contributed nearly 19%.', [4]', [5]',  Large hydro installed capacity was 43.11 GW', [1]',  as of September 30, 2016 and is administered separately by the Ministry of Power and not included in MNRE targets.', 
', From 2015 onwards the MNRE began laying down actionable plans for the renewable energy sector under its ambit to make a quantum jump, building on strong foundations already established in the country.', [6]',  MNRE renewable electrictricity targets have been upscaled to grow from just under 43 GW in April 2016 to 175 GW by the year 2022, including 100 GW from solar power, 60 GW from wind power, 10 GW from bio power and 5 GW from small hydro power.', [6]',  The ambitious targets would see India quickly becoming one of the leading green energy producers in the world and surpassing numerous developed countries. The government intends to achieve 40% cumulative electric power capacity from non fossil fuel sources by 2030.', [6]',

', India is densely populated and has high solar ', insolation', , an ideal combination for using ', solar power',  in India. Much of the country does not have an ', electrical grid', u", so one of the first applications of solar power has been for water pumping, to begin replacing India's four to five million diesel powered ", water pumps', , each consuming about 3.5 kilowatts, and off-grid lighting. Some large projects have been proposed, and a 35,000 km² area of the ', Thar Desert',  has been set aside for ', solar power',  projects, sufficient to generate 700 to 2,100 ', gigawatts', .', 
', The Indian Solar Loan Programme, supported by the ', United Nations Environment Programme',  has won the prestigious ', Energy Globe',  World award for Sustainability for helping to establish a consumer financing program for solar home power systems. Over the span of three years more than 16,000 solar home systems have been financed through 2,000 bank branches, particularly in rural areas of South India where the ', electricity grid',  does not yet extend.', [21]', [22]', 
', u"Launched in 2003, the Indian Solar Loan Programme was a four-year partnership between UNEP, the UNEP Risoe Centre, and two of India's largest banks, the Canara Bank and Syndicate Bank.", [22]', 
', Announced in November 2009, the Government of India proposed to launch its ', Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission',  under the National Action Plan on Climate Change with plans to generate 1,000 MW of power by 2013 and up to 20,000 MW grid-based solar power, 2,000 MW of off-grid solar power and cover 20 million sq metres with collectors by the end of the final phase of the mission in 2020.', [23]',  The Mission aims to achieve grid parity (electricity delivered at the same cost and quality as that delivered on the grid) by 2020. Achieving this target would establish India as a global leader in solar power generation.', [24]',

', Waste to energy', [', edit', ]', 
', Every year, about 55 million tonnes of municipal solid waste (MSW) and 38 billion litres of sewage are generated in the urban areas of India. In addition, large quantities of solid and liquid wastes are generated by industries. Waste generation in India is expected to increase rapidly in the future. As more people migrate to urban areas and as incomes increase, consumption levels are likely to rise, as are rates of waste generation. It is estimated that the amount of waste generated in India will increase at a per capita rate of approximately 1-1.33% annually. This has significant impacts on the amount of land that is and will be needed for disposal, economic costs of collecting and transporting waste, and the environmental consequences of increased MSW generation levels. ', Waste Energy In India', [25]', 
', India has had a long involvement with ', anaerobic digestion',  and ', biogas',  technologies. Waste water treatment plants in the country have been established which produce renewable energy from sewage gas, however there is significant un-tapped potential.', [26]',  Also wastes from the distillery sector are on some sites converted into biogas to run in a ', gas engine',  to generate onsite power.',

Newer renewable electricity sources are targeted to grow massively by 2022, including a more than doubling of India's large wind power capacity and an almost 15 fold increase in solar power from April 2016 levels. Such ambitious targets would place India amongst the world leaders in renewable energy use and place India at the centre of its ", International Solar Alliance',  project promoting the growth and development of solar power internationally to over 120 countries.', 
', India was the first country in the world to set up a ministry of ', non-conventional energy', u" resources, in early 1980s. As of September 30, 2016 India's cumulative grid interactive or grid tied renewable energy capacity (excluding large hydro) reached about 44.24 GW.", [1]', [2]', [3]',  61% of the renewable power came from ', wind', , while ', solar',  contributed nearly 19%.', [4]', [5]',  Large hydro installed capacity was 43.11 GW', [1]',  as of September 30, 2016 and is administered separately by the Ministry of Power and not included in MNRE targets.', 
', From 2015 onwards the MNRE began laying down actionable plans for the renewable energy sector under its ambit to make a quantum jump, building on strong foundations already established in the country.', [6]',  MNRE renewable electrictricity targets have been upscaled to grow from just under 43 GW in April 2016 to 175 GW by the year 2022, including 100 GW from solar power, 60 GW from wind power, 10 GW from bio power and 5 GW from small hydro power.', [6]',  The ambitious targets would see India quickly becoming one of the leading green energy producers in the world and surpassing numerous developed countries. The government intends to achieve 40% cumulative electric power capacity from non fossil fuel sources by 2030.', [6]',

Much of the country does not have an ', electrical grid', u", so one of the first applications of solar power has been for water pumping, to begin replacing India's four to five million diesel powered ", water pumps', , each consuming about 3.5 kilowatts, and off-grid lighting. Some large projects have been proposed, and a 35,000 km² area of the ', Thar Desert',  has been set aside for ', solar power',  projects, sufficient to generate 700 to 2,100 ', gigawatts', .', 
', The Indian Solar Loan Programme, supported by the ', United Nations Environment Programme',  has won the prestigious ', Energy Globe',  World award for Sustainability for helping to establish a consumer financing program for solar home power systems. Over the span of three years more than 16,000 solar home systems have been financed through 2,000 bank branches, particularly in rural areas of South India where the ', electricity grid',  does not yet extend.', [21]', [22]', 
', u"Launched in 2003, the Indian Solar Loan Programme was a four-year partnership between UNEP, the UNEP Risoe Centre, and two of India's largest banks, the Canara Bank and Syndicate Bank.", [22]', 
', Announced in November 2009, the Government of India proposed to launch its ', Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission',  under the National Action Plan on Climate Change with plans to generate 1,000 MW of power by 2013 and up to 20,000 MW grid-based solar power, 2,000 MW of off-grid solar power and cover 20 million sq metres with collectors by the end of the final phase of the mission in 2020.', [23]',  The Mission aims to achieve grid parity (electricity delivered at the same cost and quality as that delivered on the grid) by 2020. Achieving this target would establish India as a global leader in solar power generation.', [24]',

', Waste to energy', [', edit', ]', 
', Every year, about 55 million tonnes of municipal solid waste (MSW) and 38 billion litres of sewage are generated in the urban areas of India. In addition, large quantities of solid and liquid wastes are generated by industries. Waste generation in India is expected to increase rapidly in the future. As more people migrate to urban areas and as incomes increase, consumption levels are likely to rise, as are rates of waste generation. It is estimated that the amount of waste generated in India will increase at a per capita rate of approximately 1-1.33% annually. This has significant impacts on the amount of land that is and will be needed for disposal, economic costs of collecting and transporting waste, and the environmental consequences of increased MSW generation levels. ', Waste Energy In India', [25]', 
', India has had a long involvement with ', anaerobic digestion',  and ', biogas',  technologies. Waste water treatment plants in the country have been established which produce renewable energy from sewage gas, however there is significant un-tapped potential.', [26]',  Also wastes from the distillery sector are on some sites converted into biogas to run in a ', gas engine',  to generate onsite power.',
