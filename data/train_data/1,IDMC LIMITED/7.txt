			Over time, IDMC\u2019s Make in India initiative has led to a significant growth in its manufacturing base and reduced the dependence of the domestic dairy industry on the import of a large number of diverse dairy equipment.  IDMC\u2019s metal fabrication and machining facilities are spread over approximately 21,000 square metres.  The company\u2019s automatic polishing facility together with water jet cutting and dish spinning facilities provide uniform surface finish on vessels and a cutting edge in job quality.

			IDMC\u2019s packaging division has a capacity to manufacture about 12000 tons of poly films and laminates.  After adding a second contemporary blown film plant, a ten-colour CI flexographic printing machine and a rotogravure printing machine, IDMC has emerged as one of the large domestic players in this sector. The plant is capable of manufacturing three-layer blown film with minimum thickness tolerance for use in various industries such as dairy, food and beverages, bakery, confectionery, cosmetic, edible oils, cereals, personal care products and pharmaceuticals.
