                            strength alone, but by its performance. Tracing back
                            the history of the origin of chit funds reveals that
                            they evolved at a time when banking facilities had
                            not developed, thus filling an important credit gap
                            in the economy. But with the growth of banks, chit
                            funds were doomed to closure. However, on the
                            contrary, vast expansions in the chit fund business
                            were witnessed over the years, neck to neck with
                            that of the banking system. Proof enough that chit
                            funds continue to fill the credit gap in the
                            developing economy of our country. Today chit fund
                            companies are recognized as important credit and

                            strength alone, but by its performance. Tracing back
                            the history of the origin of chit funds reveals that
                            they evolved at a time when banking facilities had
                            not developed, thus filling an important credit gap
                            in the economy. But with the growth of banks, chit
                            funds were doomed to closure. However, on the
                            contrary, vast expansions in the chit fund business
                            were witnessed over the years, neck to neck with
                            that of the banking system. Proof enough that chit
                            funds continue to fill the credit gap in the
                            developing economy of our country. Today chit fund

                            without deduction of the amount. It is a good
                            practice if the Foreman ploughs back the entire
                            prize amount into the chit business to meet his
