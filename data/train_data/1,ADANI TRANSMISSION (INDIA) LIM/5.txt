Singapore, October 06, 2016 -- Moody's Investors Service says that Adani Transmission Limited's 
(Baa3 stable, ATL) announced acquisition of the transmission assets 
of Reliance Infrastructure (unrated) which is valued at around INR 19.0 
billion, is manageable within its rating, and as such the 
Baa3 rating is not affected by the transaction. The transaction 
is however credit negative because the incremental debt that is associated 
with the acquired entity will weaken financial metrics and reduce the 
headroom within ATL's rating, as well as reduce cash liquidity 
which is being used to fund the transaction.
", 
', 
', 
', u"
ATL has signed a binding term sheet with Reliance Infrastructure to acquire 
three inter-state transmission lines. The acquisition is 
subject to statutory and regulatory approvals and ATL expects that the 
transaction will complete by 1QFY2018. The assets being acquired 
comprise approximately 3,500 circuit kilometers of transmission 
lines. All three transmission lines are operational and as such 
carry no construction risk. ATL would be acquiring 100% 
stake in two transmission lines and 74% stake in the third line 
in which 26% stake is held by Power Grid Corporation of India Limited 
(PGCIL, unrated). The transmission revenue for all three 
assets are collected by PGCIL as a part of a pooling mechanism which partly 
mitigates the counter party risk similar to ATL's existing inter-state 
transmission lines.
", 
', 
', 
', 
"To the extent that the acquisition proceeds on the terms announced, 
we expect ATL's Funds from Operations/ Adjusted net debt over the 
next 12-18 months to be in the range of 9% -11%, 
which is within the rating minimum tolerance of 7%", 
says Abhishek Tyagi, a Moody's Vice President and Senior Analyst.
', 
', 
', 
', u"
The proposed transaction, which follows the recently announced acquisition 
of GMR Energy's (unrated) transmission assets in July 2016, 
highlights ATL's inorganic growth aspiration which raises the level 
of business risk.
", 
', 
', 
', u"
ATL's rating could be downgraded if it undertakes aggressive expansion, 
or if revenues from non-transmission business rise consistently 
above 25% of total revenues. Financial metrics that could 
prompt a downgrade include: FFO Interest Coverage Ratio falling 
below 1.75x, and FFO/ and Net Debt declining below 7% 
on a sustained basis.
", 
', 
', 
', u"
On the other hand, the ratings are unlikely to be upgraded in the 
near term, based on the company's business profile and financial 
strategy. Over time, the rating could be upgraded if ATL 
assumes a prudent growth strategy that is underpinned by conservative 
financial leverage, while maintaining non-transmission business 
at the expected 15%-20% level. Financial metrics 
that Moody's would look for include FFO/Net Debt and FFO Interest coverage 
exceeding 20%-25% and 2.5x respectively on 
a consistent basis.
", 
', 
', 
', 
The principal methodology used in these ratings was Regulated Electric 
and Gas Networks published in November 2014. Please see the Rating 
Methodologies page on www.moodys.com for a copy of this 
methodology.
', 
', 
', 
', u"
ATL, based in Ahmedabad, is the largest private-sector 
participant in India's power transmission chain. Through its two 
100%-owned subsidiaries - Maharashtra Eastern Grid 
Power Transmission Company Limited (MEGPTCL) and Adani Transmission (India) 
Limited (ATIL), ATL operates four transmission lines around the 
country with a network of more than 5,000 circuit kilometers.

(\u201cMJKK\u201d) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody's Group Japan G.K., which is wholly-owned by Moody\u2019s Overseas Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCO. Moody\u2019s SF Japan K.K. (\u201cMSFJ\u201d) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (\u201cNRSRO\u201d). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings.

MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. ", MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. ', MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements. ',

Singapore, October 06, 2016 -- Moody's Investors Service says that Adani Transmission Limited's 
(Baa3 stable, ATL) announced acquisition of the transmission assets 
of Reliance Infrastructure (unrated) which is valued at around INR 19.0 
billion, is manageable within its rating, and as such the 
Baa3 rating is not affected by the transaction. The transaction 
is however credit negative because the incremental debt that is associated 
with the acquired entity will weaken financial metrics and reduce the 
headroom within ATL's rating, as well as reduce cash liquidity 
which is being used to fund the transaction.
", 
', 
', 
', u"
ATL has signed a binding term sheet with Reliance Infrastructure to acquire 
three inter-state transmission lines. The acquisition is 
subject to statutory and regulatory approvals and ATL expects that the 
transaction will complete by 1QFY2018. The assets being acquired 
comprise approximately 3,500 circuit kilometers of transmission 
lines. All three transmission lines are operational and as such 
carry no construction risk. ATL would be acquiring 100% 
stake in two transmission lines and 74% stake in the third line 
in which 26% stake is held by Power Grid Corporation of India Limited 
(PGCIL, unrated). The transmission revenue for all three 
assets are collected by PGCIL as a part of a pooling mechanism which partly 
mitigates the counter party risk similar to ATL's existing inter-state 
transmission lines.
", 
', 
', 
', 
"To the extent that the acquisition proceeds on the terms announced, 
we expect ATL's Funds from Operations/ Adjusted net debt over the 
next 12-18 months to be in the range of 9% -11%, 
which is within the rating minimum tolerance of 7%", 
says Abhishek Tyagi, a Moody's Vice President and Senior Analyst.
', 
', 
', 
', u"
The proposed transaction, which follows the recently announced acquisition 
of GMR Energy's (unrated) transmission assets in July 2016, 
highlights ATL's inorganic growth aspiration which raises the level 
of business risk.
", 
', 
', 
', u"
ATL's rating could be downgraded if it undertakes aggressive expansion, 
or if revenues from non-transmission business rise consistently 
above 25% of total revenues. Financial metrics that could 
prompt a downgrade include: FFO Interest Coverage Ratio falling 
below 1.75x, and FFO/ and Net Debt declining below 7% 
on a sustained basis.
", 
', 
', 
', u"
On the other hand, the ratings are unlikely to be upgraded in the 
near term, based on the company's business profile and financial 
strategy. Over time, the rating could be upgraded if ATL 
assumes a prudent growth strategy that is underpinned by conservative 
financial leverage, while maintaining non-transmission business 
at the expected 15%-20% level. Financial metrics 
that Moody's would look for include FFO/Net Debt and FFO Interest coverage 
exceeding 20%-25% and 2.5x respectively on 
a consistent basis.
", 
', 
', 
', 
The principal methodology used in these ratings was Regulated Electric 
and Gas Networks published in November 2014. Please see the Rating 
Methodologies page on www.moodys.com for a copy of this 
methodology.
', 
', 
', 
', u"
ATL, based in Ahmedabad, is the largest private-sector 
participant in India's power transmission chain. Through its two 
100%-owned subsidiaries - Maharashtra Eastern Grid 
Power Transmission Company Limited (MEGPTCL) and Adani Transmission (India) 
Limited (ATIL), ATL operates four transmission lines around the 
country with a network of more than 5,000 circuit kilometers.
