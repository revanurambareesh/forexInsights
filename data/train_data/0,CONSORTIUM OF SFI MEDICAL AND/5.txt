', The  objectivity of research is of paramount importance and the basis for obtaining  and maintaining public trust.  To address the increasing complexities of the  financial interests held by biomedical and behavioral researchers and the  resulting interactions among Government, research Institutions, and the private  sector, the Public Health Service (PHS) and the Office of the Secretary of the  U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) published revised  regulations on the ', Responsibility of  Applicants for Promoting Objectivity in Research for which PHS Funding is  Sought ', and',  Responsible Prospective  Contractors',  (commonly known as the Financial Conflict of Interest (FCOI)  regulations).  These regulations establish  new standards and clarify previously established standards to be followed by  Institutions that apply for or receive research funding from PHS Awarding Components,  including the National Institutes of Health (NIH), for grants, cooperative  agreements, and research contracts.  The  2011 revised regulations were written to increase accountability, add  transparency, enhance regulatory compliance and effective Institutional  management of Investigators\u2019 financial conflicts of interest, and strengthen  NIH\u2019s compliance oversight.  The primary  goal is to promote objectivity by establishing standards that provide a  reasonable expectation that the design, conduct, and reporting of research  funded under PHS grants, cooperative agreements and contracts will be free from  bias resulting from Investigator financial conflicts of interest.   ', 
',   As part of NIH\u2019s continuing efforts to provide useful  resources for extramural recipients, we compiled answers to the most frequently  asked questions regarding the implementation of the revised regulations for  grants and cooperative agreements.  The questions are arranged by topic,  indicating to whom (Institution and/or Investigator) they pertain. The purpose  of the FAQs is to clarify issues that may arise and will assist Institutions as  they develop and/or revise an Institution\u2019s FCOI policy that meets or exceeds  the requirements of the regulation; the FAQs pertain only to grants and  cooperative agreements.  Questions  regarding the applicability and/or compliance with the revised contract  regulation provided at ', 45 CFR  Part 94',  should be directed to ', fcoicontracts@mail.nih.gov', .',

', 
  ', 
   ',  ', The definition of Significant Financial Interest under the 2011 revised regulation differs from the 1995 definition of Significant Financial Interest in a number of respects.', 
', 
', Institutional responsibilities: ', 
', 
', Under the 2011 FCOI regulation,',  ', Significant Financial Interests that are subject to disclosure by an Investigator to an Institution are those that reasonably appear to be related to the Investigator\u2019s \u2018\u2018Institutional responsibilities,\u201d as defined by the Institution. As a result, when read in conjunction with the revised Investigator disclosure requirements under 42 CFR 50.604, the revised Significant Financial Interest definition results in the disclosure by Investigators to Institutions of a wider array of interests on a more frequent basis. In addition to their own, Investigators are required to disclose the Significant Financial Interests of his/her spouse and dependent children.', 
', Under the 1995 regulation, Investigators were required to disclose their Significant Financial Interests related to their PHS-funded research.', 
', 
', Monetary threshold: ', 
', 
', The 2011 Significant Financial Interest definition lowers the de minimis threshold to $5,000 and, in some circumstances, eliminates the existing monetary thresholds for disclosure. ', 
', Under the 1995 FCOI regulation, a Significant Financial Interest did not include an equity interest that, when aggregated for the Investigator and the Investigator\u2019s spouse and dependent children, met both of the following tests: Did not exceed $10,000 in value and did not represent more than a five percent (5%) ownership interest in any single entity.  Similarly, a Significant Financial Interest did not include payments (', e.g., ', salary) that, when aggregated for the Investigator and the Investigator\u2019s spouse and dependent children over the next twelve months, were not expected to exceed $10,000. ', 
', The 2011 definition also differentiates between remuneration to the Investigator (and the Investigator\u2019s spouse and dependent children) from a publicly traded entity and remuneration from a non-publicly traded entity.  With regard to a publicly traded entity, a monetary threshold of $5,000 applies to the aggregated amount of any remuneration received from the entity in the twelve months preceding disclosure and the value of any equity interest as of the date of disclosure.  With regard to a non-publicly traded entity, a Significant Financial Interest exists if the value of any remuneration received from the entity in the twelve months preceding the disclosure, when aggregated, exceeds $5,000, or when the Investigator (or the Investigator\u2019s spouse or dependent children) holds any equity interest (e.g., stock, stock option, or other ownership interest). ', 
', 
', Timing: ', 
', 
', The revised Significant Financial Interest definition changes the timing for determining whether remuneration represents a Significant Financial Interest. ', 
', The 1995 regulation excluded aggregated payments (including salary and royalties) that were \u2018\u2018not expected to exceed\u2019\u2019 the monetary threshold \u2018\u2018over the next twelve months.\u2019\u2019 ', 
', Under the 2011 definition, at issue is any remuneration received from an entity \u2018\u2018in the twelve months preceding the disclosure and the value of any publicly traded equity interest in the entity as of the date of disclosure, when aggregated, exceeds $5,000.\u201d', 
', 
', Examples of payment for services:', 
', 
', The 1995 definition referenced as examples of payments for services receipt of consulting fees or honoraria. ', 
', The 2011 revised regulation adds \u2018\u2018paid authorship\u2019\u2019 as an additional example of payment for services.', 
', 
', Royalties & Intellectual Property:',  ', 
', 
', Under the 1995 regulation, royalties were subject to the $10,000 threshold if not received from the applicant institution. ', 
', Under the 2011 revised regulation, the preamble clarifies that a threshold of $5,000 applies to licensed intellectual property rights (e.g., patents, copyrights), royalties from such rights, and agreements to share in royalties related to licensed intellectual property rights (see page 53265.)  However, intellectual property rights assigned to the Institution and agreements to share in royalties related to such rights are still excluded from the Significant Financial Interest definition. ', 
', 
', Reimbursed or Sponsored Travel:', 
', 
', Under the 1995 regulation, there was no specific requirement to disclose reimbursed or sponsored travel.', 
', Under the 2011 revised regulation, and with the express exceptions noted therein, Investigators must disclose the occurrence of any reimbursed or sponsored travel (i.e., that which is paid on behalf of the Investigator and not reimbursed to the Investigator so that the exact monetary value may not be readily available) related to the Investigator\u2019s institutional responsibilities as prescribed by the Institution\u2019s Financial Conflict of Interest (FCOI) policy (i.e., specify the details of the disclosure which will include, at a minimum, the purpose of the trip, the identity of the sponsor/organizer, the destination, and the duration).  The institutional official will determine if further information is needed, including a determination or disclosure of monetary value, in order to determine whether the travel constitutes an FCOI with PHS-funded research. This disclosure is addressed in the definition of \u201cSignificant Financial Interest,\u201d (SFI) which makes it subject to the following considerations:', 
',  (1)  Investigators who are planning to participate in PHS-funded research must disclose their SFIs over the previous  twelve-month period to their Institution no later than at the time of application for PHS-funded research. ', 
', (2)  Each Investigator who is participating in PHS-funded research must submit an updated disclosure of SFIs at least annually, in accordance with the specific time period prescribed by the Institution, during the period of award.', 
', (3)  Each Investigator who is participating in the PHS-funded research must submit an updated disclosure of SFIs within 30 days of discovering or acquiring a new SFI.', 
', 
', Exclusions: ', 
', 
', The 2011 revised regulation modifies',  ', the types of interests that are specifically excluded from the Significant Financial Interest definition.  The exclusions are: ', 
', 
', 
', salary, royalties, or other remuneration paid by the Institution to the Investigator if the Investigator is currently employed or otherwise appointed by the Institution; ',

   ',  ', Yes.',  ', In recognition of the different needs and resources of the diverse Institutions funded by the PHS, the regulation seeks to maximize Institutions\u2019 flexibility and minimize administrative burden by deferring to the Institutions\u2019 FCOI policies to prescribe the details of the Investigator\u2019s disclosure of sponsored or reimbursed travel and the protocol that Institutions should use to review Investigators\u2019 sponsored or reimbursed travel disclosures, as long as such details and protocol are consistent with  the regulation.  The following are several illustrations of how the Institution may \u201cprescribe the details of disclosure\u201d in its FCOI policy: ', 
', a.    Institutions may prescribe the timing of disclosures.', 
', The 2011 revised regulation requires that Investigators submit an updated disclosure of SFIs at least annually, as prescribed by the Institution, during the period of award.  Annual updated disclosures include any information that was not disclosed initially to the Institution or in a subsequent disclosure of SFIs.   An updated SFI disclosure must be made within 30 days of discovering or acquiring the new SFI.  However, the rule does not require that each SFI be disclosed individually.  Thus, an Institution has flexibility to prescribe the timing of disclosures. ', 
', For example, an Institution could require Investigators to disclose their planned or anticipated reimbursed or sponsored travel in a prospective manner (e.g., over the next twelve months) at the time of the annual update of financial disclosures or at another time of the Institution\u2019s choosing, with a requirement to update the details of the travel annually.  Once the Investigator has disclosed planned sponsored or reimbursed travel in this manner, the Investigator would have met the regulatory requirement to disclose it and would not have to disclose it again \u201cwithin 30 days\u201d of the travel (assuming there were no changes to the threshold reporting details of purpose of the trip, identity of the sponsor/organizer, destination, and duration).    It should be noted, however, that under such an Institutional policy, an Investigator would continue to be required to disclose a new source of travel (i.e., that was not anticipated and disclosed at the annual reporting) within 30 days, as required by the regulation.', 
', b.     ', Institutions may prescribe the details of review requirements in their FCOI policy.', 
', Institutions are required to determine if Investigators\u2019 reimbursed or sponsored travel constitutes an FCOI; however, Institutions have the discretion to determine which details of the sponsored or reimbursed travel, for example, source of funding, destination, duration of travel, etc., drive further institutional review.  We note that the Preamble to the Final Rule states, \u201c\u2026depending on the source of funding and other circumstances (e.g., destination, duration) of specific travel, the Institution may consider whether that sponsored travel could affect the design, conduct, or reporting of PHS-funded research.\u201d ', 
', For example, an Institution could determine that Investigator travel to participate in annual meetings of professional societies or Gordon Conferences, while requiring disclosure in accordance with the regulatory requirements, may not require further institutional review to determine if the travel constitutes a FCOI. ', 
', c.     ', Institutions may prescribe the details of Investigator disclosure.',  ', 
', Institutions may prescribe the details of the disclosure of sponsored or reimbursed travel that are consistent with the requirements of the 2011 revised regulation.  The 2011 revised regulation requires that such disclosure must include the purpose of the trip, the identity of the sponsor/organizer, the destination, and the duration.  Institutions have discretion under the 2011 revised regulation to prescribe what other details, if any, are appropriate to particular travel-related disclosures or categories of disclosures.  ', 
', For example, Institutions may, within the discretion afforded by the Final Rule, impose the $5,000 de minimis threshold that is required for disclosure of other types of financial interests within the regulatory definition of SFI, Institutions could apply the de minimis threshold when aggregated per entity.  ',  ',  ',

The Annual Report link will not appear if the Original Report is submitted on or after the annual ', progress',  report due date within the current budget period.  See FAQs H.34 and 35 for Annual Report links applicable to grant extensions and FAQs H.39. and H.40. for Annual Report links applicable to Original Reports submitted on or after the progress report due date.',  ',

', The  objectivity of research is of paramount importance and the basis for obtaining  and maintaining public trust.  To address the increasing complexities of the  financial interests held by biomedical and behavioral researchers and the  resulting interactions among Government, research Institutions, and the private  sector, the Public Health Service (PHS) and the Office of the Secretary of the  U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) published revised  regulations on the ', Responsibility of  Applicants for Promoting Objectivity in Research for which PHS Funding is  Sought ', and',  Responsible Prospective  Contractors',  (commonly known as the Financial Conflict of Interest (FCOI)  regulations).  These regulations establish  new standards and clarify previously established standards to be followed by  Institutions that apply for or receive research funding from PHS Awarding Components,  including the National Institutes of Health (NIH), for grants, cooperative  agreements, and research contracts.  The  2011 revised regulations were written to increase accountability, add  transparency, enhance regulatory compliance and effective Institutional  management of Investigators\u2019 financial conflicts of interest, and strengthen  NIH\u2019s compliance oversight.  The primary  goal is to promote objectivity by establishing standards that provide a  reasonable expectation that the design, conduct, and reporting of research  funded under PHS grants, cooperative agreements and contracts will be free from  bias resulting from Investigator financial conflicts of interest.   ', 
',   As part of NIH\u2019s continuing efforts to provide useful  resources for extramural recipients, we compiled answers to the most frequently  asked questions regarding the implementation of the revised regulations for  grants and cooperative agreements.  The questions are arranged by topic,  indicating to whom (Institution and/or Investigator) they pertain. The purpose  of the FAQs is to clarify issues that may arise and will assist Institutions as  they develop and/or revise an Institution\u2019s FCOI policy that meets or exceeds  the requirements of the regulation; the FAQs pertain only to grants and  cooperative agreements.  Questions  regarding the applicability and/or compliance with the revised contract  regulation provided at ', 45 CFR  Part 94',  should be directed to ', fcoicontracts@mail.nih.gov', .',

', The 2011 definition also differentiates between remuneration to the Investigator (and the Investigator\u2019s spouse and dependent children) from a publicly traded entity and remuneration from a non-publicly traded entity.  With regard to a publicly traded entity, a monetary threshold of $5,000 applies to the aggregated amount of any remuneration received from the entity in the twelve months preceding disclosure and the value of any equity interest as of the date of disclosure.  With regard to a non-publicly traded entity, a Significant Financial Interest exists if the value of any remuneration received from the entity in the twelve months preceding the disclosure, when aggregated, exceeds $5,000, or when the Investigator (or the Investigator\u2019s spouse or dependent children) holds any equity interest (e.g., stock, stock option, or other ownership interest). ', 
', 
', Timing: ', 
', 
', The revised Significant Financial Interest definition changes the timing for determining whether remuneration represents a Significant Financial Interest. ', 
', The 1995 regulation excluded aggregated payments (including salary and royalties) that were \u2018\u2018not expected to exceed\u2019\u2019 the monetary threshold \u2018\u2018over the next twelve months.\u2019\u2019 ', 
', Under the 2011 definition, at issue is any remuneration received from an entity \u2018\u2018in the twelve months preceding the disclosure and the value of any publicly traded equity interest in the entity as of the date of disclosure, when aggregated, exceeds $5,000.\u201d', 
', 
', Examples of payment for services:', 
', 
', The 1995 definition referenced as examples of payments for services receipt of consulting fees or honoraria. ', 
', The 2011 revised regulation adds \u2018\u2018paid authorship\u2019\u2019 as an additional example of payment for services.', 
', 
', Royalties & Intellectual Property:',  ', 
', 
', Under the 1995 regulation, royalties were subject to the $10,000 threshold if not received from the applicant institution. ', 
', Under the 2011 revised regulation, the preamble clarifies that a threshold of $5,000 applies to licensed intellectual property rights (e.g., patents, copyrights), royalties from such rights, and agreements to share in royalties related to licensed intellectual property rights (see page 53265.)  However, intellectual property rights assigned to the Institution and agreements to share in royalties related to such rights are still excluded from the Significant Financial Interest definition. ', 
', 
', Reimbursed or Sponsored Travel:', 
', 
', Under the 1995 regulation, there was no specific requirement to disclose reimbursed or sponsored travel.', 
', Under the 2011 revised regulation, and with the express exceptions noted therein, Investigators must disclose the occurrence of any reimbursed or sponsored travel (i.e., that which is paid on behalf of the Investigator and not reimbursed to the Investigator so that the exact monetary value may not be readily available) related to the Investigator\u2019s institutional responsibilities as prescribed by the Institution\u2019s Financial Conflict of Interest (FCOI) policy (i.e., specify the details of the disclosure which will include, at a minimum, the purpose of the trip, the identity of the sponsor/organizer, the destination, and the duration).  The institutional official will determine if further information is needed, including a determination or disclosure of monetary value, in order to determine whether the travel constitutes an FCOI with PHS-funded research. This disclosure is addressed in the definition of \u201cSignificant Financial Interest,\u201d (SFI) which makes it subject to the following considerations:', 
',  (1)  Investigators who are planning to participate in PHS-funded research must disclose their SFIs over the previous  twelve-month period to their Institution no later than at the time of application for PHS-funded research. ', 
', (2)  Each Investigator who is participating in PHS-funded research must submit an updated disclosure of SFIs at least annually, in accordance with the specific time period prescribed by the Institution, during the period of award.', 
', (3)  Each Investigator who is participating in the PHS-funded research must submit an updated disclosure of SFIs within 30 days of discovering or acquiring a new SFI.', 
', 
', Exclusions: ', 
', 
', The 2011 revised regulation modifies',  ', the types of interests that are specifically excluded from the Significant Financial Interest definition.  The exclusions are: ', 
', 
', 
', salary, royalties, or other remuneration paid by the Institution to the Investigator if the Investigator is currently employed or otherwise appointed by the Institution; ', 
', intellectual property rights assigned to the Institution and agreements to share in royalties related to such rights', 
', any ownership interests in the Institution held by the Investigator, if the Institution is a commercial or for-profit organization', 
', income from investment vehicles, such as mutual funds and retirement accounts, as long as the Investigator does not directly control the investment decisions made in these vehicles;', 
', income from seminars, lectures, or teaching engagements sponsored by a federal, state, or local government agency, an Institution of higher education as defined in 20 U.S.C. 1001(a), an academic teaching hospital, a medical center, or a research institute that is affiliated with an institution of higher education; ', 
', income from service on advisory committees or review panels for a federal, state, or local government agency, or an Institution of higher education as defined at 20 U.S.C. 1001(a), an academic teaching hospital, a medical center, or a research institute that is affiliated with an institution of higher education.',

In addition, the SBIR/STTR applicant exclusion under the 1995 regulation was broadened to include any ownership interest in the Institution held by the Investigator, if the Institution is a commercial or for-profit organization (whether or not an SBIR/STTR applicant). ',

', a.    Institutions may prescribe the timing of disclosures.', 
', The 2011 revised regulation requires that Investigators submit an updated disclosure of SFIs at least annually, as prescribed by the Institution, during the period of award.  Annual updated disclosures include any information that was not disclosed initially to the Institution or in a subsequent disclosure of SFIs.   An updated SFI disclosure must be made within 30 days of discovering or acquiring the new SFI.  However, the rule does not require that each SFI be disclosed individually.  Thus, an Institution has flexibility to prescribe the timing of disclosures. ',
