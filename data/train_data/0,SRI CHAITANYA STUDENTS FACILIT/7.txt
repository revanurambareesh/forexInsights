			', Hello Sir,',

My Nephew is studying inter 1yr in your college at Kukatpally branch. Student is average and it was communicated initially when associate has been arrived to our come and even they have force us to join in this college. My nephew was influenced by someone and he took Bi.P.C and after one month he was panicked with the syllabus and he chooses MPC and we parents spoke to Principal and he accepted the student to move to MPC and asked us to return the books. However, we have not received the booked till the month of October even requesting many times and principal was keep giving excuses on these issue and management and lectures are forcing my nephew to get books and also they were not attending or sit in the class without books and my nephew was totally depressed with these situation and got demoralized. We have xeroxed all the books by spending nearly 4k. Unfortunately my nephew was met with an accident and his leg got welted and unable to climb 4 floors at your college and requested for an assistance to climb the step even for this management has not helps him and in the next day he was unable to walk and we informed principal on this situation and he was on leave for 1 and half week and when he been to college, management has sent him home due to log leave and not informing to DEAN which we do not know about this. We parents went to college and spoke to them and showed all the doctor proscriptions but still they have not permitted and asked us meet the dean of the college. We went to meet the dean pertaining to this issue nextday. Principal is too rude and impolite to us and he stopped us to meet the dean and told us to keep stay back our nephew in home and told him to learn from home by him self with out attending college and now they have provided the books to him and told to attend the final exams by paying full fee and these things has forcefully took a written letter from us by pretending us to take the TC.', 
Principal has demotivating and demoralizing the my nephew and cornering him in front of all the students and also the principal was showing the andhra and telangana discrimination towards the students and where my nephew was totally depressed and disturbed and also he is loosing concentration on studies.

			', Hello Sir,', 
', 
My Nephew is studying inter 1yr in your college at Kukatpally branch. Student is average and it was communicated initially when associate has been arrived to our come and even they have force us to join in this college. My nephew was influenced by someone and he took Bi.P.C and after one month he was panicked with the syllabus and he chooses MPC and we parents spoke to Principal and he accepted the student to move to MPC and asked us to return the books. However, we have not received the booked till the month of October even requesting many times and principal was keep giving excuses on these issue and management and lectures are forcing my nephew to get books and also they were not attending or sit in the class without books and my nephew was totally depressed with these situation and got demoralized. We have xeroxed all the books by spending nearly 4k. Unfortunately my nephew was met with an accident and his leg got welted and unable to climb 4 floors at your college and requested for an assistance to climb the step even for this management has not helps him and in the next day he was unable to walk and we informed principal on this situation and he was on leave for 1 and half week and when he been to college, management has sent him home due to log leave and not informing to DEAN which we do not know about this. We parents went to college and spoke to them and showed all the doctor proscriptions but still they have not permitted and asked us meet the dean of the college. We went to meet the dean pertaining to this issue nextday. Principal is too rude and impolite to us and he stopped us to meet the dean and told us to keep stay back our nephew in home and told him to learn from home by him self with out attending college and now they have provided the books to him and told to attend the final exams by paying full fee and these things has forcefully took a written letter from us by pretending us to take the TC.', 
Principal has demotivating and demoralizing the my nephew and cornering him in front of all the students and also the principal was showing the andhra and telangana discrimination towards the students and where my nephew was totally depressed and disturbed and also he is loosing concentration on studies.
