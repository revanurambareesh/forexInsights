The appreciation of my work in the form of The Women Excellence Award fills me with immense pride and is proof that great work always gets noticed.The award is also a reflection of Essar\u2019s commitment to gender parity. I take this opportunity to thank the management at Essar, my HOD and team HBI for their extraordinary support at all times.', Anjali Kumari, Essar Steel India Ltd. ', The past 20 years with ESSAR has been a great experience with an opportunity to work in O & M, Project Planning, Energy Management and Maintenance Planning fields of power plant. The experience so gained, enabled me to become a certified Energy Auditor& Manager with distinction. It also helped me in winning a scholarship from BEE (Bureau of Energy Efficiency,Govt of India) to be trained in JICA,Japan in the field of Energy efficiency. ESSAR provides a very conducive environment for working women to excel in their career. ', Salimma Jose, Essar Power Ltd. ',
