', Samuel Wilderspin',  opened his first infant school in London in 1819,', [8]', u" and went on to establish hundreds more. He published many works on the subject, and his work became the model for infant schools throughout England and further afield. Play was an important part of Wilderspin's system of education. He is credited with inventing the ", playground', . In 1823, Wilderspin published ', On the Importance of Educating the Infant Poor', , based on the school. He began working for the Infant School Society the next year, informing others about his views.

', ECD programs were first introduced during the Soviet occupation with the establishment in 1980 of 27 urban preschools, or kodakistan. The number of preschools grew steadily during the 1980s, reaching a high of more than 270 by 1990, with 2,300 teachers caring for more than 21,000 children. These facilities were an urban phenomenon, mostly in Kabul, and were attached to schools, government offices, or factories. Based on the Soviet model, they provided nursery care, preschool, and kindergarten for children from 3 months to 6 years of age under the direction of the Department of Labor and Social Welfare.', 
', The vast majority of Afghan families were never exposed to this system, and many of these families are in opposition of the program due to the belief that it diminishes the central role of the family and inculcates children with Soviet values. With the onset of civil war after the Soviet withdrawal, the number of kindergartens dropped rapidly. By 1995, only 88 functioning facilities serving 2,110 children survived, and the Taliban restrictions on female employment eliminated all of the remaining centers in areas under their control. In 2007, there were about 260 early years centers serving over 25000 children. Though every government center is required to have an early childhood center,', [', citation needed', ]',  at present, no governmental policies deal with early childhood and no institutions have either the responsibility or the capacity to provide such services.', [', citation needed', ]',

', History', 
', In 1779, ', Johann Friedrich Oberlin',  and Louise Scheppler founded in ', Strasbourg',  an early establishment for caring for and educating pre-school children whose parents were absent during the day.', [2]',  At about the same time, in 1780, similar infant establishments were established in ', Bavaria', .', [3]',  In 1802, Princess ', Pauline zur Lippe',  established a preschool center in ', Detmold', , the capital of the then principality of Lippe, Germany (now in the State of ', North Rhine-Westphalia', ).', 
', In 1816, ', Robert Owen', , a philosopher and ', pedagogue', , opened the first British and probably globally the first infants school in ', New Lanark', , Scotland.', [4]', [5]', [6]',  In conjunction with his venture for ', cooperative',  mills Owen wanted the children to be given a good moral education so that they would be fit for work. His system was successful in producing obedient children with basic literacy and numeracy.', [7]', 
', Samuel Wilderspin',  opened his first infant school in London in 1819,', [8]', u" and went on to establish hundreds more. He published many works on the subject, and his work became the model for infant schools throughout England and further afield. Play was an important part of Wilderspin's system of education. He is credited with inventing the ", playground', . In 1823, Wilderspin published ', On the Importance of Educating the Infant Poor', , based on the school. He began working for the Infant School Society the next year, informing others about his views. He also wrote ', The Infant System, for developing the physical, intellectual, and moral powers of all children from 1 to seven years of age', .',

The idea became popular among the nobility and the middle class and was copied throughout the ', Kingdom of Hungary', .', 
', Friedrich Fröbel',  (1782\u20131852) opened a "play and activity" institute in 1837 in the village of ', Bad Blankenburg',  in the ', principality',  of ', Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt', , Thuringia, as an experimental social experience for children entering school. He renamed his institute ', Kindergarten',  on June 28, 1840, reflecting his belief that children should be nurtured and nourished "like plants in a garden".', [11]',

', ECD programs were first introduced during the Soviet occupation with the establishment in 1980 of 27 urban preschools, or kodakistan. The number of preschools grew steadily during the 1980s, reaching a high of more than 270 by 1990, with 2,300 teachers caring for more than 21,000 children. These facilities were an urban phenomenon, mostly in Kabul, and were attached to schools, government offices, or factories. Based on the Soviet model, they provided nursery care, preschool, and kindergarten for children from 3 months to 6 years of age under the direction of the Department of Labor and Social Welfare.', 
', The vast majority of Afghan families were never exposed to this system, and many of these families are in opposition of the program due to the belief that it diminishes the central role of the family and inculcates children with Soviet values. With the onset of civil war after the Soviet withdrawal, the number of kindergartens dropped rapidly. By 1995, only 88 functioning facilities serving 2,110 children survived, and the Taliban restrictions on female employment eliminated all of the remaining centers in areas under their control. In 2007, there were about 260 early years centers serving over 25000 children. Though every government center is required to have an early childhood center,', [', citation needed', ]',  at present, no governmental policies deal with early childhood and no institutions have either the responsibility or the capacity to provide such services.', [', citation needed', ]',

In Victoria and Tasmania the phrase for the first year of primary school is called ', Prep',  (short for "preparatory"), which is followed by grade 1. In Queensland, kindergarten is usually an institution for children around the age of 4 and thus it is the precursor to preschool and primary education.

', In Germany, a ', Kindergarten',  (masculine: ', der',  Kindergarten, plural ', Kindergärten', ) is a facility for the care of pre-school children who are typically at least three years old. By contrast, ', Kinderkrippe',  or ', Krippe',  refers to a crèche for the care of children before they enter ', Kindergarten',  (9 weeks to about three years), ', Kindertagesstätte', \u2014literally "children's day site", usually shortened to ', Kita', \u2014is an ', umbrella term',  for any day care facility for pre-schoolers.',

Due to the ', subsidiarity principle',  stipulated by §4 ', SGB VIII', u", there are a multitude of operators, from municipalities, churches and welfare societies to parents' initiatives and profit-based corporations. Many ", Kindergärten',  follow a certain educational approach, such as ', Montessori', , ', Reggio Emilia', , "', Berliner Bildungsprogramm', " or ', Waldorf', ; ', forest kindergartens',  are well established. Most ', Kindergärten',  are subsidised by the community councils, with the fees depending on the income of the parents.', 
', Even in smaller townships there are often both ', Roman Catholic',  and ', Lutheran', u" kindergartens available. Places in crèches and kindergarten are often difficult to secure, and must be 'reserved' in advance, although the situation has improved with a new law in effect August 2013. The availability of childcare, however, varies greatly by region. It is usually better in eastern regions, and in big cities in the north, such as Berlin", [21]',  or Hamburg,', [22]',  and poorest in parts of ', Southern Germany', .', [23]',

The goal of the teacher is to overcome weak points in each child's knowledge or skills.",
