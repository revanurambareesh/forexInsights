', Today, I would like to share with you a set of significant organizational changes in Mindtree. I believe, these changes will take us into 2020 and beyond to make us a memorable company. Effective April 1, 2016, I will step down from my role as the Executive Chairman. I will remain on the board of Mindtree as a Non-Executive Director and continue to support the leadership team.', 
', Krishna Kumar (KK) will take over from me as the Executive Chairman. In his new role, he will focus on medium & long-range, strategic issues that influence our progress to 2020 and build capacity far beyond. Rostow Ravanan will take over from KK as the Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of the company.', 
', Rostow,44, currently heads the Enterprise Service Lines and the Key Accounts Group at Mindtree. He is also responsible for leading Mindtree\u2019s business in Europe. Prior to his current position, he was Chief Financial Officer and led Mindtree\u2019s IPO in February 2007, which was amongst the most successful IPOs. He also defined and implemented processes for good governance that led Mindtree to be ranked amongst the best-governed companies in India. Prior to co-founding Mindtree, Rostow worked with Lucent Technologies where he was responsible for long-term strategic planning at Bell Laboratories\u2019 Product Realization Center in India. Before Lucent, he was at KPMG Corporate Finance and specialized in strategy consulting, mergers, and acquisitions. Rostow is an alumni of the Harvard Business School and is a member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and the Institute of Company Secretaries of India.', 
', The changes in our roles and responsibilities are the culmination of a yearlong, intense exercise in succession planning that was headed by Ms. Apurva Purohit, who is an independent director on our Board and the chairperson of the Nominations and Remuneration Committee. The Board looked at several internal and external candidates before coming to its decision.', 
', Mindtree could not have been where it is today without the goodwill of many people, among them, are my readers. Going forward, all of us at Mindtree will count on your support to build a future-ready, great institution that is best placed to help businesses and societies to flourish. I hope the seamless transition at Mindtree will also be an example to many other organizations that would one day walk the same path. Along that path will come moments of conflict when we can\u2019t let go.', 
', As leaders, our job is to make way for the future; not squat on its way. At Mindtree, the future is arriving! Welcome to Possible',
