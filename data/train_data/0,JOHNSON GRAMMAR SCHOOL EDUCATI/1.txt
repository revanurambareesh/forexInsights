', Johnson Grammar School was established by Johnson Grammar Society of S.R.N Mudiraj. The original campus, established in 1979 in Habsiguda was affiliated to ICSE, ', New Delhi', . Later, keeping in view the needs of the students aspiring to opt for the S.S.C stream of syllabus, an ambitious project of establishing SSC-Wing of Johnson Grammar School was initiated by Mr.Mudiraj. The first S.S.C branch was established in Habsiguda in 1998 and then in Nacharam in 2000.', 
', The Nacharam branch is usually considered as the main administrative branch of the school due to its larger strength and larger external participation.', [2]', 
', Campus', [', edit', ]', 
', Johnson Grammar School is located in Raghavendra Nagar of ', Nacharam', . It has a campus of 3 acres. Facilities include a ', basketball',  court, a ', football',  court and a ', volleyball',  court. In addition, it has a large lawn for pre-primary children. Formerly, it even possessed ', cricket',  courts though they are now removed. The school once used to have two blocks. One of them is now inactive and the other building was upgraded with the addition of a new floor to accompany the remaining students. Presently, there are two floors in the building with a student strength of at least 1500.', 
', Education', [', edit', ]', 
', Johnson Grammar School has classes from Class | to Class X. On an average, each class has at least four sections. Until class V, it is co-educational but from VI, there are separate sections for boys and girls(this system is now removed and now all the classes are having co-education,).
