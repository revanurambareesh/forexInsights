', INSTRUCTIONS  FOR BUS USERS', 
', 
1. Parents are requested not to enter school buses to see off and receive their wards.', 
2. Parents should not try to overtake and stop the School bus to facilitate the boarding of

their wards as this endangers the safety of the bus and its occupants. This act would lead to 

strict disciplinary action, including withdrawal of school bus facilities to the concerned 

student.', 

3. Parents should not argue with the teachers present in the bus or the conductor / driver. If

there is any problem, a written complaint to the Administrative Officer/Assistant 

Administrative Officer/ Bus In Charge should be given.', 

4. Under no circumstances students are allowed to go behind or under the parked buses 

within the school campus. Students are also not allowed to sit in the parked buses during 

school hours.', 

5. Under no circumstances, should students touch the instrument panel of the buses.', 

6. A student using the school bus is expected to be at the bus stop at leastten minutes 

before the scheduled arrival of the bus. The student has to be on the correct side of the
