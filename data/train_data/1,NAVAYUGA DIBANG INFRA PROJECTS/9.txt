', ITANAGAR, Jul 24:',  A shadow puppet show, the first of its kind in Arunachal Pradesh
    was performed at Siiro village, Ziro by a team of puppeteers from the Centre for
    Cultural Research and Documentation (CCRD) in association with the Arunachal Pradesh
    State Medicinal Plant Board under United Nations Development Program (UNDP). The
    theme of the puppet play centered around making villagers aware of the usage and
    preservation of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (MAPs) found in Ziro valley, which
    could become an alternative source of livelihood. ', 
', \u201cI have never seen so many people turn up for any awareness campaign before. It was
    very entertaining and informative too. I hope the duration of the show will be increased
    in length whenever this is performed again\u2026.it will add to its impact\u201d said HibuTatu,
    Chairman of local NGO \u201cNGUNU\u201d. ', 
', The play adapted the shadow puppetry style that is practiced in southern India, Malaysia
    and Indonesia and incorporated local elements and characters into the storyline.
    For the puppeteers it was a unique experience because none of them had ever handled
    a shadow puppet before. Kaling Bui, who led the crew, said that the hours of practicing
    and rehearsing the movements were difficult but paid off in the end. Scripted by
    Champa Devi, the play was produced and directed by the CCRD team.',

    the program were given brochures, diaries and calendars, which displayed varieties

', ITANAGAR, Jul 24: ', The Indigenous Faith and Cultural Society of Arunachal Pradesh
    (IFCSAP) in a memorandum to state Chief Secretary has appealed to the state Govt
    to look into all aspects and prepare proper data/assessment of minority community
    to stop  un-', due advantage by Bangladeshi Muslim, mis-', utilization of the fund and
    to avoid double standard policy before implementation of the special package from
    the Union Ministry of Minority Affairs.', 
', Referring to the media report and statements made by a section of leaders indicating
    that the state government would provide a special package of fund from the Union
    Ministry of Minority Affairs for comprehensive development and for people of certain
    districts who have been declared as minority in Arunachal Pradesh,  the IFCSAP said
     it appears to be non-', realistic since all indigenous tribe of the  state enjoy the
    status of tribal state and  reap the benefit from Govt as scheduled tribe.', 
', As per Section 2 (c) of the national commission for minorities Act.1992, Muslim,
    Christian, Buddhist, Sikh and Zoroastrian, whose population is less than that of
    Hindu\u2019s, are declared as Minority to protect their right specially in the field of
    religious institutions, education, culture, heritage and abuse of human rights from
    majority group. ', 
', IFCSAP, however, said that  in Arunachal Pradesh the indigenous Buddhist population
    along with other indigenous people converted to Christianity and other faith are
    enjoying the status and benefit of scheduled tribe. \u201cSo, it is beyond our comprehension
    on what basis the indigenous schedule tribes are now being converted to Minority
    and being provided facilities under the special package for minority community, the
    memorandum questioned.', 
', The Society feels that no person or community in Arunachal Pradesh should be given
    double benefit of both Schedule Tribes and Minority community. It would be tantamount
    to enticement and promotion for conversion to the faiths classified as minority community
    and it will have adverse effect on the preservation, promotion and protection of
    indigenous faith tradition and culture contradicting the Arunachal Pradesh Freedom
    of religion Act of 1978. Further more if government really determines to implement
    the package from the Ministry of Minority Affairs, steps should be initiated to issue
    Minority Certificate to that person who wants to avail such benefit only after making
    them surrender their ST certificate, the memorandum added.',

    any significant development in Mebo area during his four years tenure. According

', With humble respect, we would like to inform you that we the contractual staff nurse
    under NRHM has completed four years of service. As per our knowledge and human resource
    expert, it is impossible to implement any programme without satisfaction of human
    resource. But now all the NRHM employees are under paid and besides the price rise
    are also making it worse for us to survive with family. The position of NRHM employees
    in Arunachal Pradesh is very pathetic, even then these employees are working with
    full dedication. The state govt. is not giving any relief to them in any manner e.g.
    regularization or increment to their salary. Presently the salary paid by different
    states is very less and not uniform. For example state govt. in Assam and Meghalaya
    are paying NRHM staffs salary for Medical officers-',  Rs.37, 680, District Programme
    Manager-',  Rs.36, 400, Staffs nurse-',  Rs.17, 415, Lab. Technician-',  Rs.12, 900, Estt.
    Clerk / LDC-',  Rs.12, 920, and Account clerk-',  Rs.12, 920. Hence, we request the Hon\u2019ble
    Minister Health and Family to regularize all NRHM staffs with suitable salary according
    to the nature of work and posting place for effective implementation of the programme.
    We hope our state govt. will do the needful as early as possible.',

', Dear Editor,', 
', Through your esteemed daily I would like to express my gratitude towards the new
    team of East Kameng Social Welfare And Cultural Organisation (Ekswco). Since EKSWCO
    is the oldest organization of East Kameng District and great personalities of East
    Kameng district like Late Dera Natung, former minister and pioneer of the Modern
    Arunachal, Rachob Taba, Registrar Rajiv Gandhi University and Late Nisham Sonam first
    APCS from East Kameng were all once the Executive member of EKSWCO in their time.
    And the height of dignity of the organisation has reached upto this level that every
    citizens of the district expects EKSWCO to play the role of watch dog in every developmental
    activity and social issues of the district. Being the youth and future of the district
    we also expect some inspirational and milestone work from the EKSWCO. But EKSWCO
    seemed to be at deep sleep and was only making headlines for land encroachment of
    government quarters at the GOSSIPING TIMES OF SEPPA for almost a decade. But the
    new team of EKSWCO under dynamic leadership of Dr. Tachi Taku, Chairman and Er. Pai
    Dawe, AGS are giving us some rays of hope. This new team since taking over their
    responsibilities are taking up many social issues and developmental activities for
    the welfare of the people of East Kameng in very short period like (1) Requested
    Arunachal Trans-', Highway department to first complete Seppa to Sagalee road in place
    of Nechipu to Seppa road so that it can be used as alternative. (2)Initiated and
    succeed for solving famous Panchayat Election related problems of Sawa Zilla Parishad
    block with the help of Nyishi Elite Society. (3)Initiating to ban all kinds of student
    politics at every schools of East Kameng District. (4) Conducted mass social service
    at Seppa to Bana road as a mark of respect to our beloved pioneer Late Dera Natung
    on his birth day anniversary.(5)Taking up the problems of shortage of teachers in
    every schools of East Kameng District with the State government. So I on behalf of
    all the members of Kra-', Dadii Club give my heartiest thanks and express highest regard

', It is a matter of serious concern for many of the aspirants for upcoming Assistant
    Engineer (Civil) examination to be conducted by APPSC on 10th and 11th August that
    the call letters have been issued without photo identity which is shocking. This
    has created an apprehension and some kind of fixing can\u2019t be ruled out. There is
    a chance of hired fake candidate attending the written examination in place of actual
    candidates. A necessary rectification has to be done by issuing fresh call letters
    with proper photo identity in order to avoid future complicacies that may like to
    arise. We further hope that the Highest Recruiting Body of the state will conduct

', Poverty declines ', 
', u"Odisha and Bihar have once again topped India's poverty list-", this time for all the
    right reasons. The percentage of abjectly poor people in these two states has declined
    faster than in any other between 2004-', 05 and 2011-', 12. Despite this, however, in a
    measure of how poorly off they were earlier, the proportion of the poor in these
    states remains well above the national average.', 
', In Odisha, the proportion of people below the poverty line (BPL) fell by 24.6 per
    cent, from 57.2 per cent in 2004-', 05 to 32.6 per cent in 2011-', 12. In Bihar, which
    logged the fastest growth rate during the 11th five-', year plan (2007-', 12), poverty
    fell by an estimated 20.7 per cent to 33.7 per cent in 2011-', 12, compared to 54.4
    per cent in 2004-', 05. The national BPL average is 21.9 per cent, translating into
    nearly 270 million people.', 
', The government has set the bar low, defining anyone earning Rs 27.20 or less in rural
    areas as BPL, while those earning up to Rs 33.30 a day in urban areas are classified
    as poor, though these benchmarks vary from state to state. Despite improvements,
    the Bimaru states still remain home to the maximum number of poor people. Nearly
    60 million people in Uttar Pradesh or just under 30% of its population are abjectly
    poor while with 36 million and 23 million Bihar and MP are not all that far behind.', 
', Among the Bimaru states, only Rajasthan has managed to do better than the national
    average with the share of BPL in its population estimated at 14.7% in 2011-', 12, compared
    to 34.4% in 2004-', 05. In fact, the state has outperformed even Gujarat. Often cited
    as a model of good governance, rapid growth and robust infrastructure, the Modi citadel
    has 16.6% people living below the poverty line.', 
', Poverty declined by 17 in rural areas as compared to 12 per cent in urban areas.
    On an all-', India basis, there were 217 million poor in rural areas and 53 million
    in urban areas in 2011-', 12, as against 326 million and 81 million, respectively, in
    2004-', 05.',

    State Medicinal Plant Board under United Nations Development Program (UNDP). The

    could become an alternative source of livelihood. ', 
', \u201cI have never seen so many people turn up for any awareness campaign before. It was

    districts who have been declared as minority in Arunachal Pradesh,  the IFCSAP said
     it appears to be non-', realistic since all indigenous tribe of the  state enjoy the
    status of tribal state and  reap the benefit from Govt as scheduled tribe.', 
', As per Section 2 (c) of the national commission for minorities Act.1992, Muslim,
    Christian, Buddhist, Sikh and Zoroastrian, whose population is less than that of
    Hindu\u2019s, are declared as Minority to protect their right specially in the field of
    religious institutions, education, culture, heritage and abuse of human rights from
    majority group. ', 
', IFCSAP, however, said that  in Arunachal Pradesh the indigenous Buddhist population
    along with other indigenous people converted to Christianity and other faith are
    enjoying the status and benefit of scheduled tribe. \u201cSo, it is beyond our comprehension
    on what basis the indigenous schedule tribes are now being converted to Minority
    and being provided facilities under the special package for minority community, the
    memorandum questioned.', 
', The Society feels that no person or community in Arunachal Pradesh should be given
    double benefit of both Schedule Tribes and Minority community. It would be tantamount
    to enticement and promotion for conversion to the faiths classified as minority community
    and it will have adverse effect on the preservation, promotion and protection of
    indigenous faith tradition and culture contradicting the Arunachal Pradesh Freedom
    of religion Act of 1978. Further more if government really determines to implement
    the package from the Ministry of Minority Affairs, steps should be initiated to issue
    Minority Certificate to that person who wants to avail such benefit only after making
    them surrender their ST certificate, the memorandum added.',

', Poverty declines ', 
', u"Odisha and Bihar have once again topped India's poverty list-", this time for all the
    right reasons. The percentage of abjectly poor people in these two states has declined
    faster than in any other between 2004-', 05 and 2011-', 12. Despite this, however, in a
    measure of how poorly off they were earlier, the proportion of the poor in these
    states remains well above the national average.', 
', In Odisha, the proportion of people below the poverty line (BPL) fell by 24.6 per
    cent, from 57.2 per cent in 2004-', 05 to 32.6 per cent in 2011-', 12. In Bihar, which
    logged the fastest growth rate during the 11th five-', year plan (2007-', 12), poverty
    fell by an estimated 20.7 per cent to 33.7 per cent in 2011-', 12, compared to 54.4
    per cent in 2004-', 05. The national BPL average is 21.9 per cent, translating into
    nearly 270 million people.', 
', The government has set the bar low, defining anyone earning Rs 27.20 or less in rural
    areas as BPL, while those earning up to Rs 33.30 a day in urban areas are classified
    as poor, though these benchmarks vary from state to state. Despite improvements,
    the Bimaru states still remain home to the maximum number of poor people. Nearly
    60 million people in Uttar Pradesh or just under 30% of its population are abjectly
    poor while with 36 million and 23 million Bihar and MP are not all that far behind.', 
', Among the Bimaru states, only Rajasthan has managed to do better than the national
    average with the share of BPL in its population estimated at 14.7% in 2011-', 12, compared
    to 34.4% in 2004-', 05. In fact, the state has outperformed even Gujarat. Often cited
    as a model of good governance, rapid growth and robust infrastructure, the Modi citadel
    has 16.6% people living below the poverty line.', 
', Poverty declined by 17 in rural areas as compared to 12 per cent in urban areas.
    On an all-', India basis, there were 217 million poor in rural areas and 53 million
    in urban areas in 2011-', 12, as against 326 million and 81 million, respectively, in
