', Dear South-Sound Owners and Community,', 

', Effective July 18, 2016, the Central Co-op 6th Avenue site in Tacoma is closed for business and a search for a new location in the Tacoma area has been initiated. Our Board of Trustees made this decision after months of lease negotiations failed to produce a mutually agreeable set of terms between the landlord and the Cooperative. The closure of the 6th Avenue location is a sad and unexpected turn of events. After years of operating at t', his location, we were confident that all parties could come to an agreement that would benefit our business, our membership, and the property owner. We continued negotiations until we realized that a solution was beyond our reach and made the decision to close in order to give ourselves time to exit in a responsible manner. Our team is actively evaluating other sites in the Tacoma area with plans to re-open.',

', As noted in prior communications, our cooperative recently faced a difficult challenge when lease negotiations failed to produce mutually agreeable terms for our 6th Avenue location and our Board and management team made the painful decision to shut down operation at that site. We are actively working to secure a new store site in Tacoma. This is a very high priority for our top leadership team. Several potential sites are being reviewed. It is important to find a site that is accessible to the membership and that has the characteristics we know are associated with successful cooperative stores. Any new store will be an investment and the assets held by our members must be prudently deployed. That said, we all agree that a new site is an urgent matter and moving as quickly as we can while maintaining appropriate diligence is paramount. While short term pressure and sentiments can be powerful persuaders, we must tend to the long term financial and associational health of the cooperative. A new, improved site and location in Tacoma will serve members and contribute to the strength and vitality of the whole organization.',

', We are grateful for the participation of the members who attended the Community Conversation at the STAR Center in Tacoma. The passion in the room was so encouraging \u2013 we will need it as we come together to find and fund a new store as quickly as possible.', 

', We are still processing the extensive feedback we received, but a few themes are resonating:', 

', 1. Communication: We clearly did not sufficiently inform and involve the Tacoma membership of the developments surrounding the closure of the 6th Avenue store. I take personal responsibility for my failure in this regard and I will make sure this problem is overcome, with your help.', 

', 2. Trust: We need to build trust as two cooperative cultures that have come together in a challenging time to do something great. We are now a 15,000 member co-op working in two Puget Sound communities. This will require us to learn new ways of organizing, communicating and working together despite the 35 mile range of our activities. Trust is also proactive \u2013 we need to support each other and resist the efforts of those who would divide us.', 

', 3. Involvement: We have work to do. We need to build mechanisms for members to contribute meaningfully to the forward progress of this co-op in Tacoma. To that end, we will be inviting interested members to a discussion that will inform how we structure the work of the Tacoma linkage committee and how members can support the growth of the co-op. This session will be held in Tacoma on August 30th.', 

', Thanks again for the amazing work you have done to build this co-op in Tacoma and thanks for your dedication to building it even better in the future.',

', July 28, 2016: ', Letter from Jeff Bessmer, former 6th Ave Store Manager', 

', Dear Co-op Members,', 

', Last week, Central Co-op on 6', th',  Avenue was forced to close after every co-op manager\u2019s worst nightmare: non-negotiable lease terms (beyond the co-op\u2019s best interests to agree to) arriving at the 11', th',  hour. The closure of our 6', th',  Avenue site is very difficult for us \u2013 our members, our employees, our co-op.  We are temporarily without a store to call our own in Tacoma, our great local vendors have a gap in working with a strong partner, and all of the staff at the 6', th',  Ave location (including myself) have been laid off.', 

', Speaking as the 6', th',  Avenue Store Manager, I  know that without the merger with Central Co-op earlier this year, the Tacoma Food Co-op would have been in the same position, unable to meet the landlord\u2019s terms and having to close. ', The difference is that the Tacoma Food Co-op would not have had the reserves and staffing to reopen at all.  ', 

', The co-op on 6', th',  Ave was a magical place that was built by the community between 2006 and now.  We had great produce, delicious local goodies, strong community bonds between members and staff, an awesome team, and the authentic \u201cco-op smell\u201d you\u2019ll encounter in any great co-op around the world. The merger with Central brought new opportunities to have the co-op that the community envisioned and worked toward since the beginning: the full product selection and all the amenities we need to be the hub for Tacoma\u2019s local, natural foods, and co-op movements that we didn\u2019t have the resources to achieve as Tacoma Food Co-op. Despite the closure of our 6', th',  Ave site, the benefits of the merger remain intact.', 

',                  Now that we are a combined co-op we are stronger and have greater capacity, which means the co-op will be finding the best site for the Tacoma community.  How can I be so sure?', 

', 
	', Central Co-op started the search months ago, commissioning two market studies and hiring two local real estate professionals to identify the best site.',   Given what we know about the market, and the non-negotiable lease-terms, it is clear that this site was not in the cooperative\u2019s interest.', 
	', Central Co-op refunded over $200,000 in member loans', , a demonstrated investment in the Tacoma community.', 
	', Tacoma members sit on the Central Co-op Board,',  which makes all major decisions of the co-op.', 
	', Central Co-op has begun the dialogue with members and staff',  in the Tacoma area about what we want in a new store.', 
', 

', Unfortunately, the co-op wasn\u2019t able to find a new site prior to having to close operations on 6', th',  Ave.  Finding the right space and setting-up take time, and this gap between the 6', th',  Ave store and new store is the most painful part for all of us.  However, I am certain that the location we choose will be among the finest co-op stores the region has ever seen. ', 

', Today is a hard day, but now the co-op will be free to be what the Tacoma community wants and deserves. I hope the community will join me in engaging with Central Co-op on what you want to see in our next store here. We all share the same dream: a co-op that is not just a grocery store, but a hub for the local and natural foods movement, inspiring local food and cooperative innovation throughout the city.',

', July 26, 2016: A note from the former Board President of Tacoma Food Co-op', 

', July 26, 2016', 

', Dear Co-op Members,', 

',                 I have been an active member of the Tacoma Food Coop from almost the very beginning.  I have served on the Board of the Tacoma Food Coop from the summer of 2010 (Pre-opening) through December of 2015 when the merger with Central coop was complete and had the distinct honor to be Board President during those last two years. This service has provided me with a unique perspective on what it takes to create and grow a successful Co-op.', 

',                 We were all shocked and troubled by the sudden closure of the 6', th',  Ave location last week. I unfortunately was not completely surprised by it. The hard truth about our beloved storefront is that it was insufficient to the task of creating the type of Co-op we all wanted. One that was successful, had real impact in the community, and treated its staff, suppliers, and owners with dignity and respect. ', 

', How long have we known that this was the case? Longer than most of the membership knows.  Our struggles with our size and the physical limitations of the 6', th',  Avenue location were apparent to those of us even before the coop opened its doors. Most of the successful coops in the region had larger footprints than what we were dealing with. There were some examples of small stores that were doing ok financially but not really any examples of small footprint stores doing great.  We felt at the time that we could make that footprint work, but we knew it was small and the support spaces were very constrained.', 

',                 So why did we open up at that location knowing that it might be an uphill struggle to truly become successful? Several reasons. First it\u2019s what the membership wanted. Time and time again we asked, and time and time again we were told that our membership wanted a brick and mortar storefront, a place to call home. Second we were on the clock. From the time a group begins a Coop to the time that effort succeeds or fizzles out is about five years. Amber Englund had begun the earliest efforts in 2006 and our efforts to open the storefront were occurring in 2011. And finally because there was an opportunity as presented to us by John Loesch to convert his conventional space into a coop thereby reducing our startup costs by more than half.  With that opportunity on the table and the very real momentum that we felt within our membership we took a chance on Tacoma, we took a chance on the Coop.', 

',                 But weren\u2019t we successful during the four and a half years that we operated as Tacoma Food Coop?  Unfortunately we weren\u2019t. And this was due to several factors.  First we were not able to raise as much capital as we wanted to when we opened and that limited the improvements we could afford to make in the store. Second our projections for growth were overly optimistic. We had hoped to achieve double digit growth every year for the first few years because that was the kind of growth that coops had always achieved in the past.  But by chance we opened up the Coop at a time when the industry was changing. Coops were no longer seeing that level of growth as our conventional competitors began to compete directly with us. And last we made some mistakes and poor decisions in some of the investments we made. We overbought, we underbought, we bought the wrong product, we made all sorts of mistakes that could reasonably be expected of a startup to make. And as a result we saw losses.  Some small, some large, but consistently we lost money.                 ', 

', Ever the optimist I kept believing that there was going to be some combination of staff, resources and outside influences which would eventually propel us past the limitations we faced. Assuming of course that we survived long enough for that to happen.  And it did happen.  We were offered an opportunity to merge our coop community with the Central Coop\u2019s community in Seattle.  It was on balance a god send.  It allowed us to immediately become the Coop we wanted to be.  Better wages, lower prices, and wider impact. ', 

', Which brings us back to the current impasse. How come the lease negotiations failed? They failed because the two sides could not come to mutually agreeable terms. Now that may seem a trite response, but it makes it no less true.  And it in essence comes down to a differing opinion, a differing vision on what it takes to run a business. John\u2019s business model and his perspective on what is important to succeed has always been at odds with our own vision and business perspective. John ran a successful conventional corner grocery for years before the first time he tried to retire. At some point he decided he would be more successful if he split his property into two business.  Since that time no business has successfully operated on that property. Not his own grocery, not the restaurant, not the bar, and not the Coop. We began our renegotiations with John in August of last year signaling our intention to renew the lease and expressing an interest in acquiring the space that was occupied by the bar. This was before merger talks and though we weren\u2019t sure at that time we could afford to take over the rear of the store we wanted to pursue that option. ', 

', Then the merger talks and the successful effort to complete the merger. Almost immediately we began to see benefits of that decision. Better wages and lower prices and the very real hope of taking the Coop to the next level.  And it was at this time that my service to the coop ended.  I do not have any additional knowledge about what was and was not in the terms which were rejected by the Coop Board this month.  But I have a true working knowledge of the factors that the Central Board would be considering as they made their decisions.  How much investment would it take to reconnect the front half of the store with the rear? How much would that investment grow the sales floor of the coop?  Would that investment allow for a Deli, a hot bar, a prep kitchen or any other number of options? What level of sales growth would that investment stimulate and would that growth be sufficient to provide a return on that investment?  These and many more considerations would have gone into the decision, but the one consideration that would have been more important than any other would have been.  Is this deal in the best interest of the community we are trying to serve?  And not just the short term interests, but long term does this deal make sense. If it didn\u2019t then the board had a responsibility to make the tough call.  It may not make sense to say that the closing of a storefront, the laying off of our simply awesome staff of our Tacoma store is in the best interests of the Tacoma community, but the truth is it most certainly was. I know the all the players involved.  I know the integrity of the Board of Trustees, I know about their commitment to this community, and I know about their abilities to govern effectively.  These are among the most dedicated and caring individuals that I have ever met.  They are also among the most capable. They are a nationally recognized force for good in the cooperative movement and they would not have, could not have made the decision that they did if it was not absolutely without reservation the right decisions for the coop.  And they made that decision knowing that they would face a community that would be devastated by the loss.  They made it anyway. ', 

', And they are not done. The Coop in Tacoma is a growing concern.  We will be back, bigger, better, and stronger than ever.  I would ask all the members in the Tacoma community to join me in supporting our Board over the next few months.  We are stronger together, believe it.',

', July 21, 2016: A note from Co-op Trustee Jennie Agard', 

', Dear Owners,', 

', I know many of you are shocked and dismayed at the sudden closing of the 6th Avenue Co-op. So am I! Abruptly, last week, lease negotiations with the landlord ended when we were presented with an ultimatum and we could not, as your Trustees, agree to lease terms that would be detrimental to our success in the long run. It was a terribly difficult decision to make. We all love our co-op. It\u2019s a part of who we are.', 

', 
', We\u2019ve already begun the search process for a new location in the Tacoma area. As a Tacoma resident and a co-op member-owner, I am excited about the opportunities that a new store will bring to our area.', 

', The words \u201cTacoma area\u201d mean that we are open to whatever location meets our needs. Please don\u2019t be put off by them. Tacoma comprises many neighborhoods, and while many former TFC members live in the 6th Ave. neighborhood, many others live in other neighborhoods. I live on McKinley Hill. I used to make the 6-mile drive to the co-op once a week. My alternative is Fred Meyer, two miles away, but, well, you know: not the co-op! I, for one will be shopping at the co-op again the day it opens, whatever neighborhood it\u2019s in.', 

', A co-op is as strong as the people who participate in it. Your input is critical to the success of the future Tacoma store. In the long run what do we all want? A co-op first and foremost. A bigger co-op? Classes? A deli? A meat department? Fresh fish? More interaction with our community? What facilities will we need to do all that? Where? One location or more? We\u2019ll be asking for your ideas and creativity as we search for a new location. Stay tuned.', 

', Please understand that we, your trustees, are doing our utmost to make the best decisions for our Co-op\u2019s membership: not hurried or costly decisions, the right decisions.',

', We are still processing the extensive feedback we received, but a few themes are resonating:', 

', 1. Communication: We clearly did not sufficiently inform and involve the Tacoma membership of the developments surrounding the closure of the 6th Avenue store. I take personal responsibility for my failure in this regard and I will make sure this problem is overcome, with your help.', 

', 2. Trust: We need to build trust as two cooperative cultures that have come together in a challenging time to do something great. We are now a 15,000 member co-op working in two Puget Sound communities. This will require us to learn new ways of organizing, communicating and working together despite the 35 mile range of our activities. Trust is also proactive \u2013 we need to support each other and resist the efforts of those who would divide us.', 

', 3. Involvement: We have work to do. We need to build mechanisms for members to contribute meaningfully to the forward progress of this co-op in Tacoma. To that end, we will be inviting interested members to a discussion that will inform how we structure the work of the Tacoma linkage committee and how members can support the growth of the co-op. This session will be held in Tacoma on August 30th.', 

', Thanks again for the amazing work you have done to build this co-op in Tacoma and thanks for your dedication to building it even better in the future.', 

', More soon,',

', July 28, 2016: ', Letter from Jeff Bessmer, former 6th Ave Store Manager', 

', Dear Co-op Members,', 

', Last week, Central Co-op on 6', th',  Avenue was forced to close after every co-op manager\u2019s worst nightmare: non-negotiable lease terms (beyond the co-op\u2019s best interests to agree to) arriving at the 11', th',  hour. The closure of our 6', th',  Avenue site is very difficult for us \u2013 our members, our employees, our co-op.  We are temporarily without a store to call our own in Tacoma, our great local vendors have a gap in working with a strong partner, and all of the staff at the 6', th',  Ave location (including myself) have been laid off.', 

', Speaking as the 6', th',  Avenue Store Manager, I  know that without the merger with Central Co-op earlier this year, the Tacoma Food Co-op would have been in the same position, unable to meet the landlord\u2019s terms and having to close. ', The difference is that the Tacoma Food Co-op would not have had the reserves and staffing to reopen at all.  ', 

', The co-op on 6', th',  Ave was a magical place that was built by the community between 2006 and now.  We had great produce, delicious local goodies, strong community bonds between members and staff, an awesome team, and the authentic \u201cco-op smell\u201d you\u2019ll encounter in any great co-op around the world. The merger with Central brought new opportunities to have the co-op that the community envisioned and worked toward since the beginning: the full product selection and all the amenities we need to be the hub for Tacoma\u2019s local, natural foods, and co-op movements that we didn\u2019t have the resources to achieve as Tacoma Food Co-op. Despite the closure of our 6', th',  Ave site, the benefits of the merger remain intact.', 

',                  Now that we are a combined co-op we are stronger and have greater capacity, which means the co-op will be finding the best site for the Tacoma community.  How can I be so sure?', 

', 
	', Central Co-op started the search months ago, commissioning two market studies and hiring two local real estate professionals to identify the best site.',   Given what we know about the market, and the non-negotiable lease-terms, it is clear that this site was not in the cooperative\u2019s interest.', 
	', Central Co-op refunded over $200,000 in member loans', , a demonstrated investment in the Tacoma community.', 
	', Tacoma members sit on the Central Co-op Board,',  which makes all major decisions of the co-op.', 
	', Central Co-op has begun the dialogue with members and staff',  in the Tacoma area about what we want in a new store.', 
', 

', Unfortunately, the co-op wasn\u2019t able to find a new site prior to having to close operations on 6', th',  Ave.  Finding the right space and setting-up take time, and this gap between the 6', th',  Ave store and new store is the most painful part for all of us.  However, I am certain that the location we choose will be among the finest co-op stores the region has ever seen. ', 

', Today is a hard day, but now the co-op will be free to be what the Tacoma community wants and deserves. I hope the community will join me in engaging with Central Co-op on what you want to see in our next store here. We all share the same dream: a co-op that is not just a grocery store, but a hub for the local and natural foods movement, inspiring local food and cooperative innovation throughout the city.',

', July 26, 2016: A note from the former Board President of Tacoma Food Co-op', 

', July 26, 2016', 

', Dear Co-op Members,', 

',                 I have been an active member of the Tacoma Food Coop from almost the very beginning.  I have served on the Board of the Tacoma Food Coop from the summer of 2010 (Pre-opening) through December of 2015 when the merger with Central coop was complete and had the distinct honor to be Board President during those last two years. This service has provided me with a unique perspective on what it takes to create and grow a successful Co-op.', 

',                 We were all shocked and troubled by the sudden closure of the 6', th',  Ave location last week. I unfortunately was not completely surprised by it. The hard truth about our beloved storefront is that it was insufficient to the task of creating the type of Co-op we all wanted. One that was successful, had real impact in the community, and treated its staff, suppliers, and owners with dignity and respect. ', 

', How long have we known that this was the case? Longer than most of the membership knows.  Our struggles with our size and the physical limitations of the 6', th',  Avenue location were apparent to those of us even before the coop opened its doors. Most of the successful coops in the region had larger footprints than what we were dealing with. There were some examples of small stores that were doing ok financially but not really any examples of small footprint stores doing great.  We felt at the time that we could make that footprint work, but we knew it was small and the support spaces were very constrained.', 

',                 So why did we open up at that location knowing that it might be an uphill struggle to truly become successful? Several reasons. First it\u2019s what the membership wanted. Time and time again we asked, and time and time again we were told that our membership wanted a brick and mortar storefront, a place to call home. Second we were on the clock. From the time a group begins a Coop to the time that effort succeeds or fizzles out is about five years. Amber Englund had begun the earliest efforts in 2006 and our efforts to open the storefront were occurring in 2011. And finally because there was an opportunity as presented to us by John Loesch to convert his conventional space into a coop thereby reducing our startup costs by more than half.  With that opportunity on the table and the very real momentum that we felt within our membership we took a chance on Tacoma, we took a chance on the Coop.', 

',                 But weren\u2019t we successful during the four and a half years that we operated as Tacoma Food Coop?  Unfortunately we weren\u2019t. And this was due to several factors.  First we were not able to raise as much capital as we wanted to when we opened and that limited the improvements we could afford to make in the store. Second our projections for growth were overly optimistic. We had hoped to achieve double digit growth every year for the first few years because that was the kind of growth that coops had always achieved in the past.  But by chance we opened up the Coop at a time when the industry was changing. Coops were no longer seeing that level of growth as our conventional competitors began to compete directly with us. And last we made some mistakes and poor decisions in some of the investments we made. We overbought, we underbought, we bought the wrong product, we made all sorts of mistakes that could reasonably be expected of a startup to make. And as a result we saw losses.  Some small, some large, but consistently we lost money.                 ', 

', Ever the optimist I kept believing that there was going to be some combination of staff, resources and outside influences which would eventually propel us past the limitations we faced. Assuming of course that we survived long enough for that to happen.  And it did happen.  We were offered an opportunity to merge our coop community with the Central Coop\u2019s community in Seattle.  It was on balance a god send.  It allowed us to immediately become the Coop we wanted to be.  Better wages, lower prices, and wider impact. ', 

', Which brings us back to the current impasse. How come the lease negotiations failed? They failed because the two sides could not come to mutually agreeable terms. Now that may seem a trite response, but it makes it no less true.  And it in essence comes down to a differing opinion, a differing vision on what it takes to run a business. John\u2019s business model and his perspective on what is important to succeed has always been at odds with our own vision and business perspective. John ran a successful conventional corner grocery for years before the first time he tried to retire. At some point he decided he would be more successful if he split his property into two business.  Since that time no business has successfully operated on that property. Not his own grocery, not the restaurant, not the bar, and not the Coop. We began our renegotiations with John in August of last year signaling our intention to renew the lease and expressing an interest in acquiring the space that was occupied by the bar. This was before merger talks and though we weren\u2019t sure at that time we could afford to take over the rear of the store we wanted to pursue that option. ', 

', Then the merger talks and the successful effort to complete the merger. Almost immediately we began to see benefits of that decision. Better wages and lower prices and the very real hope of taking the Coop to the next level.  And it was at this time that my service to the coop ended.  I do not have any additional knowledge about what was and was not in the terms which were rejected by the Coop Board this month.  But I have a true working knowledge of the factors that the Central Board would be considering as they made their decisions.  How much investment would it take to reconnect the front half of the store with the rear? How much would that investment grow the sales floor of the coop?  Would that investment allow for a Deli, a hot bar, a prep kitchen or any other number of options? What level of sales growth would that investment stimulate and would that growth be sufficient to provide a return on that investment?  These and many more considerations would have gone into the decision, but the one consideration that would have been more important than any other would have been.  Is this deal in the best interest of the community we are trying to serve?  And not just the short term interests, but long term does this deal make sense. If it didn\u2019t then the board had a responsibility to make the tough call.  It may not make sense to say that the closing of a storefront, the laying off of our simply awesome staff of our Tacoma store is in the best interests of the Tacoma community, but the truth is it most certainly was. I know the all the players involved.  I know the integrity of the Board of Trustees, I know about their commitment to this community, and I know about their abilities to govern effectively.  These are among the most dedicated and caring individuals that I have ever met.  They are also among the most capable. They are a nationally recognized force for good in the cooperative movement and they would not have, could not have made the decision that they did if it was not absolutely without reservation the right decisions for the coop.  And they made that decision knowing that they would face a community that would be devastated by the loss.  They made it anyway. ', 

', And they are not done. The Coop in Tacoma is a growing concern.  We will be back, bigger, better, and stronger than ever.  I would ask all the members in the Tacoma community to join me in supporting our Board over the next few months.  We are stronger together, believe it.',

', July 21, 2016: A note from Co-op Trustee Jennie Agard', 

', Dear Owners,', 

', I know many of you are shocked and dismayed at the sudden closing of the 6th Avenue Co-op. So am I! Abruptly, last week, lease negotiations with the landlord ended when we were presented with an ultimatum and we could not, as your Trustees, agree to lease terms that would be detrimental to our success in the long run. It was a terribly difficult decision to make. We all love our co-op. It\u2019s a part of who we are.', 

', 
', We\u2019ve already begun the search process for a new location in the Tacoma area. As a Tacoma resident and a co-op member-owner, I am excited about the opportunities that a new store will bring to our area.', 

', The words \u201cTacoma area\u201d mean that we are open to whatever location meets our needs. Please don\u2019t be put off by them. Tacoma comprises many neighborhoods, and while many former TFC members live in the 6th Ave. neighborhood, many others live in other neighborhoods. I live on McKinley Hill. I used to make the 6-mile drive to the co-op once a week. My alternative is Fred Meyer, two miles away, but, well, you know: not the co-op! I, for one will be shopping at the co-op again the day it opens, whatever neighborhood it\u2019s in.', 

', A co-op is as strong as the people who participate in it. Your input is critical to the success of the future Tacoma store. In the long run what do we all want? A co-op first and foremost. A bigger co-op? Classes? A deli? A meat department? Fresh fish? More interaction with our community? What facilities will we need to do all that? Where? One location or more? We\u2019ll be asking for your ideas and creativity as we search for a new location. Stay tuned.', 

', Please understand that we, your trustees, are doing our utmost to make the best decisions for our Co-op\u2019s membership: not hurried or costly decisions, the right decisions.',
