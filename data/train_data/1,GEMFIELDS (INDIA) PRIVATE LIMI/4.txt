Faberg\u0026eacute; was acquired by Gemfields on 28 January 2013.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eGemfields\u0026rsquo; acquisition of Faberg\u0026eacute; aligned the world\u0026rsquo;s largest coloured gemstone producer with one of the most iconic heritage brands. The acquisition enables Gemfields to take its vision for coloured gemstones to the next level, harnessing the Faberg\u0026eacute; name to boost the international presence and perception of coloured gemstones and advancing the \u0026ldquo;mine and market\u0026rdquo; vision.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe coming together of Gemfields and Faberg\u0026eacute; serves as an exclamation mark at the end of the \u0026ldquo;mine and market\u0026rdquo; mantra. Faberg\u0026eacute; is a coloured gemstone champion, a name to conjure with at the top end of the luxury goods market, offering the finest jewellery that money can buy, and made from the finest gemstones.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eFaberg\u0026eacute; allows Gemfields to operate in the two most profitable segments within the gemstone supply chain, creating a platform to further increase the Company\u0026rsquo;s market share within the coloured gemstone sector, and providing greater influence over the positioning and consumer awareness of coloured gemstones.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eFaberg\u0026eacute; brings considerable direct and indirect value to the business as demand and confidence continues to rise.

Steeped in Imperial Russian history, aristocratic mystery and intrigue, Faberg\u0026eacute;\u0026rsquo;s story is one of inextricable significance \u0026ndash; sympathetically told in the feature film Faberg\u0026eacute;: A Life of Its Own, released in June 2015.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eFew names in the history of jewellery-making have about them such an aura of romance and genius as that of Faberg\u0026eacute;. The house was established in 1842 in St Petersburg by Gustav Faberg\u0026eacute;; but it was his son, Peter Carl Faberg\u0026eacute;, who would turn the family firm into a byword for luxury, most famously through the 50 bejewelled eggs that he made for the Russian royal family between 1885 and 1916 and that are universally lauded as unrivalled masterpieces.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eBorn in 1846 and apprenticed as a boy to his goldsmith father Gustav, Peter Carl Faberg\u0026eacute; was educated in St Petersburg and Dresden, influenced greatly and at an early age by the famed Renaissance and Baroque treasures of Dresden\u0026rsquo;s Green Vaults.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eAppointed as official goldsmith to the Russian Imperial Court, Faberg\u0026eacute;\u0026rsquo;s prodigious body of work and its veneration today are the heart of Peter Carl\u0026rsquo;s legacy. His work leading up to 1917 encapsulates the opulent yet tragic story of the end of both the Romanov dynasty and of Faberg\u0026eacute; itself \u0026ndash; a tale which has captivated generations.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eFaberg\u0026eacute; has, since the Russian Revolution of 1917, undergone numerous incarnations of ownership and direction, before coming into the Gemfields fold in 2013.

', Fabergé', 

', Overview', 

', Fabergé is one of the world\u2019s most legendary brand names, with a well-documented and globally recognised heritage. Fabergé was acquired by Gemfields on 28 January 2013.', 

', Gemfields\u2019 acquisition of Fabergé aligned the world\u2019s largest coloured gemstone producer with one of the most iconic heritage brands. The acquisition enables Gemfields to take its vision for coloured gemstones to the next level, harnessing the Fabergé name to boost the international presence and perception of coloured gemstones and advancing the \u201cmine and market\u201d vision.', 

', The coming together of Gemfields and Fabergé serves as an exclamation mark at the end of the \u201cmine and market\u201d mantra. Fabergé is a coloured gemstone champion, a name to conjure with at the top end of the luxury goods market, offering the finest jewellery that money can buy, and made from the finest gemstones.', 

', Fabergé allows Gemfields to operate in the two most profitable segments within the gemstone supply chain, creating a platform to further increase the Company\u2019s market share within the coloured gemstone sector, and providing greater influence over the positioning and consumer awareness of coloured gemstones.', 

', Fabergé brings considerable direct and indirect value to the business as demand and confidence continues to rise. Gemfields\u2019 rough gemstone customers share the company\u2019s belief and commitment to driving industry and consumer demand by suitably positioning and promoting precious coloured gemstones. Fabergé ensures that Gemfields reaches both trade and end customers.', 

', Progress to date is clearly evidenced by both the success of Gemfields\u2019 auctions and the impactful marketing campaigns delivered through Fabergé.', 

', Following the merger, Fabergé launched its first advertising campaign under Gemfields\u2019 ownership, entitled \u2018The Art of Colour\u2019. The campaign images depicted Fabergé\u2019s \u2018Emotion\u2019 rings, showcasing pavé-set coloured gemstones and soon became a best-selling design. Each ring is unique and is set with over 300 coloured gemstones.', 

', Fabergé\u2019s design team has concentrated on creating new jewellery pieces and collections that reflect the artistic use of coloured gemstones in support of this brand strategy. This has generated strong international coverage, traversing the luxury goods, fashion, financial and trade media.',

', History', 

', Fabergé\u2019s history is integral to the brand\u2019s reverence today. Steeped in Imperial Russian history, aristocratic mystery and intrigue, Fabergé\u2019s story is one of inextricable significance \u2013 sympathetically told in the feature film Fabergé: A Life of Its Own, released in June 2015.', 

', Few names in the history of jewellery-making have about them such an aura of romance and genius as that of Fabergé. The house was established in 1842 in St Petersburg by Gustav Fabergé; but it was his son, Peter Carl Fabergé, who would turn the family firm into a byword for luxury, most famously through the 50 bejewelled eggs that he made for the Russian royal family between 1885 and 1916 and that are universally lauded as unrivalled masterpieces. ', 

', Born in 1846 and apprenticed as a boy to his goldsmith father Gustav, Peter Carl Fabergé was educated in St Petersburg and Dresden, influenced greatly and at an early age by the famed Renaissance and Baroque treasures of Dresden\u2019s Green Vaults.', 

', Appointed as official goldsmith to the Russian Imperial Court, Fabergé\u2019s prodigious body of work and its veneration today are the heart of Peter Carl\u2019s legacy. His work leading up to 1917 encapsulates the opulent yet tragic story of the end of both the Romanov dynasty and of Fabergé itself \u2013 a tale which has captivated generations.', 

', Fabergé has, since the Russian Revolution of 1917, undergone numerous incarnations of ownership and direction, before coming into the Gemfields fold in 2013. Under Gemfields\u2019 leadership, modern Fabergé collections can once again pay homage to Peter Carl Fabergé and his penchant for colour and gemstones. Fabergé continues to benefit from the expertise and guidance of Tatiana and Sarah Fabergé, his great-grand-daughters.', 

', Gemfields considers it a great privilege and responsibility to have Fabergé as a part of the Group.', 

',  ', 

', Gemfields\u2019 vision',
