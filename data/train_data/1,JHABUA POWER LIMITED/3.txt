', Background', 
', The power station is sponsored by ', Jhabua Power',  of ', Avantha Power and Infrastructure', . In July 2015 it was reported that ICICI Bank\u2019s private-equity arm and ', Tata Power',  were in advanced talks to acquire phase I (600 MW) and phase II (600 MW) of the project.', [3]', 
', Phase 1', 
', Phase 1 of the project is a 600 MW subcritical unit. This stage is in construction as of late 2011 with commissioning slated for January 2013.', [2]', [4]', 
', According to a timeline posted on the Avantha website, construction began in April 2011 and was ongoing in May 2013.', [5]', 
', In 2012 it was reported that construction of unit 1 was facing delays due to opposition from local residents "right from the beginning." The project had resistance from farmers over land acquisition, who have alleged inadequate compensation and high handedness by the plant authorities, leading to protests.', [6]', 
', According to the EIA for phase II in May 2013, Unit 1 was still under construction.', [7]', 
', According to the India Ministry of Power, unit 1 is planned for commissioning in December 2015,', [8]',  later pushed to March 2016.', [9]', 
', Unit 1 was commissioned in March 2016.', [10]', 
', Phase 2', 
', Phase 2 of the project is a 600 MW supercritical unit. The sponsor was soliciting bids for this phase in February 2012.', [2]', 
', Phase II received environmental clearance in August 2014,', [11]', [3]',  which was extended to ', Jhabua Power',  in February 2016.', [12]', 
', As of July 2016, there is no estimated date for completion of phase II, and it is not listed as under construction.', [13]', [14]',

', Background', 
', The power station is sponsored by ', Jhabua Power',  of ', Avantha Power and Infrastructure', . In July 2015 it was reported that ICICI Bank\u2019s private-equity arm and ', Tata Power',  were in advanced talks to acquire phase I (600 MW) and phase II (600 MW) of the project.', [3]', 
', Phase 1', 
', Phase 1 of the project is a 600 MW subcritical unit. This stage is in construction as of late 2011 with commissioning slated for January 2013.', [2]', [4]', 
', According to a timeline posted on the Avantha website, construction began in April 2011 and was ongoing in May 2013.', [5]', 
', In 2012 it was reported that construction of unit 1 was facing delays due to opposition from local residents "right from the beginning." The project had resistance from farmers over land acquisition, who have alleged inadequate compensation and high handedness by the plant authorities, leading to protests.', [6]', 
', According to the EIA for phase II in May 2013, Unit 1 was still under construction.', [7]', 
', According to the India Ministry of Power, unit 1 is planned for commissioning in December 2015,', [8]',  later pushed to March 2016.', [9]', 
', Unit 1 was commissioned in March 2016.', [10]', 
', Phase 2', 
', Phase 2 of the project is a 600 MW supercritical unit. The sponsor was soliciting bids for this phase in February 2012.', [2]', 
', Phase II received environmental clearance in August 2014,', [11]', [3]',  which was extended to ', Jhabua Power',  in February 2016.', [12]', 
', As of July 2016, there is no estimated date for completion of phase II, and it is not listed as under construction.', [13]', [14]',
