The delimitation process in Muzaffargarh district
was started in 2013. There were objections from political leads regarding the delimitation process
and commented that the process in not transparent. Following the delimitation process was
stopped due lack of mutual consent by the political parties. Sources revealed that the hidden
agenda behind delimitation process was \u201cpolitical objectives and interests by the current
government PML-N in order to increase \u201cvote bank\u201d. This was due to the influence by political
parties that delimitation process was stopped and now new delimitation process is in process.
Muzaffargarh district is one of the backwards district of south Punjab. Citizens and particularly
women\u2019s empowerment is low in the district due to feudalistic and male dominated trends and
traditions. There are outworn cultural practices existing in the district which restricts the
opportunities of socio-economic and political empowerment of common citizens and particularly
for the vulnerable and marginalized families including in women and young girls.

    (PITB). In Healthwatch Android-based smartphones have been provided to district supervisory officers
(EDOHs, DOHs DDOHs), who have been tasked with the collection of performance related data from Basic
Health Units, Rural Health Centers, Tehsil and District Headquarters. The data submitted by these
officers through the phones are being recorded on a website, known as the \u2018Dashboard\u2019. 7
Monitoring and Evaluation Assistants (MEAs) A key component of the Health Reform Road Map is to
strengthen monitoring and accountability through supervisory visits, setting targets and collecting
independent data. This will be accomplished through a team of MEAs. After due training MEAs will be
conducting independent visits to BHUs in all Districts of Punjab. Data collected by MEAs will help EDOs
and district managers better manage facilities in their districts. The data will also be used by the Health
Department to track progress on key initiatives and will be shared with the Chief Minister. 8

    Community groups were came into existence through local government system in 2001.Thier
prime objective was to institutionalize citizens\u2019 participation for improving governance and
accountability. Although, after the suspension of local government system now CCBs are not active
this may be due to lack of resources and funds. However, few of active and motivated activists
have made sure the sustainability of CCBs and local support organization (LSO) but their active
functionality is neither due to lack of finance resources and technical skills and capacities.
Strengthening Participatory Organization (SPO) has wide range of CBOs network in 10 union
councils of Muzaffargarh,Kot Addu and Jatoi tehsils in District Muzaffargarh. SPO is implementing
AAWAZ Project with the support of CCBs and LSOs and in this way CCBs and LSOs are functional.
Likewise, World Vision International (WVI) has also activated the already existing CCBs and LSOs as
well as established village organization for their development project.

The delimitation process in Muzaffargarh district
was started in 2013. There were objections from political leads regarding the delimitation process
and commented that the process in not transparent. Following the delimitation process was
stopped due lack of mutual consent by the political parties. Sources revealed that the hidden
agenda behind delimitation process was \u201cpolitical objectives and interests by the current
government PML-N in order to increase \u201cvote bank\u201d. This was due to the influence by political
parties that delimitation process was stopped and now new delimitation process is in process.
Muzaffargarh district is one of the backwards district of south Punjab. Citizens and particularly
women\u2019s empowerment is low in the district due to feudalistic and male dominated trends and
traditions. There are outworn cultural practices existing in the district which restricts the
opportunities of socio-economic and political empowerment of common citizens and particularly
for the vulnerable and marginalized families including in women and young girls.

(EDOHs, DOHs DDOHs), who have been tasked with the collection of performance related data from Basic
Health Units, Rural Health Centers, Tehsil and District Headquarters. The data submitted by these

strengthen monitoring and accountability through supervisory visits, setting targets and collecting
independent data. This will be accomplished through a team of MEAs. After due training MEAs will be
conducting independent visits to BHUs in all Districts of Punjab. Data collected by MEAs will help EDOs
and district managers better manage facilities in their districts. The data will also be used by the Health
Department to track progress on key initiatives and will be shared with the Chief Minister. 8
Online District Health Information System (DHIS) District Health Information System is a mechanism of
data collection, transmission, processing, and analysis and information feedback from health facilities.
This is a computerized online information system in Health Department which generates monthly reports
based on information on selected indicators collected from the health facilities. 9

prime objective was to institutionalize citizens\u2019 participation for improving governance and
accountability. Although, after the suspension of local government system now CCBs are not active
this may be due to lack of resources and funds. However, few of active and motivated activists
have made sure the sustainability of CCBs and local support organization (LSO) but their active
functionality is neither due to lack of finance resources and technical skills and capacities.
Strengthening Participatory Organization (SPO) has wide range of CBOs network in 10 union
councils of Muzaffargarh,Kot Addu and Jatoi tehsils in District Muzaffargarh. SPO is implementing
AAWAZ Project with the support of CCBs and LSOs and in this way CCBs and LSOs are functional.
Likewise, World Vision International (WVI) has also activated the already existing CCBs and LSOs as
well as established village organization for their development project.
