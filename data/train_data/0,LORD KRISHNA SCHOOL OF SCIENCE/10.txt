', The story is described in ', this chapter',  of the Srimad Bhagavatam:', 

', 
  ', Being the direct witness in the hearts of all living beings, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a fully understood why Sud\u0101m\u0101 had come to see Him. Thus He thought, \u201cIn the past My friend has never worshiped Me out of a desire for material opulence, but now he comes to Me to satisfy his chaste and devoted wife. ', I will give him riches that even the immortal gods cannot obtain.', \u201d Thinking like this, the Lord snatched from the br\u0101hma\u1e47a\u2019s garment the grains of flat rice tied up in an old piece of cloth and exclaimed, \u201cWhat is this? My friend, have You brought this for Me? It gives Me extreme pleasure. Indeed, ', these few grains of flat rice will satisfy not only Me but also the entire universe', .\u201d', 
  
  ', After saying this, the Supreme Lord ate one palmful and was about to eat a second when the devoted goddess Rukmi\u1e47\u012b took hold of His hand.  [Queen Rukmi\u1e47\u012b said:] "', This is more than enough, O Soul of the universe, to secure him an abundance of all kinds of wealth in this world and the next.',  After all, one\u2019s prosperity depends simply on Your satisfaction."', 
', 

', So Rukmini stopped him because Krishna's satisfaction at just one palmful of rice was already enough to give Sudama "an abundance of all kinds of wealth in this world and the next".', 

', By the way, the sentiment Krishna expresses when he says "these few grains of flat rice will satisfy not only Me but also the entire univers" occurs in the Mahabharata as well; when Draupadi has only a morsel of rice in her pot and she has to feed group of sages, Krishna eats that single morsel of rice and that is enough to satisfy him and thus the entire universe, leading the sages to feel full as well.  ', 

', Krishna expresses this notion earlier on in the chapter as well:', 

', 
  ', I regard as great even the smallest gift offered by My devotees in pure love, but even great offerings presented by nondevotees do not please Me.  If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, a fruit or water, I will accept it.',

', Sudama & Lord Krishna were friend from gurukul (school time friends). One day guru mata has given them "chura" (food) and send them in forest to collect wood for fire. Those were rainy days and in night Sudama got separate from Krishna because of heavy rain. In night Sudama started eating the "chura" and he himself finished all the "chura". Because of this this act he was debtor to Lord Krishna. ', 

', u"After leaving the gurukul, Sudama's life was running in very poor condition. He thought to meet his friend. Sudama's wife Susheela has given him  beaten rice for Lord Krishna. Because of poorness that  beaten rice was the only wealth with Sudama at that time, which he wanted to give his friend Krishna.  The beaten rice was of amount of three hand only.", 

', Seeing this ', Lord Krishna has started giving one by one lok', u" (like swarg lok, prithvi lok etc...) as he was eating one by one hand beaten rice. In two hand beaten rice Krishan has already given Sudama to Swarg lok & Prithvi lok's vaibhav. He was about to give his own Vaikunth dham for third hand beaten rice, seeing this Godess Laxmi stopped him and she her self ate third hand beaten rice and for that she blessed Sudama's wife by giving eternal beauty boon.",

', The story is described in ', this chapter',  of the Srimad Bhagavatam:', 

', 
  ', Being the direct witness in the hearts of all living beings, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a fully understood why Sud\u0101m\u0101 had come to see Him. Thus He thought, \u201cIn the past My friend has never worshiped Me out of a desire for material opulence, but now he comes to Me to satisfy his chaste and devoted wife. ', I will give him riches that even the immortal gods cannot obtain.', \u201d Thinking like this, the Lord snatched from the br\u0101hma\u1e47a\u2019s garment the grains of flat rice tied up in an old piece of cloth and exclaimed, \u201cWhat is this? My friend, have You brought this for Me? It gives Me extreme pleasure. Indeed, ', these few grains of flat rice will satisfy not only Me but also the entire universe', .\u201d', 
  
  ', After saying this, the Supreme Lord ate one palmful and was about to eat a second when the devoted goddess Rukmi\u1e47\u012b took hold of His hand.  [Queen Rukmi\u1e47\u012b said:] "', This is more than enough, O Soul of the universe, to secure him an abundance of all kinds of wealth in this world and the next.',  After all, one\u2019s prosperity depends simply on Your satisfaction."', 
', 

', So Rukmini stopped him because Krishna's satisfaction at just one palmful of rice was already enough to give Sudama "an abundance of all kinds of wealth in this world and the next".', 

', By the way, the sentiment Krishna expresses when he says "these few grains of flat rice will satisfy not only Me but also the entire univers" occurs in the Mahabharata as well; when Draupadi has only a morsel of rice in her pot and she has to feed group of sages, Krishna eats that single morsel of rice and that is enough to satisfy him and thus the entire universe, leading the sages to feel full as well.  ', 

', Krishna expresses this notion earlier on in the chapter as well:', 

', 
  ', I regard as great even the smallest gift offered by My devotees in pure love, but even great offerings presented by nondevotees do not please Me.  If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, a fruit or water, I will accept it.',

', Sudama & Lord Krishna were friend from gurukul (school time friends). One day guru mata has given them "chura" (food) and send them in forest to collect wood for fire. Those were rainy days and in night Sudama got separate from Krishna because of heavy rain. In night Sudama started eating the "chura" and he himself finished all the "chura". Because of this this act he was debtor to Lord Krishna. ', 

', u"After leaving the gurukul, Sudama's life was running in very poor condition. He thought to meet his friend. Sudama's wife Susheela has given him  beaten rice for Lord Krishna. Because of poorness that  beaten rice was the only wealth with Sudama at that time, which he wanted to give his friend Krishna.  The beaten rice was of amount of three hand only.", 

', Seeing this ', Lord Krishna has started giving one by one lok', u" (like swarg lok, prithvi lok etc...) as he was eating one by one hand beaten rice. In two hand beaten rice Krishan has already given Sudama to Swarg lok & Prithvi lok's vaibhav. He was about to give his own Vaikunth dham for third hand beaten rice, seeing this Godess Laxmi stopped him and she her self ate third hand beaten rice and for that she blessed Sudama's wife by giving eternal beauty boon.",
