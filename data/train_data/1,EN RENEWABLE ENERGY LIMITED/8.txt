                        ', Maks Renewable Energy Co. ltd has started its journey in 2009 as a system integrator towards renewable energy and focusing in the areas of Solar Home System, Solar roof top system, Solar irrigation pump system, wind mapping, and Bio-gas.', Within Short span of time MRECL has been able to take leading position in the above fields and has installed many solar home and pump systems, and also put up bio-gas plants. MRECL is a partner organization of IDCOL for Solar and Bio-Gas Program.', 
MRECL is also marketing and doing distribution of various solar powered products, such as, Table Fan, Stand Fan, TV, Lantern, Fridge, LED Lights, Charge Controller, Inverter, Panels, etc. The solar DC Fan marketed by MRECL has become extremely popular as it consumes only 10W power and within affordable reach of rural people, Since its first introduction from six months back, nearly about 10,000 unit fans sold back and demand is still growing. Similarly, Solar powered color LCD TV of low watt is gaining popularity.', 
Less than 50% area of our country has grid connection. Remaining areas are still in dark. Hence, seven years back IDCOL has introduced Solar Home System program with support from donor agencies to light up homes at off grid areas using solar power, so that life style of the people can be improved. The program has become extremely popular and successful. Until now over 1 million homes has been powered by Solar and it is growing at the pace of 50,000 homes per month.', 
This program is currently supplying only solar light, but there is huge demand for further comfort of modern life. So there is huge demand of Solar Fan, as well as Solar TV in remote areas where electricity is not an option. This is the market that has been explored and untapped by MRECL. ',
