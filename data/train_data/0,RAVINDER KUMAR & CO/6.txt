', Dr. Sinha conducted surveys of the entire length of the Ganges and most of its tributaries in India and Nepal to assess the distribution, population status, ecological requirements, and threats to the dolphin. The animal was facing extinction due to indiscriminate poaching and habitat degradation and loss in many areas. Dr. Sinha organized education and awareness programs among the local fishermen as well as secondary and college students. The national and international print and electronic media widely promoted his research and conservation efforts, attracting the attention of both national and international policy makers, executives, and scientific communities.', 
', He was designated as the "Dolphin Man of India" by ', Dr. S.Z. Qasim', , Member of the ', Planning Commission', , in the International Seminar on River Dolphins in Delhi in 1992. Dr. Sinha was invited to membership of the IUCN (International Union for conservation of Nature) headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland in 1994; was elected Fellow of the ', Linnean Society of London',  in 1996, and elected Chairman of the Asian River Dolphin Committee in 1997 under the aegis of the IUCN.', 
', Dr. Sinha has published over 100 ', research papers',  in peer-reviewed journals, four books, and over 40 technical and research reports primarily on the Ganges dolphin, river biodiversity, and Ganges pollution. In 2001, he accomplished the first ever rescue and translocation of a stranded pregnant dolphin.', 
', This Gangetic dolphin, which Dr Sinha is trying to conserve, is one of the only three obligate ', fresh water dolphins',  in the world, one of the most endangered mammals on earth; an endemic species of the Indian subcontinent; a natural aquatic heritage of India and an indicator species of the health of the Ganga system. The Gangetic dolphins have long been poached for the extraction of their body oil as a fish attractant for use in oil fishery. Dr. Sinha discovered an alternative made from fish scraps. By effectively communicating and popularizing this alternative among Indian fisherman, dolphin poaching has been significantly reduced. This discovery was published in the internationally reputed journal ', Biological Conservation',  (London). Dr. Sinha developed the Conservation Action Plan for the Gangetic Dolphin in 2010 which was enthusiastically accepted by the Government of India.', 
', Dr. Sinha is also known for his contribution in two famous documentaries ', Alert on the Ganges',  (26 minutes, French) and ', Mr. Dolphin Sinha: Think Globally and Act Locally',  (52 minutes, English) both produced by Mr. Christian Gallissian in 2007.', 
', Sri Jairam Ramesh', , Union Minister of Environment and Forests, highlighted Dr. Sinha\u2019s work in the ', Rajya Sabha',  on 8 March 2011 stating, "..one of the leading authorities on dolphin is a Professor. His name is R.K. Sinha, popularly called \u2018Dolphin Sinha.\u2019 With the help of people like him, we are trying to bring back the Gangetic dolphin which is unique heritage resource for India." ', Dr. Montek Singh Ahluwalia', , Deputy Chairman, Planning Commission of India attended dolphin watches in Patna in 2011 and 2012. His enthusiasm for Dr. Sinha\u2019s conservation efforts led him to establish the National Dolphin Research Center in Patna, now in progress.',

By effectively communicating and popularizing this alternative among Indian fisherman, dolphin poaching has been significantly reduced. This discovery was published in the internationally reputed journal ', Biological Conservation',  (London). Dr. Sinha developed the Conservation Action Plan for the Gangetic Dolphin in 2010 which was enthusiastically accepted by the Government of India.', 
', Dr. Sinha is also known for his contribution in two famous documentaries ', Alert on the Ganges',  (26 minutes, French) and ', Mr. Dolphin Sinha: Think Globally and Act Locally',  (52 minutes, English) both produced by Mr. Christian Gallissian in 2007.', 
', Sri Jairam Ramesh', , Union Minister of Environment and Forests, highlighted Dr. Sinha\u2019s work in the ', Rajya Sabha',  on 8 March 2011 stating, "..one of the leading authorities on dolphin is a Professor. His name is R.K. Sinha, popularly called \u2018Dolphin Sinha.\u2019 With the help of people like him, we are trying to bring back the Gangetic dolphin which is unique heritage resource for India." ', Dr. Montek Singh Ahluwalia', , Deputy Chairman, Planning Commission of India attended dolphin watches in Patna in 2011 and 2012. His enthusiasm for Dr. Sinha\u2019s conservation efforts led him to establish the National Dolphin Research Center in Patna, now in progress.',
