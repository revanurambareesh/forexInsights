Initially she started doing cycling for half an hour a day , later on she is cycling for an hour everyday . She is trying to cycle everyday , but at least she could manage to cycle once in every alternative day . The other day she is participating in other games / sports like running with her friend',

	When we moved to India and considered few schools for my kids (Sindhu & Vivek Nadipalli), I had a hard time to decide which is the right school for them. I compared Sreenidhi with some other top schools, and decided to admit them in Sreenidhi. Now I feel that I had taken a right decision to choose Sreenidhi, and never regretted about it. I wanted to tell you about it but never had an opportunity to do so. I thought it would be a good time to express my feedback since Sindhu is going to graduate and we lose ties with Sreenidhi. Reasons for appreciation:', 
', 
	1. All the teaching and non-teaching staff are very professional, and take care of the students like their own kids, and take care of the parents like special guests.', 
', 
	 ', 
', u"
	2. In case of any information or help, it's instant and accurate.", 
', 
	 ', 
', 
	3. Teachers are very friendly and proficient in their subjects.', 
', 
	 ', 
', 
	4. Open door policy. Somebody could come directly and see any of the staff member without any appointment.', 
', 
	 ', 
', 
	5. Very considerable. Especially, Santosh sir and Shanmugam sir.', 
', 
	 ', 
', u"
	Vivek has completed his 10th grade from Sreenidhi International, and now he's studying six year Medicine program in Youngstown State University in Ohio, US. He says that he misses the school.", 
', 
	 ', 
', u"
	After Sindhs 8th Grade we wanted to move Sindhu to a different school because of the commuting from our home. She strongly resisted to move from Sreenidhi. That shows how much she loves her school and what she is doing at the school.", 
', 
	Once I needed something from you and I contacted Santosh sir. Sanotsh sir got it done within no time, and I submitted that letter to the US Institution. Unfortunately, the Institution wanted in a different format. It repeated several times but you both never showed your frustration, and cooperated through the end process. I have no more words to say about Sreenidhi but we are going to miss it once Sindhu graduates. Sorry to lose the connection with you all. Especially, Santosh sir Shanmugam sir and Saraswathi madam.',

	Surekha took an action by cycling everyday , after knowing the importance of doing physical activity in the exhibition classes . Initially she started doing cycling for half an hour a day , later on she is cycling for an hour everyday . She is trying to cycle everyday , but at least she could manage to cycle once in every alternative day . The other day she is participating in other games / sports like running with her friend',

	When we moved to India and considered few schools for my kids (Sindhu & Vivek Nadipalli), I had a hard time to decide which is the right school for them. I compared Sreenidhi with some other top schools, and decided to admit them in Sreenidhi. Now I feel that I had taken a right decision to choose Sreenidhi, and never regretted about it. I wanted to tell you about it but never had an opportunity to do so. I thought it would be a good time to express my feedback since Sindhu is going to graduate and we lose ties with Sreenidhi. Reasons for appreciation:', 
', 
	1. All the teaching and non-teaching staff are very professional, and take care of the students like their own kids, and take care of the parents like special guests.', 
', 
	 ', 
', u"
	2. In case of any information or help, it's instant and accurate.", 
', 
	 ', 
', 
	3. Teachers are very friendly and proficient in their subjects.', 
', 
	 ', 
', 
	4. Open door policy. Somebody could come directly and see any of the staff member without any appointment.', 
', 
	 ', 
', 
	5. Very considerable. Especially, Santosh sir and Shanmugam sir.', 
', 
	 ', 
', u"
	Vivek has completed his 10th grade from Sreenidhi International, and now he's studying six year Medicine program in Youngstown State University in Ohio, US. He says that he misses the school.", 
', 
	 ', 
', u"
	After Sindhs 8th Grade we wanted to move Sindhu to a different school because of the commuting from our home. She strongly resisted to move from Sreenidhi. That shows how much she loves her school and what she is doing at the school.", 
', 
	Once I needed something from you and I contacted Santosh sir. Sanotsh sir got it done within no time, and I submitted that letter to the US Institution. Unfortunately, the Institution wanted in a different format. It repeated several times but you both never showed your frustration, and cooperated through the end process. I have no more words to say about Sreenidhi but we are going to miss it once Sindhu graduates. Sorry to lose the connection with you all. Especially, Santosh sir Shanmugam sir and Saraswathi madam.',

	 ', 
', 
	Please keep up good work.',
