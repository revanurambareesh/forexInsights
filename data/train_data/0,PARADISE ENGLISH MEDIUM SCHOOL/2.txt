        ', About', 
        ', 
          ', The relaxed atmosphere and the warm welcome of the Filipino people make the Philippines a well-known tourist destination. But, tourist destination it may be, it does not mean that it is not an ideal place to live in. If you are looking for better job opportunities in teaching, the Philippines is one of the best places you can ever find.', 

', Aside from the tropical heat and the glamorous beaches it offers, many migrants from neighboring Asian countries move to this country in search for excellence in using the English language.', 

', Established in this country are universities which offer state-of-the-art facilities. This is to ensure that students are given the highest quality of education. Although Filipinos often use the Tagalog language to communicate, these universities use English as a medium to guarantee that both foreign and local students are globally competitive.', 

', Photo Credits: ', Rick McCharles', .',         ', 
      ', 
          ', 
        ', Job Types', 
        ', 
          ', The Philippines is a competitive job market, but those who take their job search seriously and present themselves well are still able to find work without too much difficulty.', 

', Technical and Vocational Education', 

', Run either by the government or private sectors, technical and vocational education aims to mold the skills of local and foreign students. These institutions should be approved by TESDA (Technical Education and Skills Development). To complete the courses these colleges offer, students must complete their training for a couple of weeks to 2 years.',   

', Private Language Academies/Institutions', 

', u"This is the most popular option of English teachers from abroad since many Filipino inhabitants find it best to study in these institutions. Private Language Academies are abundant in many highly urbanized cities in the Philippines. If you opt to apply in one of these establishments, you should expect to teach locals who already have their Bachelor's Degree.", 

', Not only do these academies welcome graduates from accredited universities, they also have undergraduates assistants. Now, since many Filipinos are planning to migrate elsewhere, review centers for TOEFL, GREs and IELTS have also created their own mini-industry. Applying for such is an easy prospect since you only have to do well in one of these examinations for these institutions to consider your application. ', 

', Tutoring', 

', One of the best ways to earn a sumptuous amount through teaching in the Philippines is conducting one-on-one tutorials. Not only will this be less time-consuming, it will also guarantee high earnings. If you already have a teaching job in this country, it will be very easy for you to market yourself to the students.', 

', Private Schools', 

', If you are more fond of educating the youth, it will be best for you to apply on different primary and secondary schools. These are usually established by private sectors and it will be best to teach here if you are looking for a more peaceful environment. However, these schools have lower salary rates than private institutions and you must be aware that your salary will only equal the income of local Filipino teachers.',         ', 
      ', 
          ', 
        ', Finding a Job', 
        ', 
          ', u"In contrary to popular belief, the Philippines' economy is rising and the cost of living is very low. This gives you the chance to earn more while enjoying a laid-back atmosphere. You can also find a lot of job opportunities in the country's capital city, Manila. There, both private and government-run institutions are highly copious. Plus, the capital's neighboring city, Pampanga, also offers a lot of teaching opportunities as it has numerous academies and review centers.", 

', Location', 

', Where you want to live can affect your job search. Being flexible with your location will help a lot, as will a willingness to teach a wide variety of age ranges.',  

', While many people are attracted to the big cities in Europe, the region of Southeast Asia, and the Philippines in particular, can present some great opportunities for English teachers as well. The cost of living in the Global South is generally lower too, while teaching salaries are usually comparable to the Global North.',         ', 
      ', 
          ', 
        ', Need to Know', 
        ', 
          ', Classroom and Work Culture', 

', As mentioned earlier, the workload of teachers in the Philippines is a lot lighter. The working hours vary on where you would like to practice your profession. If you are planning to teach in a private institution which offers review classes for varying International English examinations, you can enjoy an hourly rate, and the classes usually run for 8 hours a day. If you are, however, more interested in applying to private schools, the classes usually start at around 7 a.m. to 5 p.m.', 

', u"Since Filipinos are warm-hearted in nature, it is customary for them to greet each other by smiling or by kissing each other on the cheeks. For formal occasions, men and women tend to shake each other's hands.", 

', u"When it comes to punctuality, although Filipinos are known to lose track of time whenever they attend social gatherings, teachers should remember that punctuality is a must in their teaching job. This is to inculcate the sense of responsibility to the students, for teaching in this country does not only require the capability to enhance students' skills, but to raise the moral values of the locals ",

        ', 
          ', The relaxed atmosphere and the warm welcome of the Filipino people make the Philippines a well-known tourist destination. But, tourist destination it may be, it does not mean that it is not an ideal place to live in. If you are looking for better job opportunities in teaching, the Philippines is one of the best places you can ever find.', 

', Aside from the tropical heat and the glamorous beaches it offers, many migrants from neighboring Asian countries move to this country in search for excellence in using the English language.', 

', Established in this country are universities which offer state-of-the-art facilities. This is to ensure that students are given the highest quality of education. Although Filipinos often use the Tagalog language to communicate, these universities use English as a medium to guarantee that both foreign and local students are globally competitive.', 

', Photo Credits: ', Rick McCharles', .',         ', 
      ', 
          ', 
        ', Job Types', 
        ', 
          ', The Philippines is a competitive job market, but those who take their job search seriously and present themselves well are still able to find work without too much difficulty.', 

', Technical and Vocational Education', 

', Run either by the government or private sectors, technical and vocational education aims to mold the skills of local and foreign students. These institutions should be approved by TESDA (Technical Education and Skills Development). To complete the courses these colleges offer, students must complete their training for a couple of weeks to 2 years.',   

', Private Language Academies/Institutions', 

', u"This is the most popular option of English teachers from abroad since many Filipino inhabitants find it best to study in these institutions. Private Language Academies are abundant in many highly urbanized cities in the Philippines. If you opt to apply in one of these establishments, you should expect to teach locals who already have their Bachelor's Degree.", 

', Not only do these academies welcome graduates from accredited universities, they also have undergraduates assistants. Now, since many Filipinos are planning to migrate elsewhere, review centers for TOEFL, GREs and IELTS have also created their own mini-industry. Applying for such is an easy prospect since you only have to do well in one of these examinations for these institutions to consider your application. ', 

', Tutoring', 

', One of the best ways to earn a sumptuous amount through teaching in the Philippines is conducting one-on-one tutorials. Not only will this be less time-consuming, it will also guarantee high earnings. If you already have a teaching job in this country, it will be very easy for you to market yourself to the students.', 

', Private Schools', 

', If you are more fond of educating the youth, it will be best for you to apply on different primary and secondary schools. These are usually established by private sectors and it will be best to teach here if you are looking for a more peaceful environment. However, these schools have lower salary rates than private institutions and you must be aware that your salary will only equal the income of local Filipino teachers.',         ', 
      ', 
          ', 
        ', Finding a Job', 
        ', 
          ', u"In contrary to popular belief, the Philippines' economy is rising and the cost of living is very low. This gives you the chance to earn more while enjoying a laid-back atmosphere. You can also find a lot of job opportunities in the country's capital city, Manila. There, both private and government-run institutions are highly copious. Plus, the capital's neighboring city, Pampanga, also offers a lot of teaching opportunities as it has numerous academies and review centers.", 

', Location', 

', Where you want to live can affect your job search. Being flexible with your location will help a lot, as will a willingness to teach a wide variety of age ranges.',  

', While many people are attracted to the big cities in Europe, the region of Southeast Asia, and the Philippines in particular, can present some great opportunities for English teachers as well. The cost of living in the Global South is generally lower too, while teaching salaries are usually comparable to the Global North.',         ', 
      ', 
          ', 
        ', Need to Know', 
        ', 
          ', Classroom and Work Culture', 

', As mentioned earlier, the workload of teachers in the Philippines is a lot lighter. The working hours vary on where you would like to practice your profession. If you are planning to teach in a private institution which offers review classes for varying International English examinations, you can enjoy an hourly rate, and the classes usually run for 8 hours a day. If you are, however, more interested in applying to private schools, the classes usually start at around 7 a.m. to 5 p.m.', 

', u"Since Filipinos are warm-hearted in nature, it is customary for them to greet each other by smiling or by kissing each other on the cheeks. For formal occasions, men and women tend to shake each other's hands.", 

', u"When it comes to punctuality, although Filipinos are known to lose track of time whenever they attend social gatherings, teachers should remember that punctuality is a must in their teaching job. This is to inculcate the sense of responsibility to the students, for teaching in this country does not only require the capability to enhance students' skills, but to raise the moral values of the locals ",
