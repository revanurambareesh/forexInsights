', The Management Education Institute, later the Arthur D. Little School of Management, was founded in 1964 by ', Arthur D. Little Inc', u", the world's oldest management consulting firm. The institution developed a one-year ", postgraduate', u" degree program in management that was launched as the school's first program. Only five years earlier, in 1959, the Ashridge Management College was established in the United Kingdom. Among Ashridge's initial partners were companies like ", Shell', , ', Guinness',  and ', Unilever', . Ten years later, in 1969, Ashridge had expanded its operations to include more than 100 programs and more than 2,000 annual participants. Arthur D. Little School of Management was accredited by the ', New England Association of Schools and Colleges',  in 1976, allowing for higher academic integrity in a city where universities like ', Harvard',  had thrived for more than a century.', 
', Because of financial difficulties, the school was acquired by ', Bertil Hult', u" and renamed Hult International Business School in 2003. The school was going to build on a new concept, with an international focus. The goal was to open new campuses around the world and accept international students from countries around the world in order to establish a learning environment that let its students not only learn about business from the school's professors, but also about each other's cultures. In 2008, Hult opened its first campus outside the United States in Dubai, U.A.E. Only a year later, the school also opened a campus in London. In 2010, Hult opened its second campus in the United States, in downtown San Francisco. Finally, in 2011, Hult opened a campus in Shanghai, China.", 
', In 2015, Hult International Business School and Ashridge Business School operationally merged under the common brand Hult International Business School. Ashridge Business School was renamed ', Ashridge Executive Education, Hult', .', [2]',

', The Management Education Institute, later the Arthur D. Little School of Management, was founded in 1964 by ', Arthur D. Little Inc', u", the world's oldest management consulting firm. The institution developed a one-year ", postgraduate', u" degree program in management that was launched as the school's first program. Only five years earlier, in 1959, the Ashridge Management College was established in the United Kingdom. Among Ashridge's initial partners were companies like ", Shell', , ', Guinness',  and ', Unilever', . Ten years later, in 1969, Ashridge had expanded its operations to include more than 100 programs and more than 2,000 annual participants. Arthur D. Little School of Management was accredited by the ', New England Association of Schools and Colleges',  in 1976, allowing for higher academic integrity in a city where universities like ', Harvard',  had thrived for more than a century.', 
', Because of financial difficulties, the school was acquired by ', Bertil Hult', u" and renamed Hult International Business School in 2003. The school was going to build on a new concept, with an international focus. The goal was to open new campuses around the world and accept international students from countries around the world in order to establish a learning environment that let its students not only learn about business from the school's professors, but also about each other's cultures. In 2008, Hult opened its first campus outside the United States in Dubai, U.A.E. Only a year later, the school also opened a campus in London. In 2010, Hult opened its second campus in the United States, in downtown San Francisco. Finally, in 2011, Hult opened a campus in Shanghai, China.", 
', In 2015, Hult International Business School and Ashridge Business School operationally merged under the common brand Hult International Business School. Ashridge Business School was renamed ', Ashridge Executive Education, Hult', .', [2]',
