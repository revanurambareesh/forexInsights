', Our nation\u2019s criminal justice system faces a crisis of confidence. For too long, our country\u2019s criminal justice system has prioritized being \u201ctough on crime\u201d and offered a reactive approach to crime without addressing its root causes, and the overwhelming majority of criminal justice data shows communities of color and those in our society with the least advantages too often bear the heaviest burdens. Our broken system robs individuals of opportunity and deprives communities of hope. It\u2019s also horribly wasteful. Our criminal justice system\u2019s current focus on reaction instead of prevention doesn\u2019t just exacerbate inequities that exist in our society, it also costs taxpayers much more and makes our streets less safe. Kamala believes that all of us \u2013 neighbors, business leaders, law enforcement, activists and government leaders at every level \u2013 have a role to play in the fight for a smarter and fairer criminal justice system, one that lives up to the ideals of equality and justice that our nation was founded upon.', 
', To design a better and more effective criminal justice system, we must redouble our efforts to build and maintain trust between law enforcement and all of the communities they are sworn to serve. As a career prosecutor and as the top law enforcement officer in California, Kamala has worked side by side with law enforcement officers her entire career. The reality is police officers put their lives on the line every day to protect and serve the public, and the vast majority do so honorably. Kamala has seen firsthand how communities of color want law enforcement in their communities \u2013 police who act fairly and impartially to strengthen neighborhoods and enhance public safety. And led by California, many agencies across the country are developing innovative models for community policing. As a civil rights leader, Kamala knows that racial profiling exists and that unfair or unreasonable stops cause great harm \u2013 not just to individuals but also to communites\u2019 faith in police and government. And we all can agree that when an officer acts on prejudice or implicit bias, it unfairly undermines the reputation of all of their colleagues.', 
', Even as we begin to see greater awareness and innovation, policy-makers and the public must acknowledge this broader reality \u2013 data show boys and men of color face disproportionate profiling and use of force from law enforcement. The summer of 2016 has been a snapshot of what communities of color in America have experienced for generations, but now we can all see it through a smartphone or a body camera.', 
', Trust is a reciprocal relationship, and the public and law enforcement need each other to keep our communities safe. There is now a national conversation that highlights the need for work to build that trust. And Congress also needs to act. ', Racial profiling, bias and the lack of trust between law enforcement and communities of color are national problems and they beg national solutions.', 
', And we know the job of keeping our communities\u2019 safe can\u2019t fall upon police alone. We must reform our criminal justice system to be Smart on Crime and insist on a better return on our investment. By focusing on crime prevention, recidivism reduction, and innovative, data-driven methods, we can make our system fair, efficient and effective \u2013 and create safer communities.', 
', That\u2019s why, in the Senate, Kamala will fight for innovative, fair and impartial police practices across America, and continue to work to reform our broader criminal justice system:', 
', Speak the Truth', 
', 
', Collect Standard Policing Data For Every Community in America to Ensure Accountability. ', As California\u2019s Attorney General, Kamala created a first-of-its kind criminal justice open data initiative. It brought transparency to California\u2019s criminal justice data, exposing striking disparities that exist by race/ethnicity, gender, and age in policing practices. She has also pushed to create consistency in how data is collected in California. In the Senate, Kamala will call for national standards for the collection and reporting of criminal justice data. She will work to create federal incentives for every law enforcement agency to collect and report uniform, standard data on stops, arrest rates, use of force incidents (including officer involved shootings), citizen complaints, charging and filing, convictions, sentencing, recidivism, deaths in custody, and law enforcement officers killed or assaulted in the line of duty', 
', 
', Insist on Transparency', 
', 
', Publish Data for All Law Enforcement Agencies In One Place:',  The public should be able to see how law enforcement agencies are performing compared to each other, and whether efforts to improve policing are working. In California, Kamala launched a groundbreaking, award-winning open data portal that provides access and easy-to-use dashboards for the public to see the state\u2019s criminal justice data. In the Senate, Kamala will work to create a federal open data portal for all criminal justice data so everyone will be empowered with the tools they need to evaluate the performance of their own community\u2019s criminal justice system.', 
', Expand the Responsible Use of Body-Worn Cameras:',  As Attorney General, Kamala created a pilot program in California to develop best practices on the use of body-worn cameras, and convened law enforcement leaders to encourage their adoption and best use. In the Senate, Kamala will work to promote the adoption of body-worn cameras around the country to improve transparency, accountability and training.', 
', 
', Build Trust', 
', 
', Provide National Training On Implicit Bias and Procedural Justice: ', Under Kamala\u2019s leadership, the California Department of Justice was the first in the nation to create a statewide certified training program for law enforcement on both implicit bias and procedural justice. In the Senate, she\u2019ll make the course a national model and call for funding and incentives to implement it across the country along with extensive training on use of force and community policing.', 
', Expand Training On Crisis Response:',  Many critical incidents between the community and police occur in a matter of seconds \u2013 the decision of whether someone is a threat, or whether they have a weapon, and how to respond. Law enforcement needs more resources to train for a range of complex and difficult scenarios \u2013 including de-escalation, tactical retreat, active shooter, and mental health crisis intervention \u2013 and the federal government must help provide those resources. Kamala will advocate for funding to support evidence-based crisis response training for law enforcement officers nationwide', 
', Improve Diversity in Law Enforcement:',  Our law enforcement agencies should look like the communities they serve. In the California Department of Justice, Kamala modified hiring requirements to create a more diverse applicant pool for special agents and trainees. As a Senator, Kamala will work to build more pipelines to law enforcement careers for people from all backgrounds, including supporting criminal justice majors and coursework at institutions with high percentages of students of color like Historically Black Colleges and Universities, increasing law enforcement recruitment on those campuses, and incentives for officers to live in the communities they police, where their presence can reduce crime and build personal relationships critical to mutual understanding and trust.', 
', Funding For More Federal Civil Rights Investigations:',  Our U.S. Department of Justice doesn\u2019t have the resources or capacity to investigate every law enforcement agency in need of reform. Congress needs to fund more pattern-or-practice investigations and collaborative reform efforts to bring about needed reforms in departments that have violated civil rights laws and to help law enforcement develop clear protocols and standards for handling officer misconduct. Kamala will fight to expand the Department\u2019s ability to independently investigate civil rights violations across the country and create incentives for law enforcement to immediately correct bad, discriminatory or unlawful practices and to usher in more systemic reforms.', 
', 
', The Bigger Picture \u2013 Smart on Crime', 
', 
', Prevent & Reduce Recidivism:',  More than half of all released prisoners are back behind bars within three years. As Attorney General, Kamala created the Division of Recidivism Reduction and Re-entry to lead the California Department of Justice and law enforcement agencies across the state on preventing crime and reducing recidivism\u2014not just reacting to crime after the fact. In the Senate, Kamala will strengthen U.S. Department of Justice grant programs to fund local, comprehensive reentry and anti-recidivism initiatives, like her successful Back On Track model.', 
', End Mass Incarceration:',  For several decades, politicians have promoted \u201ctough on crime\u201d laws and long sentences based on the myth that public safety is best served when we treat all offenders the same way, regardless of the severity of their offense. As Senator, Kamala would lead efforts to reform ineffective, draconian sentencing laws for nonviolent offenders and encourage innovation across the criminal justice system. In addition, she will work to implement proven strategies to prevent crime, such as increasing access to job training and secure housing to help former inmates rebuild their lives. Kamala will also champion the closure of private prisons and immigration detention centers \u2013 mass incarceration should not be guided by corporate profit motives.', 
', Eliminate Harsh Lifetime Consequences For Non-Violent Offenders:',  Kamala believes nonviolent offenders should not have to live with the lifetime consequences of a conviction that prevent them from becoming contributing members of their communities. The lifetime consequences of a conviction often include limited access to employment, education, housing, food, and voting, which reduces the economic independence of former inmates and increases the likelihood of recidivism. As Senator, she would champion efforts to expunge certain criminal records after seven years of good behavior for individuals who have already served their time. Kamala will also push for federal \u201cban the box\u201d legislation, so prior convictions don\u2019t automatically prevent a qualified applicant from getting a job. And she will fight to end federal bans on student loans, food stamps, housing, and voting rights for those who have completed their sentence.',
