Adani ventured into the power sector in 2006 with its first project at Mundra, Gujarat by installing 4 x 330 MW units. As the business evolved from a single project single location company, to a multi projects multi geographies organization, Adani Infra (India) Limited took shape as the in-house EPC arm of Adani Power Limited and took forward execution of all its projects.', Adani Infra (India) Limited developed internal capabilities by experience of execution. Today, it has strong capabilities across all facets of capital project execution right from Project Management, Engineering, Procurement, and Construction to Commissioning. With its experience at Mundra (4 x 330 MW & 5 x 660MW), Adani Infra can boast of having the fastest execution time of projects in the industry. Adani Infra also has to its credit the 40MW solar power project executed in a record time of 5 months.', As Adani Power moved ahead to complete the value chain in power supply, Adani Infra took the lead and forayed into power transmission. The first line to be commissioned was the 400 kV, 430 km long double circuit line from Mundra to Dehgam. Adani Infra achieved a landmark with completion of about 1000 km long 500kV bi-pole HVDC line connecting Mundra in Gujarat to Mohindergarh in Haryana. This became the first HVDC line by any private player in India and connects western grid to northern grid. Today, Adani Infra has achieved installation of approximately 5500 circuit kms of transmission lines across the nation.',
