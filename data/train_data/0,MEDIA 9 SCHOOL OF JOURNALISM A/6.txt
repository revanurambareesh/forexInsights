', A ', journalism school',  is a ', school',  or department, usually part of an established ', university', , where ', journalists', u" are trained. An increasingly used term for a journalism department, school or college is 'J-School'. Many of the most famous and respected ", journalists',  of the past and present had no formal training in ', journalism', , but learned their craft on the job, often starting out as ', copy boys', /', copy girls', . Today, in many parts of the world it is usual for journalists to first complete ', university', -level training which incorporates both technical skills such as research skills, interviewing technique and ', shorthand',  and academic studies in ', media theory', , ', cultural studies',  and ', ethics', .', 
', Historically, in the ', United Kingdom',  entrants used first to complete a non media-studies related degree course, giving maximum educational breadth, prior to taking a specialist postgraduate pre-entry course. However, this has changed over the last ten years with journalism training and education moving to higher educational institutions. There are now over 60 universities in the UK offering BA honours degrees in journalism. Postgraduate courses are more well-established, some of which are either recognised by the ', National Union of Journalists',  (NUJ) or the ', National Council for the Training of Journalists',  (NCTJ).',

The ACEJMCC has awarded accreditation to 109 university and college programs of study in journalism and mass communications, but does not attempt to rank the courses or programs. It accredits colleges, schools, departments or divisions.',

', A ', journalism school',  is a ', school',  or department, usually part of an established ', university', , where ', journalists', u" are trained. An increasingly used term for a journalism department, school or college is 'J-School'. Many of the most famous and respected ", journalists',  of the past and present had no formal training in ', journalism', , but learned their craft on the job, often starting out as ', copy boys', /', copy girls', . Today, in many parts of the world it is usual for journalists to first complete ', university', -level training which incorporates both technical skills such as research skills, interviewing technique and ', shorthand',  and academic studies in ', media theory', , ', cultural studies',  and ', ethics', .', 
', Historically, in the ', United Kingdom',  entrants used first to complete a non media-studies related degree course, giving maximum educational breadth, prior to taking a specialist postgraduate pre-entry course. However, this has changed over the last ten years with journalism training and education moving to higher educational institutions. There are now over 60 universities in the UK offering BA honours degrees in journalism. Postgraduate courses are more well-established, some of which are either recognised by the ', National Union of Journalists',  (NUJ) or the ', National Council for the Training of Journalists',  (NCTJ).',

', A listing (unranked) of ', Canadian',  journalism schools has been assembled by Canadian-Universities.net.', [32]',  Journalism schools are listed and classified on the "J-Schools & Programs" page of', [33]', 
', In the ', United States',  the Accrediting Council on Education in Journalism and Mass Communications (ACEJMC)', [34]',  applies nine standards in evaluating university programs: mission, governance and administration; curriculum and instruction; diversity and inclusiveness; full-time and part-time faculty; scholarship: research, creative and professional activity; student services; resources, facilities and equipment; professional and public service; and assessment of learning outcomes. The ACEJMCC has awarded accreditation to 109 university and college programs of study in journalism and mass communications, but does not attempt to rank the courses or programs. It accredits colleges, schools, departments or divisions.', 
', u"The listing of a unit as accredited indicates that the unit has been judged by ACEJMC to meet its standards. That judgment is rendered after a self-study prepared by the faculty and administration of the unit and an independent evaluation of the unit by educators and practitioners. The listing shows the bachelor's and professional master's degree programs that were examined during the unit's most recent accreditation review. Some units offer degrees in addition to those listed here. ACEJMC does not accredit programs leading to the Ph.D., which is considered a research (and not a professional) degree. The Council does not list sequences or specialties.", 
', There are only four graduate-only journalism programs in North America: ', Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism', , ', CUNY',  School of Journalism, ', UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism',  and ', University of British Columbia',  Graduate School of Journalism, although many universities have graduate programs such as the ', Henry W. Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication',  at the ', University of Georgia',  that has a Master of Arts in Journalism and Mass Communication (M.A.), a Master of Arts in Health and Medical Journalism (M.A.), and a Doctor of Philosophy in Mass Communication (Ph.D).', 
', Editor & Publisher',  has presented an unranked list of leading journalism schools,', [35]',  while ', U.S. News & World Report',  produces annual lists of the top schools in advertising, print, and other categories based on responses to questionnaires sent to deans and faculty members.', [', citation needed', ]',  A list based on a variety of resources claims to identify the "ten most popular journalism schools in the United States".', [36]', u" One critic has pointed to the anecdotal nature of much j-school ranking in the absence of effective tracking of journalism graduates' career paths.", [37]', 
', South America', [', edit', ]', 
', An evaluation of developments in journalism education in Latin America has been undertaken by Professor Rosental Calmon Alves.', [38]', 
', Colombia', [', edit', ]', 
', In Colombia, the high court determined in 1998 that journalism was not a career. This High court said that journalism is a human right, not a profession.', 
', Because of the ruling there are many schools of communications in Colombia where people study to work in mainly enterprises, but not in mass media', 
', There are only two schools of journalism:', 
', University of Antioquia, a public institution in Medellín, offers Journalism inside the Communications faculty.', [39]',  And University of Rosario in Bogotá, a private institution offers Public Opinion Journalism', [40]', 
', Chile', [', edit', ]', 
', Chilean universities with journalism impart the profession as a full five-year degree. With a grade of "bachelor in social communications" and professional title of Journalist, currently exist more than 30 journalism schools in the country. The national system have an accrediting council that independently certifies the universities as a whole and each of the careers. Nevertheless, only a few are accredited.', 
', The top schools in the country are the Faculty of Communications of the ', Pontifical Catholic University of Chile', u", accredited by US's ACEJMC, and the Institute of Communication and Image of the ", University of Chile', , accredited by the National Accrediting Council (CNA). Outside Santiago, the top school is the School of Journalism of the ', Pontifical Catholic University of Valparaiso', , also accredited by the CNA.', 
', Debate about role', [', edit', ]', 
', One of the most cited critiques of a journalism school was ', Michael Lewis', u"'s article in ", The New Republic',  (1993), "J-school ate my brain",', [41]',  which was strongly criticized by ', University of Maryland',  College of Journalism dean ', Reese Cleghorn',  in ', American Journalism Review', .', [42]',  Discussion of the issues raised by Lewis was evident a decade later in the ', Chronicle of Higher Education',  colloquy on journalism education,', [43]',  ', Columbia Journalism Review', u"'", s "Searching for the perfect j-school",', [44]',  and "The j-school debate" in the Christian Science Monitor.', [45]', u" Alternative approaches to journalism education were suggested in Jack Shafer's ", Slate',  article "Can J-school be saved? Professional advice for Columbia University".', [46]',  An article in ', The Australian',  discusses "What makes a good school of journalism".', [47]', 
', On the internet, a range of ', weblogs',  have been set up by journalism students to chronicle or to criticize their journalism colleges. Examples are: ', "jschoolyear"', , ', "jschool05"', , ', "the pod" blogspot', , ', "jschool" blog, Australia', . An example of a weblog criticising university journalism education in Australia is "What's wrong with the school".', [48]',  One journalism school in the UK, at the University of Westminster,', [49]',  has established a clearing house where all students are expected to contribute to the development and content of their own education and training using blogs.', 
', Various commentaries on journalism education are related to criticisms of contemporary ', news media',  standards and values. One example is a paper by Jan Schaffer, executive director of J-Lab: the Institute for Interactive Journalism. ', [50]', u" A controversial paper to Australia's peak newspaper industry body ", PANPA',  (Pacific Area Newspaper Publishers Association) by Professor ', John Henningham',  ("Journalism sold short in media courses") blamed industry lack of interest and university cost-cutting for falling standards in journalism education.', [51]',  In Canada, Mark Anderson of the ', Ottawa Citizen',  has argued the case for teaching ', business journalism',  in college rather than on the job.', [52]',  Canadian journalism professor Rick MacLean has rejected criticism by Robert Fulford ("Just what is the point of j-school") that the best potential journalists will find their way into the media, while many existing j-school students show no interest in news or the media. MacLean argues that education in journalism helps empower members of the public to understand how media work.', [53]',
