HEADNOTE:
A dispute covering claims made by the employees was referred
for adjudication to the tribunal by the State Government of.
West  Bengal.  The appellant raised a preliminary  objection
against	 the validity of the reference and urged that  under
s. 2(a) the appropriate Government which could make a  valid
reference in relation to the present dispute was the Central
Government and not the Government of West Bengal and so, the
reference was unauthorised and incompetent and the  Tribunal
bad  no	 jurisdiction to deal with it.	The  Tribunal  over-
ruled this objection and the  case was set down for  hearing
on   the  merits.   Against  this  finding,  the   appellant
preferred  the present appeal by special leave and the	only
point  raised was that the head office of the  appellant  at
Calcutta being an integral part of the mine, any  industrial
dispute	 between  the said office and its  employees  is  an
industrial dispute-concerning a mine under',  s. 2(a)(i)',  and so
the  appropriate Government must be the	 Central  Government
and not the State Government.  The question for decision was
whether the present dispute can be said to be an  industrial
dispute	 concerning  a mine.  It was argued  that  the	word
"industry"  is wide enough to include the Head Office  of  a
mining company though, it may be situated away from the
 935
place  where the mining operations are actually	 carried  on
and  it is in the light of the said definition of  the	word
"industry" contained in',  s. 2(j)',  that the words "in  relation
to a mine" must be construed.
Held, that in construing the words-,,an industrial  dispute"
in  relation to a mine, it must first be determined  what  a
mine  means  and it must be done without  reference  to	 the
broad definition of industry prescribed by',  s. 2',  j).  In	 the
absence	 of  a	definition of the word "mine"  in  the(	 Act
itself, what has to be taken into account is the  dictionary
meaning	 of the word "mine" or as is contained in the  ', Mines
Act',  and judged in that light, there can be no difficulty  in
holding	 that  an industrial dispute between  the  employees
engaged	 in the Head Office at Calcutta and the employer  is
not  an	 industrial  dispute concerning a  mine.   The	Head
Office is not a mine and so, an industrial dispute raised by
the  employees	engaged.  in  the  head	 office	 is  not  an
industrial dispute concerning a mine.
The rights conferred on the lessee under a mining lease	 can
have  no direct bearing on the construction of',  s.  2(a)', 	 and
therefore,  the	 tribunal rightly. held,  that	the  present
dispute between the appellant and its employees at its	Head
Office at Calcutta is not a dispute in relation to a mine.
Held, further that all industrial disputes which are outside
s. 2(a)(i) are _the concern of the State Government under',  s.
2(a)(ii)', ;  in  other  words, the general  rule	is  that  an
industrial  dispute  arising  between  a  employer  and	 his
employees  would be referred for adjudication by  the  State
Government except in cases falling under',  s. 2(a)',  (i); and so
it  is	the extent of one of the exception mentioned  in ',  s.
2(a)(i)', 	 that has to be determined in the present case,	 and
in  determining the extent of the said exception,  it  would
not  be	 irrelevant  to	 bear  in  mind	 the  scope  of	 the
provisions  of the ', Mines Act',  itself.  That is why  the	fact
that an office of a mine is outside the definition of a mine
is of some assistance in interpreting the word "mine"  under
s.  2(a)(1) and therefore, the tribunal rightly came to	 the
conclusion  that  in the present case the reference  by	 the
State Government of West Bengal was valid.



JUDGMENT:
', CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION : Civil Appeal No. 355 of 1961.
Appeal by special leave from the order No. 28 dated  January
17, 1961, of the fourth Industrial Tribunal, West Bengal  in
Case No. VIII-71.
', 936', 
', P.K. Sanyal and D. N. Mukherjee, for the appellants.
Janardan Sharma, for the respondents.
', 1962.	March, 19.  The Judgment of the Court was  delivered
by
GAJENDREGADKAR,	 J.-This  appeal by special leave  raises  a
very  short  question about the construction of	 a  part  of
section	 2(a)  of  the	Industrial  Disputes  Act  (I  4  of
1947)(hereinafter called the Act).  That question arises  in
this  way.  On the 14th March, 1960, the Government of	West
Bengal	referred for adjudication to the  Fourth  Industrial
Tribunal  six  items of dispute between four  employers	 and
their  respective employees.  Amongst the employers was	 the
appellant  M/s.	  Serajuddin &	Co.,p-16,  Bentinck  Street,
Calcutta-1, and the items of dispute covered claims made  by
the employees for grade and scale, Dearness Allowance, House
rent,  leave and holidays, Provident Fund and Gratuity,	 and
condition  of  service.	  It appears that  all	the  workmen
employed  in  the  three  other	 industrial  concerns  filed
affidavits  before the Tribunal intimating to it  that	they
did  not want to proceed with the case because	the  dispute
between	 them  and  their  respective  employers  had	been
settled.  That is how the only dispute which was left before
the  Tribunal for its adjudication was the  dispute  between
the appellant and its workmen.
', On  behalf  of the appellant, a	 preliminary  objection	 was
raised	against the validity of the, reference	itself.	  It
was  urged  that under s.2(a),	the  appropriate  Government
which  could  make  a valid reference  in  relation  to	 the
present	  dispute  between  the	 parties  was  the   Central
Government  and not the State Govt. of West Bengal  and	 so,
the reference made by the latter Government was unauthorised
and   incompetent  and	the  Tribunal  bad,   therefore	  no
jurisdiction to deal with it.This
', 			    937', 
objection  has been over-ruled by the Tribunal and the	case
has been set down for hearing on the merits.  It is  against
this  finding that the appellant has come to this  Court  by
special leave and so the only point which has been raised by
Mr.  Sanyal  on behalf of the appellant is that	 the  appro-
priate	Government under',  s. 2(a)', u" 'is the Central  Government
and not the State Government of West Bengal.
Before dealing with this point, it is necessary to refer  to
the relevant and material facts in regard to the work  which
is carried on by the workmen at the appellant's office.	 The
appellant's office at Calcutta generally manages the work of
the  mines  and looks after the sale of its  mine  products.
The mining operations of the appellant are, however, carried
on  the State of Orissa under a lease executed in favour  of
the appellant by the said State.  These operations relate to
the  work  of chromite and manganese.  The function  of	 the
Calcutta  office is merely to exercise general control	over
the  mining  operations	 and  look after  the  sale  of	 the
minerals  produced in the said mines.  It appears  that	 the
staff  engaged	in  the	 Head  Office  at  Calcutta  can  be
transferred  to	 the office in Orissa where  the  mines	 are
situated.  For the purpose of exercising direct	 supervisory
control	 over the mining operations, the  appellant  employs
staff  at the site of the mines.  Mr. Sanyal  contends	that
the  Head  Office  of the appellant  at	 Calcutta  being  an
integral  part of the mine, any industrial  dispute  between
the  said Office and its employees is an industrial  dispute
concerning  a mine under",  s. 2(a)(i)', , and so the	 appropriate
Government must be the Central Government and not the  State
Government.
', Section 2(a)',  (i) provides, inter aila, that unless there  is
anything  repugnant in the subject or context,"	 appropriate
Government"  means  in	relation to  an	 industrial  dispute
concerning a mine the
', 938', 
Central	 Government.   The  question which  arises  for	 our
decision is whether the present dispute can he mid to be  an
industrial   dispute  concerning  a'  mine.   Mr.   Sanyal's
Argument  is  that  the word "industry" is  wide  enough  to
include the Head Office of a mining company, though it.	 may
be, situated away from the place where the mining operations
are actually carried on; and it is in the light of the	said
definition  of	the word.  "industry" contained in  a.	2(j)
that the words ",in relation, to a mine" must be  construed.
An  "industrial dispute" under',  s. 2(k)',  means inter alia	 any
dispute	 between  employers and workmen and  the  expression
"workman'  means any person employed in any industry  to  do
any  skilled  or unskilled work of. the	 type  described  by
', section	 2',  (a).	 Therefore, the words ,,industrial  dispute"
used in a. 2 a)(i) necessarily take us to the definition  of
the word ,industry" in',  s. 2(j)',  because an industrial dispute
takes us to the definition of the workman and the definition
of   a	 workman  inevitably  brings   in   the	  definition
of  .,industry" in a. 2(j).  That is how in  construing	 the
clause	"an industrial dispute concerning a mine" we  cannot
avoid brining in the wide definition of the word  "industry"
in a. 2 (j) and in the light of the said definition, a	mine
must mean the industry of mining and that would include	 the
Head  Office  which exercises general supervision  over	 the
mining operations of a company though it may be situated far
away   from  the  place'  where	 the  raid  operations	 are
conducted.  That, in brief, is the argument urged in support
of the appeal.
', on  the	 other	hand,  if  we  look  at	 the  definition  in
s.2(a)(i), it would be noticed that where it was intended to
refer  to an industry as such, the definition uses the	word
industry  as for instance, it refers to	 industrial  dispute
concerning only such controlled industry as may be specified
in  this  behalf  by  the  Central  Government,	 whereas  in
referring to the
', 			    939', 
dispute in regard to a mine the definition does not refer to
an  industrial dispute concerning a mining industry  but  it
merely says an industrial dispute concerning a mine.  In the
context,  a  mine  is referred to just as a  banking  or  an
insurance company is referred to or an oil-field or a  major
port  is referred.  Therefore, in construing the words	",an
industrial  dispute"  in relation to a mine, we	 must  first
deter. mine what a mine means and 'this must be done without
reference to the broad definition of industry prescribed  by
', section 2(j)', .
', In the absence of any definition of the word ",mine" in. the
Act,  we  may take into account the  dictionary	 meaning  as
excavation  in earth for metal, coal, salt etc.	  The  mines
Act ('I 5 of 1952) also contains a definition of "'mine"  in
s.  2(j).   The said definition shows, inter alia,  that,  a
"mine"	means  any excavation where any	 operation  for	 the
purpose	 of searching for or obtaining minerals has been  or
is being carried on.  It. is significant that the definition
of  mine under s.2(j) excludes an office of a mine which  is
separately  defined  by s.2(k) as meaning an office  at	 the
surface of the mine concerned so that there is no doubt that
the  office  of the mine, though it may be situated  at	 the
surface of the mine itself, is not within the definition  of
mine.	This position is further clarified when we  consider
the  definition	 of the person employed in a mine  which  is
prescribed by',  s. 2(h)', .	A person is said to be employed in a
mine who works under appointment by or with the knowledge of
the  manager,  whether	for  wages or  not,  in	 any  mining
operation,  or	in  cleaning  or  oiling  any  part  of	 any
machinery used in or about the mine, or in any other kind of
work  whatsoever  incidental to, or connected  with,  mining
operations.  It is obvious that the persons employed in	 the
Head Office wherever it may be situated cannot be said to do
the   mining  operation	 within	 the  first  part   of	 the
definition.   In  our opinion, they cannot be,	said  to  be
ordinarily
', 940', 
engaged in any other kind of work which is incidental to  or
connected with mining operations either.  The work which  is
incidental to or connected with mining operations must	have
some  connection with or relation to the  mining  operations
themselves.  The work that is carried on in the Head  Office
which  consists	 principally of the sale  operations  really
begins	after  the  minerals are ready	and  all  operations
incidental  to	or  connected  with  them  are	over.	This
position is not disputed.  Therefore, there can be no  doubt
that  under  the  ', Mines	 Act', , office  of  the  mine,  though
situated  at the surface of the mine, is not  necessarily  a
mine and the employees in the said office cannot necessarily
be  said  to  be  persons employed in a	 mine  and  so,	 the
regulatory provisions of the ', Mines Act',  would not necessarily
apply  to the office and would not govern the conditions  of
service of the employees in the said office.
It  is	in the light of the dictionary meaning of  the	word
"mine" or in the light of the definition of the word  'mine"
contained  in the ', Mines Act',  that we have to decide  what  an
industrial dispute concerning a mine means under  s.2(a)(i).
Judged	in that way, their can be no difficulty	 in  holding
that an industrial dispute between the employees engaged  in
the  Head  Office  at Calcutta and the employer	 is  not  an
industrial  dispute concerning a mine.	The lead  Office  is
not  a	mine  and so, an industrial dispute  raised  by	 the
employees  engaged in the Head Office is not  an  industrial
dispute concerning a mine.
', It  is,	 however,  urged  by Mr. Sanyal	 on  behalf  of	 the
appellant  that a mining lease under the Mines and  Minerals
(Regulation and ', Development) Act',  (53 of 1948) means a  lease
granted for the purpose of searching for, winning,  working,
getting	 making merchantable, carrying away or disposing  of
minerals  or for purposes connected therewith, and  includes
an  exploring or a prospecting license.	 ', This Act',   has	been
substantially amended in 1957.	But for
', 			    941', 
the  purpose of the argument urged on the definition of	 the
'mining	 lease" contained in s.(d), it is not  necessary  to
refer to the subsequent amendments made in the Act or in the
said definition itself.	 The argument is that a mining	case
contains a provision which enables the lessee to carry	away
or  dispose of the minerals and so, the process of  disposal
of  the minerals being covered by the mining lease  must  be
held  to be integrally connected with the mining  operations
and  since  sales of minerals are looked after in  the	Head
Office,	 the Head Office itself is a part of the  mine.	  In
our  opinion, there is no substance in this  argument.	 The
purpose	 of granting a mining lease obviously is  to  enable
the  lessee  to search for and win minerals and,  make	them
merchantable.  The said purpose must necessarily include the
right  of  the	lessee to carry away  the  minerals  and  to
dispose of them in the market.	But the rights conferred  on
the  lessee under a mining lease can have no direct  bearing
on the question of the construction of',  s. 2(a)', with which  we
are  concerned.	  As  we have already pointed  out,  in	 the
absence	 of  a	definition of the word ,,mine"	in  the	 Act
itself, we have to take either the dictionary meaning of the
word or the definition of the word "mine" in the ', Mines	Act', .
The rights conferred on the lessee in whose favour a  mining
lease  is executed can be of no assistance  in	interpreting
the  word  'mine"  in ', section 2(a)(i)', .	 Therefore,  we	 are
satisfied  that the Tribunal was right in holding  that	 the
present	 dispute between the appellant and its employees  at
its Head Office at Calcutta is not a dispute in relation  to
a mine.
', On  general  considerations  also,  the	 conclusion  of	 the
Tribunal appears to be right.  The Central Government  would
be  interested in industrial disputes in relation to a	mine
and  so, in regard to such disputes, the Central  Government
is made the appropriate Government by s.(2)(a). In this con-
nection, it would not be unreasonable to assume
', 942', 
that   the  Central  Government	 would	be   interested	  in
industrial  disputes  relating to mines as  defined  by	 the
mines  Act.   The relevant provisions of the mines  Act	 are
intended  to regulate labour in mines and as the  scheme  of
the Act shows, several provisions have been made by the	 Act
for  the  health and safety of the persons  working  in	 the
mines  and  provisions	have also been made  for  hours	 and
limitation  of employment in that-behalf.  If the scheme  of
the Act shows that office of the mine is outside the purview
of  the Act and the employees engaged in the  office  would,
therefore,   not  ordinarily  be  governed  by	 the   major
provisions of the Act, it would not be unreasonable to	hold
that  an  industrial dispute between such employees  of	 the
office	of  the mine and the employer is not  a	 dispute  in
which the Central Government would be interested.  It may be
that  some  of	the  work done in the  office  of  the	mine
situated at the surface of the mine may be incidental to  or
connected  with	 the mining operations,	 as,  e.g.,  keeping
muster	roll of workmen or payment register  maintained	 for
them.	Clerks engaged in such type of work may, be said  to
be  persons  employed in a mine; but the work  in  the	Head
Office	with which we are directly concerned in this  appeal
is   wholly   unconnected  with	 mining	  operations.	 All
industrial  disputes  which are outside a. 2(a)(i)  are	 the
concern	 of the State Government under ', section 2(a)(ii)', ;  in
other words, the general rule is that an industrial  dispute
&rising	 between  a  employer and  his	employees  would  be
referred  for indication by the State Government, except  in
cases falling under ', section 2(a)(i)', ; and so it is the extent
of  one of the exceptions mentioned in',  s. 2(a)',  (i)  that  we
have  to determine in the present case.	 In determining	 the
extent of the said exception, it would not be irrelevant  to
bear  in mind the scope of the provisions of the  ', Mines	 Act', 
itself.	 That it; why we think the fact that an office of  a
mine is outside the definition of a mine is of
',  943', 
some  assistance  in interpreting the  word  ",'mine"  under
', section 2(a)(i)', .
', We  must,  therefore, hold that the Tribunal  was  right  in
coming	to  the conclusion that the reference by  the  State
Government  of	West Bengal in the present case	 was  valid.
The appeal accordingly fails and is dismissed with costs.
Appeal dismissed.

HEADNOTE:
A dispute covering claims made by the employees was referred
for adjudication to the tribunal by the State Government of.
West  Bengal.  The appellant raised a preliminary  objection
against	 the validity of the reference and urged that  under
s. 2(a) the appropriate Government which could make a  valid
reference in relation to the present dispute was the Central
Government and not the Government of West Bengal and so, the
reference was unauthorised and incompetent and the  Tribunal
bad  no	 jurisdiction to deal with it.	The  Tribunal  over-
ruled this objection and the  case was set down for  hearing
on   the  merits.   Against  this  finding,  the   appellant
preferred  the present appeal by special leave and the	only
point  raised was that the head office of the  appellant  at
Calcutta being an integral part of the mine, any  industrial
dispute	 between  the said office and its  employees  is  an
industrial dispute-concerning a mine under',  s. 2(a)(i)',  and so
the  appropriate Government must be the	 Central  Government
and not the State Government.  The question for decision was
whether the present dispute can be said to be an  industrial
dispute	 concerning  a mine.  It was argued  that  the	word
"industry"  is wide enough to include the Head Office  of  a
mining company though, it may be situated away from the
 935
place  where the mining operations are actually	 carried  on
and  it is in the light of the said definition of  the	word
"industry" contained in',  s. 2(j)',  that the words "in  relation
to a mine" must be construed.
Held, that in construing the words-,,an industrial  dispute"
in  relation to a mine, it must first be determined  what  a
mine  means  and it must be done without  reference  to	 the
broad definition of industry prescribed by',  s. 2',  j).  In	 the
absence	 of  a	definition of the word "mine"  in  the(	 Act
itself, what has to be taken into account is the  dictionary
meaning	 of the word "mine" or as is contained in the  ', Mines
Act',  and judged in that light, there can be no difficulty  in
holding	 that  an industrial dispute between  the  employees
engaged	 in the Head Office at Calcutta and the employer  is
not  an	 industrial  dispute concerning a  mine.   The	Head
Office is not a mine and so, an industrial dispute raised by
the  employees	engaged.  in  the  head	 office	 is  not  an
industrial dispute concerning a mine.
The rights conferred on the lessee under a mining lease	 can
have  no direct bearing on the construction of',  s.  2(a)', 	 and
therefore,  the	 tribunal rightly. held,  that	the  present
dispute between the appellant and its employees at its	Head
Office at Calcutta is not a dispute in relation to a mine.
Held, further that all industrial disputes which are outside
s. 2(a)(i) are _the concern of the State Government under',  s.
2(a)(ii)', ;  in  other  words, the general  rule	is  that  an
industrial  dispute  arising  between  a  employer  and	 his
employees  would be referred for adjudication by  the  State
Government except in cases falling under',  s. 2(a)',  (i); and so
it  is	the extent of one of the exception mentioned  in ',  s.
2(a)(i)', 	 that has to be determined in the present case,	 and
in  determining the extent of the said exception,  it  would
not  be	 irrelevant  to	 bear  in  mind	 the  scope  of	 the
provisions  of the ', Mines Act',  itself.  That is why  the	fact
that an office of a mine is outside the definition of a mine
is of some assistance in interpreting the word "mine"  under
s.  2(a)(1) and therefore, the tribunal rightly came to	 the
conclusion  that  in the present case the reference  by	 the
State Government of West Bengal was valid.



JUDGMENT:
', CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION : Civil Appeal No. 355 of 1961.
Appeal by special leave from the order No. 28 dated  January
17, 1961, of the fourth Industrial Tribunal, West Bengal  in
Case No. VIII-71.
', 936', 
', P.K. Sanyal and D. N. Mukherjee, for the appellants.
Janardan Sharma, for the respondents.
', 1962.	March, 19.  The Judgment of the Court was  delivered
by
GAJENDREGADKAR,	 J.-This  appeal by special leave  raises  a
very  short  question about the construction of	 a  part  of
section	 2(a)  of  the	Industrial  Disputes  Act  (I  4  of
1947)(hereinafter called the Act).  That question arises  in
this  way.  On the 14th March, 1960, the Government of	West
Bengal	referred for adjudication to the  Fourth  Industrial
Tribunal  six  items of dispute between four  employers	 and
their  respective employees.  Amongst the employers was	 the
appellant  M/s.	  Serajuddin &	Co.,p-16,  Bentinck  Street,
Calcutta-1, and the items of dispute covered claims made  by
the employees for grade and scale, Dearness Allowance, House
rent,  leave and holidays, Provident Fund and Gratuity,	 and
condition  of  service.	  It appears that  all	the  workmen
employed  in  the  three  other	 industrial  concerns  filed
affidavits  before the Tribunal intimating to it  that	they
did  not want to proceed with the case because	the  dispute
between	 them  and  their  respective  employers  had	been
settled.  That is how the only dispute which was left before
the  Tribunal for its adjudication was the  dispute  between
the appellant and its workmen.
', On  behalf  of the appellant, a	 preliminary  objection	 was
raised	against the validity of the, reference	itself.	  It
was  urged  that under s.2(a),	the  appropriate  Government
which  could  make  a valid reference  in  relation  to	 the
present	  dispute  between  the	 parties  was  the   Central
Government  and not the State Govt. of West Bengal  and	 so,
the reference made by the latter Government was unauthorised
and   incompetent  and	the  Tribunal  bad,   therefore	  no
jurisdiction to deal with it.This
', 			    937', 
objection  has been over-ruled by the Tribunal and the	case
has been set down for hearing on the merits.  It is  against
this  finding that the appellant has come to this  Court  by
special leave and so the only point which has been raised by
Mr.  Sanyal  on behalf of the appellant is that	 the  appro-
priate	Government under',  s. 2(a)', u" 'is the Central  Government
and not the State Government of West Bengal.
Before dealing with this point, it is necessary to refer  to
the relevant and material facts in regard to the work  which
is carried on by the workmen at the appellant's office.	 The
appellant's office at Calcutta generally manages the work of
the  mines  and looks after the sale of its  mine  products.
The mining operations of the appellant are, however, carried
on  the State of Orissa under a lease executed in favour  of
the appellant by the said State.  These operations relate to
the  work  of chromite and manganese.  The function  of	 the
Calcutta  office is merely to exercise general control	over
the  mining  operations	 and  look after  the  sale  of	 the
minerals  produced in the said mines.  It appears  that	 the
staff  engaged	in  the	 Head  Office  at  Calcutta  can  be
transferred  to	 the office in Orissa where  the  mines	 are
situated.  For the purpose of exercising direct	 supervisory
control	 over the mining operations, the  appellant  employs
staff  at the site of the mines.  Mr. Sanyal  contends	that
the  Head  Office  of the appellant  at	 Calcutta  being  an
integral  part of the mine, any industrial  dispute  between
the  said Office and its employees is an industrial  dispute
concerning  a mine under",  s. 2(a)(i)', , and so the	 appropriate
Government must be the Central Government and not the  State
Government.
', Section 2(a)',  (i) provides, inter aila, that unless there  is
anything  repugnant in the subject or context,"	 appropriate
Government"  means  in	relation to  an	 industrial  dispute
concerning a mine the
', 938', 
Central	 Government.   The  question which  arises  for	 our
decision is whether the present dispute can he mid to be  an
industrial   dispute  concerning  a'  mine.   Mr.   Sanyal's
Argument  is  that  the word "industry" is  wide  enough  to
include the Head Office of a mining company, though it.	 may
be, situated away from the place where the mining operations
are actually carried on; and it is in the light of the	said
definition  of	the word.  "industry" contained in  a.	2(j)
that the words ",in relation, to a mine" must be  construed.
An  "industrial dispute" under',  s. 2(k)',  means inter alia	 any
dispute	 between  employers and workmen and  the  expression
"workman'  means any person employed in any industry  to  do
any  skilled  or unskilled work of. the	 type  described  by
', section	 2',  (a).	 Therefore, the words ,,industrial  dispute"
used in a. 2 a)(i) necessarily take us to the definition  of
the word ,industry" in',  s. 2(j)',  because an industrial dispute
takes us to the definition of the workman and the definition
of   a	 workman  inevitably  brings   in   the	  definition
of  .,industry" in a. 2(j).  That is how in  construing	 the
clause	"an industrial dispute concerning a mine" we  cannot
avoid brining in the wide definition of the word  "industry"
in a. 2 (j) and in the light of the said definition, a	mine
must mean the industry of mining and that would include	 the
Head  Office  which exercises general supervision  over	 the
mining operations of a company though it may be situated far
away   from  the  place'  where	 the  raid  operations	 are
conducted.  That, in brief, is the argument urged in support
of the appeal.
', on  the	 other	hand,  if  we  look  at	 the  definition  in
s.2(a)(i), it would be noticed that where it was intended to
refer  to an industry as such, the definition uses the	word
industry  as for instance, it refers to	 industrial  dispute
concerning only such controlled industry as may be specified
in  this  behalf  by  the  Central  Government,	 whereas  in
referring to the
', 			    939', 
dispute in regard to a mine the definition does not refer to
an  industrial dispute concerning a mining industry  but  it
merely says an industrial dispute concerning a mine.  In the
context,  a  mine  is referred to just as a  banking  or  an
insurance company is referred to or an oil-field or a  major
port  is referred.  Therefore, in construing the words	",an
industrial  dispute"  in relation to a mine, we	 must  first
deter. mine what a mine means and 'this must be done without
reference to the broad definition of industry prescribed  by
', section 2(j)', .
', In the absence of any definition of the word ",mine" in. the
Act,  we  may take into account the  dictionary	 meaning  as
excavation  in earth for metal, coal, salt etc.	  The  mines
Act ('I 5 of 1952) also contains a definition of "'mine"  in
s.  2(j).   The said definition shows, inter alia,  that,  a
"mine"	means  any excavation where any	 operation  for	 the
purpose	 of searching for or obtaining minerals has been  or
is being carried on.  It. is significant that the definition
of  mine under s.2(j) excludes an office of a mine which  is
separately  defined  by s.2(k) as meaning an office  at	 the
surface of the mine concerned so that there is no doubt that
the  office  of the mine, though it may be situated  at	 the
surface of the mine itself, is not within the definition  of
mine.	This position is further clarified when we  consider
the  definition	 of the person employed in a mine  which  is
prescribed by',  s. 2(h)', .	A person is said to be employed in a
mine who works under appointment by or with the knowledge of
the  manager,  whether	for  wages or  not,  in	 any  mining
operation,  or	in  cleaning  or  oiling  any  part  of	 any
machinery used in or about the mine, or in any other kind of
work  whatsoever  incidental to, or connected  with,  mining
operations.  It is obvious that the persons employed in	 the
Head Office wherever it may be situated cannot be said to do
the   mining  operation	 within	 the  first  part   of	 the
definition.   In  our opinion, they cannot be,	said  to  be
ordinarily
', 940', 
engaged in any other kind of work which is incidental to  or
connected with mining operations either.  The work which  is
incidental to or connected with mining operations must	have
some  connection with or relation to the  mining  operations
themselves.  The work that is carried on in the Head  Office
which  consists	 principally of the sale  operations  really
begins	after  the  minerals are ready	and  all  operations
incidental  to	or  connected  with  them  are	over.	This
position is not disputed.  Therefore, there can be no  doubt
that  under  the  ', Mines	 Act', , office  of  the  mine,  though
situated  at the surface of the mine, is not  necessarily  a
mine and the employees in the said office cannot necessarily
be  said  to  be  persons employed in a	 mine  and  so,	 the
regulatory provisions of the ', Mines Act',  would not necessarily
apply  to the office and would not govern the conditions  of
service of the employees in the said office.
It  is	in the light of the dictionary meaning of  the	word
"mine" or in the light of the definition of the word  'mine"
contained  in the ', Mines Act',  that we have to decide  what  an
industrial dispute concerning a mine means under  s.2(a)(i).
Judged	in that way, their can be no difficulty	 in  holding
that an industrial dispute between the employees engaged  in
the  Head  Office  at Calcutta and the employer	 is  not  an
industrial  dispute concerning a mine.	The lead  Office  is
not  a	mine  and so, an industrial dispute  raised  by	 the
employees  engaged in the Head Office is not  an  industrial
dispute concerning a mine.
', It  is,	 however,  urged  by Mr. Sanyal	 on  behalf  of	 the
appellant  that a mining lease under the Mines and  Minerals
(Regulation and ', Development) Act',  (53 of 1948) means a  lease
granted for the purpose of searching for, winning,  working,
getting	 making merchantable, carrying away or disposing  of
minerals  or for purposes connected therewith, and  includes
an  exploring or a prospecting license.	 ', This Act',   has	been
substantially amended in 1957.	But for
', 			    941', 
the  purpose of the argument urged on the definition of	 the
'mining	 lease" contained in s.(d), it is not  necessary  to
refer to the subsequent amendments made in the Act or in the
said definition itself.	 The argument is that a mining	case
contains a provision which enables the lessee to carry	away
or  dispose of the minerals and so, the process of  disposal
of  the minerals being covered by the mining lease  must  be
held  to be integrally connected with the mining  operations
and  since  sales of minerals are looked after in  the	Head
Office,	 the Head Office itself is a part of the  mine.	  In
our  opinion, there is no substance in this  argument.	 The
purpose	 of granting a mining lease obviously is  to  enable
the  lessee  to search for and win minerals and,  make	them
merchantable.  The said purpose must necessarily include the
right  of  the	lessee to carry away  the  minerals  and  to
dispose of them in the market.	But the rights conferred  on
the  lessee under a mining lease can have no direct  bearing
on the question of the construction of',  s. 2(a)', with which  we
are  concerned.	  As  we have already pointed  out,  in	 the
absence	 of  a	definition of the word ,,mine"	in  the	 Act
itself, we have to take either the dictionary meaning of the
word or the definition of the word "mine" in the ', Mines	Act', .
The rights conferred on the lessee in whose favour a  mining
lease  is executed can be of no assistance  in	interpreting
the  word  'mine"  in ', section 2(a)(i)', .	 Therefore,  we	 are
satisfied  that the Tribunal was right in holding  that	 the
present	 dispute between the appellant and its employees  at
its Head Office at Calcutta is not a dispute in relation  to
a mine.
', On  general  considerations  also,  the	 conclusion  of	 the
Tribunal appears to be right.  The Central Government  would
be  interested in industrial disputes in relation to a	mine
and  so, in regard to such disputes, the Central  Government
is made the appropriate Government by s.(2)(a). In this con-
nection, it would not be unreasonable to assume
', 942', 
that   the  Central  Government	 would	be   interested	  in
industrial  disputes  relating to mines as  defined  by	 the
mines  Act.   The relevant provisions of the mines  Act	 are
intended  to regulate labour in mines and as the  scheme  of
the Act shows, several provisions have been made by the	 Act
for  the  health and safety of the persons  working  in	 the
mines  and  provisions	have also been made  for  hours	 and
limitation  of employment in that-behalf.  If the scheme  of
the Act shows that office of the mine is outside the purview
of  the Act and the employees engaged in the  office  would,
therefore,   not  ordinarily  be  governed  by	 the   major
provisions of the Act, it would not be unreasonable to	hold
that  an  industrial dispute between such employees  of	 the
office	of  the mine and the employer is not  a	 dispute  in
which the Central Government would be interested.  It may be
that  some  of	the  work done in the  office  of  the	mine
situated at the surface of the mine may be incidental to  or
connected  with	 the mining operations,	 as,  e.g.,  keeping
muster	roll of workmen or payment register  maintained	 for
them.	Clerks engaged in such type of work may, be said  to
be  persons  employed in a mine; but the work  in  the	Head
Office	with which we are directly concerned in this  appeal
is   wholly   unconnected  with	 mining	  operations.	 All
industrial  disputes  which are outside a. 2(a)(i)  are	 the
concern	 of the State Government under ', section 2(a)(ii)', ;  in
other words, the general rule is that an industrial  dispute
&rising	 between  a  employer and  his	employees  would  be
referred  for indication by the State Government, except  in
cases falling under ', section 2(a)(i)', ; and so it is the extent
of  one of the exceptions mentioned in',  s. 2(a)',  (i)  that  we
have  to determine in the present case.	 In determining	 the
extent of the said exception, it would not be irrelevant  to
bear  in mind the scope of the provisions of the  ', Mines	 Act', 
itself.	 That it; why we think the fact that an office of  a
mine is outside the definition of a mine is of
',  943', 
some  assistance  in interpreting the  word  ",'mine"  under
', section 2(a)(i)', .
', We  must,  therefore, hold that the Tribunal  was  right  in
coming	to  the conclusion that the reference by  the  State
Government  of	West Bengal in the present case	 was  valid.
The appeal accordingly fails and is dismissed with costs.
Appeal dismissed.
