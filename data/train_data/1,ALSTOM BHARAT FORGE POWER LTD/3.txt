        ', Alstom Bharat Forge Power Ltd. (ABFPL), the joint venture company between Alstom and Bharat Forge, has signed a contract worth approximately \u20ac 130 million (11365 MINR)[1] with NTPC Limited to supply two units of 660 MW supercritical turbine islands for the Tanda coal power plant, located in the state of Uttar Pradesh in India.', 
', u"ABFPL's scope of work involves engineering, manufacturing, testing, supply, erection and commissioning of the two 660 MW supercritical turbine islands and auxiliaries for the plant. The equipment for the project will be manufactured at ABFPL's new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility at Sanand in Gujarat, which will be commissioned starting October 2014. Set up over 120 acres of land this manufacturing facility will reach an annual capacity of 5000 MW and will be one of the largest integrated facilities for turbines, generators and auxiliaries manufacturing in the country.", 
', Alain Spohr, Managing Director, ABFPL said: "This is another breakthrough for the joint venture after the two orders of Solapur and Nabinagar. This project reinforces our leading position in the supercritical steam market. We have been able to combine the technology and manufacturing skills of both partners (Alstom and Bharat Forge Ltd) to deliver a world-class product for the Indian market".', 
', Supercritical plants use steam with very high temperatures and pressure, resulting in a much higher efficiency than conventional sub-critical coal fired plants; it burns much less coal and generates less emission for a given power output.',

        ', Alstom Bharat Forge Power Ltd. (ABFPL), the joint venture company between Alstom and Bharat Forge, has signed a contract worth approximately \u20ac 130 million (11365 MINR)[1] with NTPC Limited to supply two units of 660 MW supercritical turbine islands for the Tanda coal power plant, located in the state of Uttar Pradesh in India.', 
', u"ABFPL's scope of work involves engineering, manufacturing, testing, supply, erection and commissioning of the two 660 MW supercritical turbine islands and auxiliaries for the plant. The equipment for the project will be manufactured at ABFPL's new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility at Sanand in Gujarat, which will be commissioned starting October 2014. Set up over 120 acres of land this manufacturing facility will reach an annual capacity of 5000 MW and will be one of the largest integrated facilities for turbines, generators and auxiliaries manufacturing in the country.",
