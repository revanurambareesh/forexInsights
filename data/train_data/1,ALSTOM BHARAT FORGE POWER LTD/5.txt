        ', Alstom Bharat Forge Power Ltd. (ABFPL), the joint venture company between Alstom and Bharat Forge, has secured in India an order worth over \u20ac350 million (Rs. 2,251 crores). ABFPL will supply three units of 660 MW supercritical coal turbine islands to Nabinagar Power Generating Co. Pvt Ltd, a joint venture between NTPC and Bihar State Electricity Board in Nabinagar, located in the state of Bihar. Alstom\u2019s share of the contract amounts to around \u20ac185 million.', 
', ABFPL\u2019s scope of work includes engineering, manufacturing, supply, erection and commissioning of three 660 MW supercritical units. This order is part of the NTPC bulk tender for the supply of eleven 660 MW turbine generator islands. This award follows the \u20ac250 million order won by ABFPL in April 2012 for the supply of two 660 MW supercritical units to NTPC Limited\u2019s Solapur site in Maharashtra, India.', 
', Alstom\u2019s supercritical technology uses steam with very high temperatures and pressure, resulting in a much higher efficiency (above 40 per cent) than conventional sub-critical coal fired plants. This means that a supercritical unit burns much less coal, generating less emission per megawatt of power output. This meets India\u2019s needs to increase electricity production for their development whilst limiting CO2 emissions.', 
', \u201c', The Solapur and Nabinagar orders confirm our commitment to further expand on the local steam market in India. Thanks to its strong expertise, technology, product portfolio, Alstom, together with its JV partner Bharat Forge, is well positioned to address the power requirements of the fast growing country', ,\u201d commented, Andreas Lusch, Senior Vice President of Alstom\u2019s Steam business.',

        ', Alstom Bharat Forge Power Ltd. (ABFPL), the joint venture company between Alstom and Bharat Forge, has secured in India an order worth over \u20ac350 million (Rs. 2,251 crores). ABFPL will supply three units of 660 MW supercritical coal turbine islands to Nabinagar Power Generating Co. Pvt Ltd, a joint venture between NTPC and Bihar State Electricity Board in Nabinagar, located in the state of Bihar. Alstom\u2019s share of the contract amounts to around \u20ac185 million.', 
', ABFPL\u2019s scope of work includes engineering, manufacturing, supply, erection and commissioning of three 660 MW supercritical units. This order is part of the NTPC bulk tender for the supply of eleven 660 MW turbine generator islands. This award follows the \u20ac250 million order won by ABFPL in April 2012 for the supply of two 660 MW supercritical units to NTPC Limited\u2019s Solapur site in Maharashtra, India.', 
', Alstom\u2019s supercritical technology uses steam with very high temperatures and pressure, resulting in a much higher efficiency (above 40 per cent) than conventional sub-critical coal fired plants. This means that a supercritical unit burns much less coal, generating less emission per megawatt of power output. This meets India\u2019s needs to increase electricity production for their development whilst limiting CO2 emissions.', 
', \u201c', The Solapur and Nabinagar orders confirm our commitment to further expand on the local steam market in India. Thanks to its strong expertise, technology, product portfolio, Alstom, together with its JV partner Bharat Forge, is well positioned to address the power requirements of the fast growing country', ,\u201d commented, Andreas Lusch, Senior Vice President of Alstom\u2019s Steam business.',
