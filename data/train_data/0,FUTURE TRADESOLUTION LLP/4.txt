            ', The practice of law is undergoing a fundamental transformation in the way legal work is acquired and done. Change is a fact of life, and the velocity of change is driving the creation of faster, more agile law firms. In the future, legal work will be done differently, with different team members, and under different organizational structures.', 
', Work will be better managed, more collaborative, more transparent and more client-focused. The design of the law office in the future will need to address these rapidly changing influences which are fundamentally re-engineering how work is done. The law office of the future will be smaller, flexible, more collaborative, and technology enabled. It will look more like a business consulting firm than a law firm.', 
', Over the course of 10 or 20 years, a legal office will undergo countless changes. The real key is building flexibility into a workplace from the start \u2013 today \u2013 so that the legal workplace can easily adapt to, and support, the needs and workstyles of the firm in the future.',

', Great design changes the way people experience space and place. At Gensler we believe that workplace design can be one of the most highly effective tools to help improve the productivity of employees.', A well-designed workplace creates ways for people to work more efficiently and effectively. It also communicates the culture and values of an organization, helping to improve employee commitment.
', In an industry undergoing massive changes, such as the legal industry, firms must be fast, fluid and flexible. Law firm design should respond accordingly, enabling new ways of working while supporting both the individual and the team with information-rich and technology-enabled environments.',

We\u2019ve partnered with the ALA to create a 5,000 SF exhibit focusing on the changes within the practice of law and the steps firms are taking to respond to these changes.', 
The Legal Office of the Future exhibition will begin by posing questions to visitors about both the changes in the legal industry and its future.', Through two short films, we\u2019ll begin suggesting responses to these questions with responses falling into six key categories. By partnering with best-in-class technology and furniture companies, the exhibition will envision and bring to life the law firm of the future. Attendees may walk through a variety of actual work settings and technologies that demonstrate design responses to change within the legal industry.',

            ', The practice of law is undergoing a fundamental transformation in the way legal work is acquired and done. Change is a fact of life, and the velocity of change is driving the creation of faster, more agile law firms. In the future, legal work will be done differently, with different team members, and under different organizational structures.', 
', Work will be better managed, more collaborative, more transparent and more client-focused. The design of the law office in the future will need to address these rapidly changing influences which are fundamentally re-engineering how work is done. The law office of the future will be smaller, flexible, more collaborative, and technology enabled. It will look more like a business consulting firm than a law firm.', 
', Over the course of 10 or 20 years, a legal office will undergo countless changes. The real key is building flexibility into a workplace from the start \u2013 today \u2013 so that the legal workplace can easily adapt to, and support, the needs and workstyles of the firm in the future.',

', Great design changes the way people experience space and place. At Gensler we believe that workplace design can be one of the most highly effective tools to help improve the productivity of employees.', A well-designed workplace creates ways for people to work more efficiently and effectively. It also communicates the culture and values of an organization, helping to improve employee commitment.

We\u2019ve partnered with the ALA to create a 5,000 SF exhibit focusing on the changes within the practice of law and the steps firms are taking to respond to these changes.', 
The Legal Office of the Future exhibition will begin by posing questions to visitors about both the changes in the legal industry and its future.', Through two short films, we\u2019ll begin suggesting responses to these questions with responses falling into six key categories. By partnering with best-in-class technology and furniture companies, the exhibition will envision and bring to life the law firm of the future. Attendees may walk through a variety of actual work settings and technologies that demonstrate design responses to change within the legal industry.',
