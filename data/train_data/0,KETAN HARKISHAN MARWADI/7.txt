', . During these exhibitions, special covers on a variety of subjects were also released. It is definitely a good philatelic activity at various places. But the time of the exhibitions is not suitable for school children as final exams are held in all schools of India during February - March months.

It has always been an interesting hobby. For encouraging this, the Indian Postal department had started Philatelic Bureaus. At present there are as many as 66 civilian and 2 CBPOs are working across the country to serve philatelists.', The main aim of  the bureaus is to provide philatelic items such as Indian stamps, first day covers, cancellations, souvenir sheets, souvenirs, information brochures etc. to philatelists to help them and to promote this hobby. There is provision of opening of Philatelic Deposit Accounts at these bureaus which provide new issues of stamps and other required material to the account holders. To help this cause Indian Postal Authorities opened 6 philatelic bureaus long back in 1948 in major post offices such as Mumbai, Kolkata etc. followed by long list in the following years. ',  ', Of late, it is heard and read that as many as 13 nos. of new philatelic bureaus are being opened all over in India by India Post under their so called expansion and promotion policy. This opening of the bureaus will take the toll to 81.Certainly an appreciable figure and act to help philatelists in India.  ', But as far as I am concerned, I am not at all happy with this expansion program. Looking in to the present poor, unorganized and badly mis-managed working of most of the bureaus, I feel there is a need of contraction program. I really don\u2019t understand whether these philatelic bureaus are philatelic bureaus or postal counters which actually serve a handful of philatelists and rest to some selected non philatelists. I don\u2019t find real utility of the opening of new philatelic bureau when they fail to serve philatelists in true sense. One must understand these philatelic bureaus are meant to serve philatelists and philatelists only. For sale of stamps there are postal counters and windows in all post offices of all levels and are sold to general public whose interest is to purchase stamps solely for postage purpose where as in philatelic bureaus not only stamps but other postal and philatelic material of interest of philatelists is also sold mainly for collection purpose.  ', My above quote is justified when we seriously look in to the working of the existing bureaus all around and find :  ',  ',  ', Less staff and also lack of regular, trained and dedicated staff. Untrained persons fail to serve philatelists as they don\u2019t understand philatelic terms and requirements of the philatelists',  ',  ', Non availability of material is another big setback in the working of these bureaus. Stamps issued today are sometimes made available after many many days.',  ',  ', First Day cancellations are not provided in time and some times not provided at all',  ',  ', No information about stamp issue program',  ',  ', Non delivery of stamps to the account holders in time i.e. delayed service',  ',  ', Improper care and attention to the visiting members by the staff i.e. poor interaction with the visiting philatelists.',  ',  ', Staff overloaded and over burdened with other works in the bureau itself',  ',  ', Bureau a good purchase counter for the stamp dealers at the cost of non delivery of material to the members. Deptt may be happy for good sale but philatelists are disappointed for whom the bureaus are opened. ',  ',  ', At some place staff wishes to serve philatelic dealers and not the philatelists.',  ',  ', Quick shuffling of the staff also causes problems to the members',  ',  ', Improper set up of some of the bureaus',  ', We regularly read in various magazines and journals about malfunctioning of the bureaus A few examples are ;  ', 1. ', Our Experience & Fraudulent working of Dehradun Philatelic Burea,  ', Aug 19th, 2010 by ', IndianStampGhar.com',   ', 2.

Rainbow stamp Blog February 3, 2014 mentions non availability of Souvenir Sheet on Bi-centenary celebrations of Indian Museum issued on 2 February 2014 in Philatelic Bureaus  ', By writing this ,I don\u2019t mean that all the bureaus are working badly. There are certain bureaus which work very nicely and are model. We do hear about satisfactory services being provided by those . I feel instead of opening so many new , deptt should think about bettering the existing ones by providing trained, dedicated but regular staff, providing better equipments and giving proper communication to them to be fed to the members and by supplying sufficient materials and cancellations in time.  ', Well, as the bureaus are opening, while I congratulate India Post, I wish these serve philatelists in the desired way and not the stamp dealers or the investors.

', New Philatelic Book on Antarctica theme released..',    ',   ',  ',  ', A book titled "Indian Antarctic Expedition-Philatelist's Guide" by well known philatelist Sh. Abhai Mishra was released by Sh. RC Agarwal, Outstanding Scientist & Director DEAL in a glittering function, held at DEAL Officers Institute, Raipur Road, Dehradun. The function was attended by large gathering of scientists, philatelists and veterans of Indian Antarctic Expedition.',  ',  ',   ',  ',  ', The John E. du Pont \u201cBritish Guiana\u201d Collection to be sold by David Feldman S.A. on June 27, 2014',  ',  ',  ', John E. du Pont earned fame and notoriety for his position as a beneficiary of the Du Pont chemical company fortune and regrettably later in his life, for responsibility of the death of Olympic gold medal wrestler Dave Schultz in 1996, for which he was convicted and spent the last years of his life in prison. However, little is known about his fame and honours as a stamp collector!  ', John du Pont always had an interest in stamps and stamp collecting and formed several fine collections including those of Canada and its pre-dominion provinces such as New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, as well as Samoa, Falkland Islands and some Eastern European areas.  ', However, his greatest philatelic accomplishment was the building of a great collection of the old British Colony known as British Guiana; du Pont achieved no less than 5 Grand Prix Awards including a National, International and Grand Prix d\u2019Honneur at various international philatelic exhibitions which ranked him third in the all-time list of multiple Grand Prix winners in 2000.', However, his most coveted and treasured win was that Grand Prix for the British Guiana at the Ameripex International Exhibition in Chicago, 1986. Here he showed, along with the collection, the famous ONE CENT stamp of 1856 often credited as the most valuable stamp in the world \u2013 indeed du Pont had bought this stamp for a then world record price of $935,000 in 1980.',  ', Since his death in December 2010 many rumours hinted to the sale of the Collection and the famous One Cent stamp; these rumours are now confirmed by recent announcements by Sotheby\u2019s where it is thought that their offer of the One Cent on June 17 in New York, may well break down the barriers of the philatelic market and attract a buyer outside the philatelic world.  ', Today, the well-known stamp auction company of David Feldman announced that it has been selected to offer du Pont\u2019s Grand Prix Collection of British Guiana including over 200 individual items including great single rarities with mint, used and original covers, at its own auction ten days later in Geneva, Switzerland. The collection will be offered on June 27 in Geneva, Switzerland.  ', David Feldman',  is one of the world\u2019s leading philatelic auction houses and currently holds the records for having sold the most expensive single stamp (The Treskilling Yellow of Sweden for CHF 2,875,000 in 1996) and the most expensive philatelic item (The Mauritius Bordeaux Cover sold at CHF 6,123,500 in 1993), and numerous other records.

However, following advance publicity for the stamp...a number of historians have disputed the veracity of the image saying the man depicted is not Jack White."', u"Linn's",  reports at least one pane of 15 stamps has been offered for sale by a dealer in Ireland.',  ', Read More\u2026',   ', Rare stamp could bring millions at NYC auction',  ',  ',  ',  ', New York (AP) \u2014 It could be called \u2018\u2018The Little Stamp That Could.\u2019\u2019 Three times in its long history, the 1-cent postage stamp from a 19th century British colony in South America has broken the auction record for a single stamp. Now, it\u2019s poised to become the world\u2019s most valuable stamp again.  ', Sotheby\u2019s predicts the 1856 British Guiana One-Cent Magenta will sell for between $10 million and $20 million when it\u2019s offered in New York on June 17.  ', \u2018\u2018You\u2019re not going to find anything rarer than this,\u2019\u2019 said Allen Kane, director of the Smithsonian National Postal Museum. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s a stamp the world of collectors has been dying to see for a long time.\u2019\u2019  ', Measuring 1 inch-by-1 1/4 inches, the feather-light One-Cent Magenta hasn\u2019t been on public view since 1986. It is the only major stamp absent from the British Royal Family\u2019s private Royal Philatelic Collection.  ', An 1855 Swedish stamp, which sold for $2.3 million in 1996, currently holds the auction record for a single.  ', \u2018\u2018This is the superstar of the stamp world,\u2019\u2019 said David Redden, Sotheby\u2019s worldwide chairman of books and manuscripts, adding that the stamp will travel to London and Hong Kong before being sold.  ', Printed in black on magenta paper, it bears the image of a three-masted ship and the colony\u2019s motto, in Latin, \u2018\u2018we give and expect in return.\u2019\u2019 The stamp went into circulation after a shipment of stamps was delayed from London and the postmaster asked printers for the Royal Gazette newspaper in Georgetown in British Guiana to produce three stamps until the shipment arrived: A 1-cent magenta, a 4-cent magenta and a 4-cent blue.  ', To safeguard against forgery, the postmaster ordered that the stamps be initialed by a post office employee.While multiple examples of the 4-cent stamps have survived, only the one tiny cent issue is known to exist today.  ', Its first owner was a 12-year-old Scottish boy living in South America who added it to his collection after finding it among family papers in 1873. He soon sold it for a few shillings to a local collector, Neil McKinnon, so he could afford to buy other stamps.  ', McKinnon kept it for five years before selling it to a Liverpool dealer who recognized the unassuming stamp as highly uncommon. He paid 120 pounds for it and quickly resold it for 150 pounds to Count Philippe la Renotiere von Ferrary, one of the world\u2019s greatest stamp collectors.  ', Upon his death in 1917, the count bequeathed his stamp collection to the Postmuseum in Berlin. The collection was later seized by France as war reparations and sold off in a series of 14 auctions with the One-Cent Magenta bringing $35,000 in 1922 \u2014 an auction record for a single stamp.  ', Arthur Hind, a textile magnate from Utica, N.Y., was the buyer. Among those bidding against him was King George V. It is the one major piece absent from the Royal Family\u2019s heirloom collection, Beech said.  ', Upon Hind\u2019s death in 1933, the stamp was put into an auction with the rest of his collection but was withdrawn after his widow, who claimed it was left to her, brought a lawsuit.  ', The next owner was Frederick Small, an Australian engineer living in Florida who purchased it privately from Hind\u2019s widow for $45,000 in 1940. Thirty years later, he consigned the stamp to a New York auction where it was purchased by an investment consortium for $280,000 \u2014 another record.  ', The stamp set its third record in 1980 when it sold for $935,000 to du Pont.Beech said likely buyers in June could be some of the world\u2019s biggest philatelic collectors, such as bond dealer Bill Gross, or a syndicate from anywhere in the world.

Madan Mohan Das, a veteran philatelist who passed away last month.',   ',  ', A doyen of Philately',   ', by G. Ram Mohan',   ',  ',  ', Madan Mohan Das',  ', It is not often that we have had among the citizens of Chennai someone who was nationally acclaimed as an authority in his chosen field of interest and who had often served as the \u2018National Commissioner for India\u2019 (something like the captain of an Indian team) at international competitions held in his field in capital cities abroad. One such rare person was Madan Mohan Das, the doyen of philately in Chennai. In his passing away last month at the age of 90, philatelists in Chennai have lost their leader, who had been a source of inspiration and guidance to them for the past 50 years.  ',   ', Image of 1854 Lithograph which Madan Bhai was an expert on.',   ', Philately (or \u2018stamp collection\u2019 in layman\u2019s terminology) has been often described as the \u2018king of hobbies and the hobby of kings\u2019. Madan Mohan Das, or \u2018Madan Bhai\u2019 as he was affectionately called by his admirers, was the uncrowned king of philately in Chennai. He was from a Gujarati business family, originally from Surat, that had settled in Tamil Nadu over three centuries ago. The family was initially based in Srirangam and was known for the gifts and endowments made by the family members to the Ranganathaswami temple there. Later, they shifted to Madras and settled in Sowcarpet. Madan Bhai\u2019s father was a prosperous shipping agent. As a boy he often went to the harbour with his father. There, in the dust bins in the offices and outside, he would see used postal envelopes from all over the world, with colourful stamps affixed on them. He started collecting them, and soon it became an all-absorbing hobby. Then, quite by accident, he came across a Varadaraja Chettiar, an enthusiastic philatelist from Nellikkuppam, who had been tutored in the intricacies of philately by an Englishman then employed in the Parry\u2019s Confectionary factory in Nellikkuppam. Chettiar would visit young Madan whenever he was in Madras and would often pay for and take the stamps collected by his young friend.  ', Madan Bhai graduated from St. Joseph\u2019s College, Trichy, and started his career in banking with the Indian Bank in Chennai in 1948. His job took him to Bombay in 1950 which was then, as now, the capital of philately in India. He made friends with the well-known philatelists of that era in Bombay, like J.N. Cooper, R.F. Shroff, R. Wadia and Dhirubhai Mehta. He learnt from them all the subtleties and refinements of \u2018philately\u2019 (as different from mere \u2018stamp collecting\u2019). He soon developed special thematic collections of his own.  ', He first developed an interest in collecting stamps known as \u2018Indian Classics\u2019 \u2013 a term used to describe early issues of stamps and rare stamps over 150 years old. It was, obviously, very difficult to come across material for such a collection. But Madan Bhai scoured the market with such vigour and enthusiasm that he soon had a sizeable collection of Classics.

It was initiated around the turn of the 20th century lead mostly by the educated middle class and ultimately was successful when 4th February, 1948 Ceylon was granted independence as the Dominion of Ceylon. Dominion status within the British Commonwealth was retained for the next 24 years until 22nd May, 1972 when it became a republic and was renamed the Republic of Sri Lanka.  ', Naur,  ',  ',   ', On 31st January 1968, Nauru (formerly Pleasant Island) declared independence. Nauru is the smallest republic in the world and is an island of just 8.1 sq mi in area.', Little is recorded about Nauru\u2019s history before British whaler Captain John Fearn came across it in 1798 on his way to China and named it Pleasant Island. Germany established sovereignty over Nauru in 1888 and in 1914 incorporated it into the German Marshall Islands. After World War I, Nauru became a League of Nations mandate administered by Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. During World War II, Nauru was occupied by Japanese troops, who were bypassed by the Allied advance across the Pacific. After the war ended, the country entered into trusteeship again.

According to historians, the English word \u201cromance\u201d was developed from a vernacular dialect within French language meaning \u201cverse narrative\u201d, referring to the style of speech and writing of the elite classes of Europe. Originally, the word was an adverb of the Latin Romanicus, meaning \u201cof the Roman style.\u201d  ', Other meanings developed over time, with a romantic tryst seen as adventurous and passionate. The modern meaning of romance is an expression of love or desire.  ', Croatia',   ',   ',  ', Hrvatska posta issued a stamp to celebrate XXII Olympic Winter Games in Sochi.',   ', First Winter Olympic Games were held at the foot of Mont Blanca, in the French village Chamonix, on 25 January 1924 with the participation of 240 sportsmen and 11 sportswomen from 16 countries. The gathering took place under the title: International Winter Sports Week; there were 10 sports and 16 disciplines.

', Slovenia',  : 31 January 2014',   ', Love stamp',   ',   ',  ', Even though an old Slovenian proverb says that the way to someone\u2019s heart is through their stomach, this relationship between two people is first and foremost a matter of the heart. This is also proven by a silver ring from the collection of the Slovenian Ethnographic Museum in Ljubljana formed by two hands holding a heart with a crown and featured on a new Slovenian stamp. The ring thus symbolizes the crown to a couple\u2019s love, which can denote engagement, wedding or merely an objectification of love between two partners. In Slovenia this way of displaying love and affection between the two sexes goes back to the seventeenth century when wedding rings began to be used.  ', Wearing rings for decoration and the custom of giving a ring to someone as a token of affection developed later on, in the second half of the nineteenth century. The Slovenian word prstan \u201cring\u201d itself also developed later than some other similar expressions such as rinka, rincica and rincca, which are all derived from the German word Ring \u201cring, circle\u201d.

', How about philately? That\u2019s right, stamp collecting.  ', The collection and study of postage and imprinted stamps dates to the late 1700s, when stamps were associated with the collecting of fiscal revenue \u2014 taxes. Collecting postage stamps took center stage in 1838 when the first prepaid postage stamps were issued for movement of letters/stationary and continued.  ', Worldwide interest in stamp collecting continued to grow, with the first stamp exhibition taking place in the 1870s, followed by the establishment of the American Philatelic Society on Sept. 13, 1886. Throughout the following decades, collections shifted to catalogs, postcards and pictorial stamps with all three of the variations taking center stage. Postal history and the study of postmarks begin to emerge as a serious collecting discipline in the 1910s with a major upward trend in stamp collecting taking off in the late 1940s and 1950s after World War II.  ', Today, people of all ages enjoy collecting stamps.

', . During these exhibitions, special covers on a variety of subjects were also released. It is definitely a good philatelic activity at various places. But the time of the exhibitions is not suitable for school children as final exams are held in all schools of India during February - March months. So many children are unable to visit these stamp shows. India Post should not organize such exhibitions at peak examination time but choose proper time for such shows.

It has always been an interesting hobby. For encouraging this, the Indian Postal department had started Philatelic Bureaus. At present there are as many as 66 civilian and 2 CBPOs are working across the country to serve philatelists.', The main aim of  the bureaus is to provide philatelic items such as Indian stamps, first day covers, cancellations, souvenir sheets, souvenirs, information brochures etc. to philatelists to help them and to promote this hobby. There is provision of opening of Philatelic Deposit Accounts at these bureaus which provide new issues of stamps and other required material to the account holders. To help this cause Indian Postal Authorities opened 6 philatelic bureaus long back in 1948 in major post offices such as Mumbai, Kolkata etc. followed by long list in the following years. ',  ', Of late, it is heard and read that as many as 13 nos. of new philatelic bureaus are being opened all over in India by India Post under their so called expansion and promotion policy. This opening of the bureaus will take the toll to 81.Certainly an appreciable figure and act to help philatelists in India.  ', But as far as I am concerned, I am not at all happy with this expansion program. Looking in to the present poor, unorganized and badly mis-managed working of most of the bureaus, I feel there is a need of contraction program. I really don\u2019t understand whether these philatelic bureaus are philatelic bureaus or postal counters which actually serve a handful of philatelists and rest to some selected non philatelists. I don\u2019t find real utility of the opening of new philatelic bureau when they fail to serve philatelists in true sense. One must understand these philatelic bureaus are meant to serve philatelists and philatelists only. For sale of stamps there are postal counters and windows in all post offices of all levels and are sold to general public whose interest is to purchase stamps solely for postage purpose where as in philatelic bureaus not only stamps but other postal and philatelic material of interest of philatelists is also sold mainly for collection purpose.  ', My above quote is justified when we seriously look in to the working of the existing bureaus all around and find :  ',  ',  ', Less staff and also lack of regular, trained and dedicated staff. Untrained persons fail to serve philatelists as they don\u2019t understand philatelic terms and requirements of the philatelists',  ',  ', Non availability of material is another big setback in the working of these bureaus. Stamps issued today are sometimes made available after many many days.',  ',  ', First Day cancellations are not provided in time and some times not provided at all',  ',  ', No information about stamp issue program',  ',  ', Non delivery of stamps to the account holders in time i.e. delayed service',  ',  ', Improper care and attention to the visiting members by the staff i.e. poor interaction with the visiting philatelists.',  ',  ', Staff overloaded and over burdened with other works in the bureau itself',  ',  ', Bureau a good purchase counter for the stamp dealers at the cost of non delivery of material to the members. Deptt may be happy for good sale but philatelists are disappointed for whom the bureaus are opened. ',  ',  ', At some place staff wishes to serve philatelic dealers and not the philatelists.',  ',  ', Quick shuffling of the staff also causes problems to the members',  ',  ', Improper set up of some of the bureaus',  ', We regularly read in various magazines and journals about malfunctioning of the bureaus A few examples are ;  ', 1. ', Our Experience & Fraudulent working of Dehradun Philatelic Burea,  ', Aug 19th, 2010 by ', IndianStampGhar.com',   ', 2. Truth of Delhi Philatelic Bureau Posted on ', February 12, 2014',  by ', PhilaMirror',   ', 3. Rainbow stamp Blog February 3, 2014 mentions non availability of Souvenir Sheet on Bi-centenary celebrations of Indian Museum issued on 2 February 2014 in Philatelic Bureaus  ', By writing this ,I don\u2019t mean that all the bureaus are working badly. There are certain bureaus which work very nicely and are model. We do hear about satisfactory services being provided by those . I feel instead of opening so many new , deptt should think about bettering the existing ones by providing trained, dedicated but regular staff, providing better equipments and giving proper communication to them to be fed to the members and by supplying sufficient materials and cancellations in time.  ', Well, as the bureaus are opening, while I congratulate India Post, I wish these serve philatelists in the desired way and not the stamp dealers or the investors.

', New Philatelic Book on Antarctica theme released..',    ',   ',  ',  ', A book titled "Indian Antarctic Expedition-Philatelist's Guide" by well known philatelist Sh. Abhai Mishra was released by Sh. RC Agarwal, Outstanding Scientist & Director DEAL in a glittering function, held at DEAL Officers Institute, Raipur Road, Dehradun. The function was attended by large gathering of scientists, philatelists and veterans of Indian Antarctic Expedition.',  ',  ',   ',  ',  ', The John E. du Pont \u201cBritish Guiana\u201d Collection to be sold by David Feldman S.A. on June 27, 2014',  ',  ',  ', John E. du Pont earned fame and notoriety for his position as a beneficiary of the Du Pont chemical company fortune and regrettably later in his life, for responsibility of the death of Olympic gold medal wrestler Dave Schultz in 1996, for which he was convicted and spent the last years of his life in prison. However, little is known about his fame and honours as a stamp collector!  ', John du Pont always had an interest in stamps and stamp collecting and formed several fine collections including those of Canada and its pre-dominion provinces such as New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, as well as Samoa, Falkland Islands and some Eastern European areas.  ', However, his greatest philatelic accomplishment was the building of a great collection of the old British Colony known as British Guiana; du Pont achieved no less than 5 Grand Prix Awards including a National, International and Grand Prix d\u2019Honneur at various international philatelic exhibitions which ranked him third in the all-time list of multiple Grand Prix winners in 2000.', However, his most coveted and treasured win was that Grand Prix for the British Guiana at the Ameripex International Exhibition in Chicago, 1986. Here he showed, along with the collection, the famous ONE CENT stamp of 1856 often credited as the most valuable stamp in the world \u2013 indeed du Pont had bought this stamp for a then world record price of $935,000 in 1980.',  ', Since his death in December 2010 many rumours hinted to the sale of the Collection and the famous One Cent stamp; these rumours are now confirmed by recent announcements by Sotheby\u2019s where it is thought that their offer of the One Cent on June 17 in New York, may well break down the barriers of the philatelic market and attract a buyer outside the philatelic world.  ', Today, the well-known stamp auction company of David Feldman announced that it has been selected to offer du Pont\u2019s Grand Prix Collection of British Guiana including over 200 individual items including great single rarities with mint, used and original covers, at its own auction ten days later in Geneva, Switzerland. The collection will be offered on June 27 in Geneva, Switzerland.  ', David Feldman',  is one of the world\u2019s leading philatelic auction houses and currently holds the records for having sold the most expensive single stamp (The Treskilling Yellow of Sweden for CHF 2,875,000 in 1996) and the most expensive philatelic item (The Mauritius Bordeaux Cover sold at CHF 6,123,500 in 1993), and numerous other records.

', \u2018\u2018You\u2019re not going to find anything rarer than this,\u2019\u2019 said Allen Kane, director of the Smithsonian National Postal Museum. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s a stamp the world of collectors has been dying to see for a long time.\u2019\u2019  ', Measuring 1 inch-by-1 1/4 inches, the feather-light One-Cent Magenta hasn\u2019t been on public view since 1986. It is the only major stamp absent from the British Royal Family\u2019s private Royal Philatelic Collection.  ', An 1855 Swedish stamp, which sold for $2.3 million in 1996, currently holds the auction record for a single.  ', \u2018\u2018This is the superstar of the stamp world,\u2019\u2019 said David Redden, Sotheby\u2019s worldwide chairman of books and manuscripts, adding that the stamp will travel to London and Hong Kong before being sold.  ', Printed in black on magenta paper, it bears the image of a three-masted ship and the colony\u2019s motto, in Latin, \u2018\u2018we give and expect in return.\u2019\u2019 The stamp went into circulation after a shipment of stamps was delayed from London and the postmaster asked printers for the Royal Gazette newspaper in Georgetown in British Guiana to produce three stamps until the shipment arrived: A 1-cent magenta, a 4-cent magenta and a 4-cent blue.  ', To safeguard against forgery, the postmaster ordered that the stamps be initialed by a post office employee.While multiple examples of the 4-cent stamps have survived, only the one tiny cent issue is known to exist today.  ', Its first owner was a 12-year-old Scottish boy living in South America who added it to his collection after finding it among family papers in 1873. He soon sold it for a few shillings to a local collector, Neil McKinnon, so he could afford to buy other stamps.  ', McKinnon kept it for five years before selling it to a Liverpool dealer who recognized the unassuming stamp as highly uncommon. He paid 120 pounds for it and quickly resold it for 150 pounds to Count Philippe la Renotiere von Ferrary, one of the world\u2019s greatest stamp collectors.  ', Upon his death in 1917, the count bequeathed his stamp collection to the Postmuseum in Berlin. The collection was later seized by France as war reparations and sold off in a series of 14 auctions with the One-Cent Magenta bringing $35,000 in 1922 \u2014 an auction record for a single stamp.  ', Arthur Hind, a textile magnate from Utica, N.Y., was the buyer. Among those bidding against him was King George V. It is the one major piece absent from the Royal Family\u2019s heirloom collection, Beech said.  ', Upon Hind\u2019s death in 1933, the stamp was put into an auction with the rest of his collection but was withdrawn after his widow, who claimed it was left to her, brought a lawsuit.  ', The next owner was Frederick Small, an Australian engineer living in Florida who purchased it privately from Hind\u2019s widow for $45,000 in 1940. Thirty years later, he consigned the stamp to a New York auction where it was purchased by an investment consortium for $280,000 \u2014 another record.  ', The stamp set its third record in 1980 when it sold for $935,000 to du Pont.Beech said likely buyers in June could be some of the world\u2019s biggest philatelic collectors, such as bond dealer Bill Gross, or a syndicate from anywhere in the world.

Madan Mohan Das, a veteran philatelist who passed away last month.',   ',  ', A doyen of Philately',   ', by G. Ram Mohan',   ',  ',  ', Madan Mohan Das',  ', It is not often that we have had among the citizens of Chennai someone who was nationally acclaimed as an authority in his chosen field of interest and who had often served as the \u2018National Commissioner for India\u2019 (something like the captain of an Indian team) at international competitions held in his field in capital cities abroad. One such rare person was Madan Mohan Das, the doyen of philately in Chennai. In his passing away last month at the age of 90, philatelists in Chennai have lost their leader, who had been a source of inspiration and guidance to them for the past 50 years.  ',   ', Image of 1854 Lithograph which Madan Bhai was an expert on.',   ', Philately (or \u2018stamp collection\u2019 in layman\u2019s terminology) has been often described as the \u2018king of hobbies and the hobby of kings\u2019. Madan Mohan Das, or \u2018Madan Bhai\u2019 as he was affectionately called by his admirers, was the uncrowned king of philately in Chennai. He was from a Gujarati business family, originally from Surat, that had settled in Tamil Nadu over three centuries ago. The family was initially based in Srirangam and was known for the gifts and endowments made by the family members to the Ranganathaswami temple there. Later, they shifted to Madras and settled in Sowcarpet. Madan Bhai\u2019s father was a prosperous shipping agent. As a boy he often went to the harbour with his father. There, in the dust bins in the offices and outside, he would see used postal envelopes from all over the world, with colourful stamps affixed on them. He started collecting them, and soon it became an all-absorbing hobby. Then, quite by accident, he came across a Varadaraja Chettiar, an enthusiastic philatelist from Nellikkuppam, who had been tutored in the intricacies of philately by an Englishman then employed in the Parry\u2019s Confectionary factory in Nellikkuppam. Chettiar would visit young Madan whenever he was in Madras and would often pay for and take the stamps collected by his young friend.  ', Madan Bhai graduated from St. Joseph\u2019s College, Trichy, and started his career in banking with the Indian Bank in Chennai in 1948. His job took him to Bombay in 1950 which was then, as now, the capital of philately in India. He made friends with the well-known philatelists of that era in Bombay, like J.N. Cooper, R.F. Shroff, R. Wadia and Dhirubhai Mehta. He learnt from them all the subtleties and refinements of \u2018philately\u2019 (as different from mere \u2018stamp collecting\u2019). He soon developed special thematic collections of his own.  ', He first developed an interest in collecting stamps known as \u2018Indian Classics\u2019 \u2013 a term used to describe early issues of stamps and rare stamps over 150 years old. It was, obviously, very difficult to come across material for such a collection. But Madan Bhai scoured the market with such vigour and enthusiasm that he soon had a sizeable collection of Classics.

It was initiated around the turn of the 20th century lead mostly by the educated middle class and ultimately was successful when 4th February, 1948 Ceylon was granted independence as the Dominion of Ceylon. Dominion status within the British Commonwealth was retained for the next 24 years until 22nd May, 1972 when it became a republic and was renamed the Republic of Sri Lanka.

Germany established sovereignty over Nauru in 1888 and in 1914 incorporated it into the German Marshall Islands. After World War I, Nauru became a League of Nations mandate administered by Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. During World War II, Nauru was occupied by Japanese troops, who were bypassed by the Allied advance across the Pacific. After the war ended, the country entered into trusteeship again.

', Slovenia',  : 31 January 2014',   ', Love stamp',   ',   ',  ', Even though an old Slovenian proverb says that the way to someone\u2019s heart is through their stomach, this relationship between two people is first and foremost a matter of the heart. This is also proven by a silver ring from the collection of the Slovenian Ethnographic Museum in Ljubljana formed by two hands holding a heart with a crown and featured on a new Slovenian stamp. The ring thus symbolizes the crown to a couple\u2019s love, which can denote engagement, wedding or merely an objectification of love between two partners. In Slovenia this way of displaying love and affection between the two sexes goes back to the seventeenth century when wedding rings began to be used.  ', Wearing rings for decoration and the custom of giving a ring to someone as a token of affection developed later on, in the second half of the nineteenth century. The Slovenian word prstan \u201cring\u201d itself also developed later than some other similar expressions such as rinka, rincica and rincca, which are all derived from the German word Ring \u201cring, circle\u201d.

Tired of watching cat videos, reruns of your favorite shows and digging yourself out of the snow? If you think your creative side is being neglected, it\u2019s time to find something else to do.  ', How about philately? That\u2019s right, stamp collecting.  ', The collection and study of postage and imprinted stamps dates to the late 1700s, when stamps were associated with the collecting of fiscal revenue \u2014 taxes. Collecting postage stamps took center stage in 1838 when the first prepaid postage stamps were issued for movement of letters/stationary and continued.  ', Worldwide interest in stamp collecting continued to grow, with the first stamp exhibition taking place in the 1870s, followed by the establishment of the American Philatelic Society on Sept. 13, 1886. Throughout the following decades, collections shifted to catalogs, postcards and pictorial stamps with all three of the variations taking center stage.

As a collector of various collectibles, he has faced many difficulties in collecting, understanding and arranging the collection. At the same time he realized that the same may be happening to new collectors and they might be facing similar hurdles too. To overcome such situations and to encourage philatelists and hobbyists, he has made the attempt of designing this Website ', www.indianphilatelics.com',   ', Nowadays, in philatelic fraternity, focus on modern Indian philately has gathered grounds. It has carved out an important niche in the hearts of new philatelists and collectors. This has happened because in last few years India Post has issued varieties of stamps, se-tenants, Miniature sheets, Sheetlets, Presentation Packs, FDCs and many more philatelic items which have attracted the collectors not only in India but all over the world.  ', This site gives view of all such philatelic items from his window i.e. from his angle.

', Here, he has tried to present Official and Private FDCs and Folders from 1947 to 1964 i.e. from Anna Value to Naya Paisa Value. This is an early classic period during which creative philatelists and dealers have produced many colorful and meaningful Private Covers. Similarly, he has tried to narrow down the subject of FDCs and Folders without missing or losing its charm focusing more on FDCs and folders of Set of Stamps, Se-tenant Stamps and Miniature Sheets which form the total of about 450 till 2012. This subject of modern philately is a fascinating section which is capable to delight the collector\u2019s eyes with various sizes, color shades, cancellation marks, legends and creative designs which have a religious, cultural, historical, political and commercial overtone.

The effort is made in this section to put such creative masterpieces.  ', Another interesting facet is ', u"'Philatelist's Delight'", u". Just as Creative Philately gives pleasure to collectors in creating a historic masterpiece which is the creation of his imagination, Philatelist's Delight gives him a treasure which is the creation of the Postal Department. As such these items are postal products but are made unusual and uncommon because of the dimension given to them. They are the source of delight as they have the 'Midas Touch' of creative philatelist. It is so because they are found out by sharp eyes and formed by deep imagination mixed with untiring efforts of the passionate collector. They may be rare and may be...
