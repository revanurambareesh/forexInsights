', Statute', [', edit', ]', 
', From 1957 to 1992, the board was a non-statutory body with no direct academic control.

', Syllabi and teaching', [', edit', ]', 
', The board reviews and revises syllabi for technical education institutions. (This includes syllabi for students in courses at an undergraduate level).
