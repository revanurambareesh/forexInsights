		', Essar has a global portfolio of onshore and offshore oil and gas blocks, with about 35,000 sq km available for exploration. We have about 700,000 bpsd (barrels per stream day) of global crude-refining capacity (Vadinar+Stanlow). In marketing, the company operates a network of over 2,100 retail outlets across India, with another 2,800 under various stages of commissioning. 
', Global exploration portfolio', u"Essar's exploration and production business has 2.1 billion barrels of oil equivalent of reserves and resources. Of this, approximately 150 million barrels are 2P and 2C resources, 1 billion barrels are prospective resources and 1 billion barrels are unrisked, in-place resources.", Largest CBM player in India', We have CBM acreage of over 2,700 sq km in India, which gives us the largest CBM acreage in the country. Our CBM block in Raniganj is close to commercial production and has signed customer contracts with several companies. ', Large refining capacity', We have a 20MTPA refinery at Vadinar in Gujarat, which started commercial production on May 1, 2008. With state-of-the-art technology, it has the capability to produce petrol and diesel that meets the latest Euro IV and Euro V emission standards. ', The refinery produces LPG, Naphtha, light diesel oil, Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF) and kerosene. It has been designed to handle a diverse range of crude \u2014 from sweet to sour and light to heavy. It is supported by an end-to-end infrastructure setup, including SBM (Single Buoy Mooring), crude oil tanker facility, water intake facilities, a captive power plant, product jetty and dispatch facilities by both rail and road. ', u"We have made substantial investments in installing the most advanced equipment and units in our refinery. At 97m, the refinery's crude column is Asia's tallest and capable of enhanced separation of petroleum products. The DHDS reactor is also the largest in its category, capable of producing Euro V-compliant diesel. The refinery is, in fact, unique in its complexity and its ability to produce value-added products. All units have operated many notches over their rated capacities with the crude unit achieving over 14 million tonnes (300,000 bpsd) in the very first year of operation. This is a first for any refinery in India. In 2012, the refinery capacity was expanded to 20 million tonnes, with an increase in its complexity from 6.1 to 11.8 on the Nelson index, making it India's second largest single-location refinery and amongst the most complex globally.", To date, our Vadinar refinery has successfully processed more than 75 varieties of crude from across world, including some of the "toughest crudes". ', u"In 2011, Essar acquired the Stanlow Refinery from Shell, which is the second largest refinery in England. The Stanlow Refinery, with a capacity of 296,000 barrels per day, lies near to Liverpool in northwest England, on the south bank of the Manchester ship canal. It supplies approximately 15 per cent of the country's transport fuel requirements. ", Retail and Marketing', u"Essar Oil serves retail customers in India through a modern, countrywide network of over 2,100 operational retail outlets and about 2,800 more under various stages of commissioning. We were the first private Indian company to enter petro-products retailing, looking beyond urban markets and reaching out to consumers in India's heartland. ", Tie-ups with other Indian oil marketing companies gives Essar Oil access to the products and the right to use their terminals and facilities for placing and marketing our products. This gives the company pan-India presence with more than 30 supply locations.', We offer a wide range of products to bulk customers in the industrial and transport sectors. Essar Oil has product offtake and infrastructure sharing agreements with all the oil PSUs (the state-owned public sector units), namely Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL), Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) and Indian Oil Corporation (IOCL). We have received approvals to supply ATF to the Indian Armed Forces.',  For regulatory information ', click here',

		', Essar has a global portfolio of onshore and offshore oil and gas blocks, with about 35,000 sq km available for exploration. We have about 700,000 bpsd (barrels per stream day) of global crude-refining capacity (Vadinar+Stanlow). In marketing, the company operates a network of over 2,100 retail outlets across India, with another 2,800 under various stages of commissioning. 
', Global exploration portfolio', u"Essar's exploration and production business has 2.1 billion barrels of oil equivalent of reserves and resources. Of this, approximately 150 million barrels are 2P and 2C resources, 1 billion barrels are prospective resources and 1 billion barrels are unrisked, in-place resources.", Largest CBM player in India', We have CBM acreage of over 2,700 sq km in India, which gives us the largest CBM acreage in the country. Our CBM block in Raniganj is close to commercial production and has signed customer contracts with several companies. ', Large refining capacity', We have a 20MTPA refinery at Vadinar in Gujarat, which started commercial production on May 1, 2008. With state-of-the-art technology, it has the capability to produce petrol and diesel that meets the latest Euro IV and Euro V emission standards. ', The refinery produces LPG, Naphtha, light diesel oil, Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF) and kerosene. It has been designed to handle a diverse range of crude \u2014 from sweet to sour and light to heavy. It is supported by an end-to-end infrastructure setup, including SBM (Single Buoy Mooring), crude oil tanker facility, water intake facilities, a captive power plant, product jetty and dispatch facilities by both rail and road. ', u"We have made substantial investments in installing the most advanced equipment and units in our refinery. At 97m, the refinery's crude column is Asia's tallest and capable of enhanced separation of petroleum products. The DHDS reactor is also the largest in its category, capable of producing Euro V-compliant diesel. The refinery is, in fact, unique in its complexity and its ability to produce value-added products. All units have operated many notches over their rated capacities with the crude unit achieving over 14 million tonnes (300,000 bpsd) in the very first year of operation. This is a first for any refinery in India. In 2012, the refinery capacity was expanded to 20 million tonnes, with an increase in its complexity from 6.1 to 11.8 on the Nelson index, making it India's second largest single-location refinery and amongst the most complex globally.", To date, our Vadinar refinery has successfully processed more than 75 varieties of crude from across world, including some of the "toughest crudes". ', u"In 2011, Essar acquired the Stanlow Refinery from Shell, which is the second largest refinery in England. The Stanlow Refinery, with a capacity of 296,000 barrels per day, lies near to Liverpool in northwest England, on the south bank of the Manchester ship canal. It supplies approximately 15 per cent of the country's transport fuel requirements. ", Retail and Marketing', u"Essar Oil serves retail customers in India through a modern, countrywide network of over 2,100 operational retail outlets and about 2,800 more under various stages of commissioning. We were the first private Indian company to enter petro-products retailing, looking beyond urban markets and reaching out to consumers in India's heartland. ", Tie-ups with other Indian oil marketing companies gives Essar Oil access to the products and the right to use their terminals and facilities for placing and marketing our products. This gives the company pan-India presence with more than 30 supply locations.', We offer a wide range of products to bulk customers in the industrial and transport sectors. Essar Oil has product offtake and infrastructure sharing agreements with all the oil PSUs (the state-owned public sector units), namely Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL), Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) and Indian Oil Corporation (IOCL). We have received approvals to supply ATF to the Indian Armed Forces.',  For regulatory information ', click here',
