Ours is a proud athletic tradition at HIES, where we set out each season to build winners on the field, and off it as well, emphasizing personal excellence, commitment, discipline, teamwork, leadership, and sportsmanship. At HIES, ours is a long list of regional and state championships. But even more, win or lose, we are building champions.
