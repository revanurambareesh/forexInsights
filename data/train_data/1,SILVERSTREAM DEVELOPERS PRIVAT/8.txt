We have always found their service to be very good and the staff easy to talk to and accommodating. The team was also very good at coming up with different ideas that we may not have thought of at the time.  The best part of the service we received was being set up with an online contact page where interested parties could submit their details such as their property requirements. This information was programmed to come through to our email and to also be automatically stored in our database. This gave us a great way to keep in touch with people and to be alerted to what they wanted. We would happily recommend Kaiser Creative Studio to others and would tell them about our database.\u201d',
