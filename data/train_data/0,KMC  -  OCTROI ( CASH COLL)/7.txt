          The SAD-BJP combine today sharpened its attack on the Congress by making the 1984 riots a central issue in Punjab.
', Addressing a series of rallies at Devigarh, Sanure, Dakala and Samana, the Union Law Minister, Mr Arun Jaitley, today focused on the riots and blamed the Congress leadership for the unrest.', He said the Congress had \u201chonoured\u201d those Congress leaders with ticket who were allegedly involved in the riots. Addressing a rally in support of Capt Kanwaljit Singh, SAD candidate from the Patiala constituency, he alleged that Congress leaders like Mr Jagdish Tytler and Mr Sajjan Kumar who had been accused of spearheading the riots by various independent probe panels, had been nominated as candidates from Delhi.', Mr R.K. Anand who had defended the Congress leaders in the riot cases, had also been nominated as candidate. The Congress had also \u201chonoured\u201d the judge who had headed the riots probe commission set up by the then Congress government at the Centre, by providing him a slot in the Rajya Sabha.', He claimed that there was a Vajpayee wave in the country and the NDA would improve its performance. ', He said Chief Minister Amarinder Singh had created Emergency-like situation in Punjab.', Former Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal also referred to the riots. Lashing out at Capt Amarinder Singh, he said the state had been ruined by him.', The benefits given by the previous SAD-BJP government in the form of old age pensions, shagun scheme, free power to farmers, and free canal water for irrigation had been withdrawn by the Amarinder Singh government, Mr Badal said.', Capt Kanwaljit Singh said the Congress was misleading people on the issue of Ghaggar and had done nothing to streamline the Ghaggar. \u201cThe Drainage Department had deployed machinery on the Ghaggar for a few hours at the instance of Mrs Preneet Kaur, Congress candidate for the Patiala constituency,  to give \u2018false hope\u2019 to the people of the area,\u201d he said.', Among others who spoke were Mr Ajaib Singh Makhmailpur and Mr Harmel Singh Tohra. Mr Prem Singh Chandumajra attended the rally at Dakala. The SAD claimed that several Congress activists joined the party today.',

          Apprehending incidents of violence and booth capture in some areas along the Haryana border, a special observer appointed by the Election Commission of India for', 
          the forthcoming Lok Sabha poll has asked the Punjab police to seal the border at Faridkot. Senior Punjab police officers have, however, expressed their inability', 
          citing "shortage of personnel" as the reason.
', Though the authorities are maintaining silence on the issue, sources at the Punjab Police headquarters reveal that the observer,  after assessing the situation, has asked the authorities concerned to completely seal the border along Muktsar and some other parts of Faridkot district. ', This, the observer has reportedly told the police authorities, would go a long way in preventing the entry of infiltrators in Punjab from across the border. The observer has also asked the authorities to declare Faridkot district "super sensitive". The total number of electors in the district is 12,63,201.  ', The sources added that the same observer has even asked the authorities in Uttar Pradesh to seal the border with Haryana.', They disclosed that the police authorities in Punjab have, on the other hand, reportedly informed the observer about the inadequate police force.', This, the authorities claimed, was due to rejection of their request by the Centre for deployment of additional forces for "maintaining the law and order situation" in
          the state. ', u"Punjab's Additional Director General of Police (Operations) Shashi Kant, in charge of the election cell set up
          by the Punjab police, was not
          available for comments despite repeated attempts. ", A senior police officer, on the condition of anonymity, however, added that "the problem was serious" as over 57,690 personnel were required for maintaining law and order in the state during the poll, besides providing security to the candidates and other election-related work. ', He claimed that the shortage of personnel was already forcing the police to go in for area security, instead of assigning individual duties.', The officer added that the authorities had also decided to divert personnel from different departments for plugging the gaps.', Giving details, he said the authorities were to go in for mass mobilisation of district police by gathering forces from numerous units, including the CID, intelligence, security, computers and even from training institutes. The officer disclosed that there were 15,651 polling booths in the entire state, including 3,520 sensitive stations. ', The Punjab police, it may be recalled, had initially requested the Centre to deploy 150 companies in the state during the poll. The request was, however, partly accepted by the Centre. The sources added that the Central Government agreed to deploy only 45 companies. Five companies, already stationed in the state, were taking care of
          VIP security.',

Release of letters on loan a poll

Chandigarh, April 26', 

          Shiromani Akali Dal president Parkash Singh Badal today dismissed as "churlish and an election stunt" the selective release of the correspondence on the special term loan waiver between the Government of India and the Punjab Government by the Chief Minister yesterday.
', Mr Badal said that the entire loan stood waived and "the people of Punjab and the country have it on record on the assurance of two successive Prime Ministers, Mr I.K. Gujral and Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee''. In addition, there was a communication with the state that Punjab did not have to repay the loan incurred on account of fighting insurgency. This communication was part of the record of the Punjab Vidhan Sabha. ', The Akali leader lambasted the Chief Minister for, what he termed, a "massive misinformation campaign". In fact, he should be the last person even to talk about the loan. The loan, just for record, was incurred by a Congress government in Punjab under Beant Singh with a Congress government at the Centre. Congress Prime Minister Narasimha Rao made a public commitment in Ludhiana in 1994 that he would waive this loan but went back on this as soon as he returned to New Delhi. The Beant Singh government even repaid two instalments. It was only when the Akalis came to power that Punjab refused to repay this loan and pressed for the waiver. ', "This is borne out even by the correspondence released by Capt Amarinder Singh. The correspondence clearly establishes that the SAD-BJP government and I as Chief Minister in particular staked everything on the loan being waived and finally succeeded in getting a Congress-inflicted injustice undone. In view of the role of the Congress in first incurring this loan and later failing to get it waived even from a Prime Minister belonging to its party." ',

          Mr S.K. Gupta, Chairman, local Improvement Trust, and a close associate of former President Giani Zail Singh, has criticised three senior political leaders, including Mr I.K. Gujral, former Prime Minister, Mr Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa, Union Minister for Chemicals and Fertiliser, a senior SAD leader and Mr Parkash Singh Badal, former state Chief Minister and SAD supremo, for misleading the people of the state on the issue of waiving of loans of Rs 8500 crore by Mr Gujral incurred by the state government during militancy days for security reason.
', By presenting documentary proofs in this connection in Chandigarh yesterday of a loan of Rs 3772 crore plus interest due for repayment by the Punjab Government till April 1 next year, Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh had not only brought the truth before the people but also exposed the motives of the three senior leaders to achieve political gains in different fields, Mr Gupta alleged. ', He alleged that Mr Gujral, Mr Dhindsa and Mr Badal had not only played a cruel joke with the sentiments of the people but also befooled over 104 crore people of the country.', Cautioning the electorate not to be misled by such politicians who had criminalised the politics for their personal interests.',  He also appealed them to cast their votes to the Congress which had always stood for strengthening democratic norms by following the secular ideals.', The Congress leader reminded them that even Dr A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, President, in his address last week also appealed to the countrymen to exercise their franchise with full care, rising above personal affiliation to strengthen the democratic roots in the country.',

Jalandhar, April 26', 

          Terming the BJP as an aimless party, a founder member of the RSS and the former Punjab BJP chief Mr Daya Singh Sodhi, today alleged that the BJP had dropped its original political agenda under pressure from its allies to remain in power. The BJP had failed to fulfil its promises on major issues like the construction of Ram Temple at Ayodhya, implementation of uniform civil code and Article 370 during its rule at the Centre. 
', Addressing a press conference here today, Mr Sodhi urged upon the RSS and the BJP workers to introspect their positions within the organisation keeping in view, the humiliation meted out to the former, which, ultimately forced him to resign from the primary membership of the party. ', Launching a fresh attack on the BJP, Mr Sodhi alleged that the BJP had lost its basic ideology and policy, which was evident from the fact that it chose to drop major political issues, including uniform civil code, construction of Ram temple at Ayodhya to appease its allies, who supported the BJP in forming government at the Centre.', Denying the allegations that he had left the party after being denied ticket from the Amritsar seat, Mr Sodhi said earlier, too, he was denied ticket from the Amritsar-North seat during 1992 Assembly elections, but he had not taken this extreme step at that time and remained a loyal party worker. ', \u201cIn fact, a Delhi-based senior RSS Adhikari, who was supporting Dr Baldev Raj Chawla for the allotment of party ticket from the Amritsar seat, was behind my exit from the party. He used offensive language when I simply asked for reasons to support Dr Chawla. It hurt me a lot that a junior rung RSS official openly humiliated me even though, I had put in 57 years of long service in RSS. This is an eye opener for the workers, who should go in for introspection to safeguard their future,\u201d Mr Sodhi said, adding that he would not pressurise his followers and collegues in the BJP to join the Congress. ', Getting emotional, Mr Sodhi said, \u201cI joined the RSS in 1942. It was very painful for me to write down the resignation. I kept on weeping for about half an hour after doing so.\u201d', When asked whether the Congress had assured him a better position in the party, he said that he had joined the Congress without pre-condition. \u201cBesides, the onus is on me to accept any post or not,\u201d he asserted. ', On the issue of foreign origin of the AICC President, Mr Sodhi said the BJP was adopting double standards on this issue. It honoured the Fiji President, Mr Mohinder Choudhary, for getting elected to the highest post of that country while on the other hand it was opposing Ms Sonia Gandhi, an Indian citizen, from holding the post of the Prime Minister.',

          Union Minister and Shiromani Akali Dal nominee for the Sangrur Lok Sabha constituency S.S. Dhindsa has demanded a judicial probe into the clash between activists of BKU (Ekta) and Congress workers at Minian village here. He also sought the deployment of paramilitary forces in the state for holding peaceful elections.
', Alleging that Congressmen had pre-planned the incident, he said \u201cthe police was helping the ruling party by not registering a case against its workers\u201d.', Mr Dhindsa, who had come to visit BKU leaders admitted to the local civil hospital, told reporters that \u201cBKU activists were only showing black flags to register their protest, that too outside the meeting venue. But the police at the instance of Congress leaders forcibly tried to remove the flags leading to the incident taking an ugly turn\u201d.', He strongly refuted the charge of state Congress chief H.S. Hanspal that the clash, which broke out during the election meeting of the Congress here a few days ago, was the handiwork of the Akalis. ', Superintendent of Police Harjit Singh Pannu, when contacted, said the police had registered a case against the guilty BKU and Congress workers and effected some arrests. \u2014

          As main Congress leaders of this Parliamentary constituency, including elected representatives and chairmen of different organisations of the state government, have not been taking part in the election campaign of the CPI-Congress candidate, Ms Kushal Bhora, the state CPI leadership has sent an SOS to its high command to tackle the situation.
', The state CPI leadership has also sent out a veiled threat that if the Congress rank and file does not participate in the election campaign of Ms Bhora at the earliest, CPI workers, who have been supporting Congress candidates in other Parliamentary constituencies, will also withdraw from the election campaign. ', Though the election campaign of the SAD-BJP candidate, Ms Paramjit Kaur, has started touching a feverish pitch. CPI leaders are finding it difficult to organise the campaign of Ms Bhora effectively due to the absence of key Congress leaders of Bathinda and Mansa districts, which are a part of the Bathinda Parliamentary constituency.', The CPI leaders, who have been camping in this area for the past two weeks, are facing this situation despite the fact that Ms Bhora started her election campaign much later than Ms Paramjit Kaur as her name was cleared by the respective party high commands very late.', CPI sources disclosed that the state leadership had earlier conveyed its displeasure to its high command over the fact that the Punjab Chief Minister, Capt Amarinder Singh, who was to accompany Ms Bhora when she filed her nomination papers on April 20, did not turn up despite the fact that a joint party rally had been organised for him in the city.', After that, it sent an SOS to member, Centre Secretariat, CPI, Mr Shamim Saize, and urged him to take up the matter with the Congress high command. ', Information gathered by The Tribune revealed that the local Congress MLA, Mr Surinder Singla, had made his appearance in the election campaign twice so far. First he visited the city and inaugurated the main election office of Ms Bhora and later on the day when she filed her nomination papers. ', Apart from this, several key Congress leaders, holding the post of chairman of different organisations in the state government, had been campaigning for Mrs Preneet Kaur and Mr Jagmeet Brar in Patiala and Ferozepore Parliamentary constituency, respectively.', \u201cIn absence of senior Congress leaders, junior party leaders have not been taking the elections seriously and hence Ms Bhora is finding it difficult to reach out to maximum number of people,\u201d pointed out a senior CPI leader on the condition of anonymity. He, however, claimed that Ms Bhora would win the elections easily as her husband, late Bhan Singh Bhora, had representated Bathinda twice in the Lok Sabha and done good work.',

          Congress candidate Preneet Kaur today countered the allegation levelled by SAD-BJP candidate Captain Kanwaljit Singh that the state government had failed to fill a single post in their two-year-old tenure by lashing out at the \u201ccorruption\u201d prevalent in the previous regime led by the SAD-BJP government. Claiming that 91 recruitments had been made by the Punjab Public Service Commission, she said, \u201cwe have kept our promise, jobs have not been auctioned to the highest bidder.\u201d
', Speaking at a political rally held in Sunam, Preneet Kaur said recruitments to various vacant posts in different departments were being made on the basis of merit alone. She claimed that it was ironic that the SAD-BJP government, which had failed the youth of the state, was harping upon this issue. She said it was the Congress which had taken action against PPSC Chairman Ravi Sidhu and revamped the commission and evolved transparency under which 91 appointments were made.', Accusing the SAD-led government of leaving the state exchequer empty, she said the Congress had to take harsh measures to bring the economy of the state back on track. Meanwhile, former MP and election in charge, Mr Sant Ram Singla, said all district leaders of the CPI, including Harpal Singh Ghagga and Sukhdev Singh
          Duggal, held a meeting with the Congress workers to chalk out a comprehensive campaign strategy for the forthcoming elections. Mr Singla said every voter of the constituency would be contacted under a mass contact programme. ',

          The All-India Sikh Students Federation (AISSF) president, Mr Harminder Singh Gill, joined the Congress here today. 
', Mr Gill made this announcement at the official residence of the Punjab Chief Minister, Capt Amarinder Singh, in the presence of the PPCC president, Mr
          H.S. Hanspal, who welcomed him.', u"Talking to media persons, Mr Gill said he had decided to take a ''U-turn'' as the traditional, panthic Shiromani Akali Dal had ''dissipated'' and instead there was just a political party run on the lines of a private limited company by Mr Parkash Singh Badal only to promote and protect political future of his family and son.", u"Mr Gill recalled his 20-year association with the Akali Dal, his siding with late Mr Gurcharan Singh Tohra, spending eight years in jail only to discover that the Akali Dal had totally changed. ''It is no longer follows the postulates of the
          'panth'. In fact, the soul of the panth has disappeared''.", u"To several questions, Mr Gill said the decision to quit as president of the AISSF and join the Congress was his own and he had not consulted other colleagues. A rally would be held at Patti in the Tarn Taran Lok Sabha constituency on May 2, which  the Chief Minister and Mr Hanspal would address. ''We will campaign for all Congress candidates, particularly in Tarn Taran and Amritsar.\u201d", Asked if he had forgotten and forgiven the Congress for Operation Bluestar at the Golden Temple in 1984, Mr Gill candidly said, \u201cIt was an unfortunate incident. I am a victim and aggrieved. But with the passage of time circumstances change and so have the Congress and the Akalis. In fact, the Akalis have done nothing for the rehabilitation of the victims of the anti-Sikh riots or reinstatement of the Sikh Army deserters.\u201d He, however, was uncertain if the Congress would heed his demands.', u"He appealed to the ''conscience'' of all those who felt suffocated in the Akali Dal to join the Congress. \u201cI find Capt Amarinder Singh a better Sikh than Mr Badal.\u201d",

          Mr Arvind Khanna, Congress nominee from the Sangrur Lok Sabha constituency, faced discord at the Congress  workers\u2019 meeting organised by the Barnala block Congress at the local Aggarwal Dharamshala yesterday.  
', The angry mood of Congress activists showed Mr Khanna\u2019s difficulties were far from over. Ironically, Mr Kewal Dhillon, Vice-President of the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee, who had come   from Chandigarh, failed to persuade his supporters to work for the success of Mr Khanna. ', Mr Chand Singh Chopra, former MLA belonging to the CPI(M), disgusted at the bickerings in the Congress, said the differences could be resolved later but the big challenge now was to defeat \u201ccommunal and fascist\u201d forces.',

          The statement of the sarpanch of Talhan village that the Dalit-dominated panchayat had extended its support to the Congress, has stunned the Dalit panches even as the Punjab Dalit Action Committee has decided to oppose the Congress, holding it responsible for the excesses against the Dalits.
', A visibly perturbed Ms Inderjit Kaur, sarpanch who had stated at a Congress rally in the village yesterday that the panchayat had decided to support the Congress, today tried to skirt the issue by saying that it was her own decision to support the Congress. She said she was not aware what the media had reported about her.', Her statement irked a large section of Dalits, particularly panches, who maintained that the panchayat had not taken such a decision.', Ms Ratni who had been elected panchayat member for the third consecutive time, said the panchayat had not taken any such decision. \u201cIt has surprised me. It can be her (Inderjit Kaur\u2019s) individual opinion and not that of the panchayat. We have not passed any resolution. We would see whom to cast our vote for,\u201d she said.', The Punjab Dalit Action Committee headed by Mr Sadhu Ram has criticised the statement of Ms Inderjit Kaur. \u201cWe see no reason to support the Congress. The sarpanch has no right to project that it was the decision of villagers. During our meeting, we have decided to oppose the Congress as we feel it had mishandled the situation due to which the Dalits were oppressed following the clashes in the villages,\u201d he said.',

          Bansa Ram of Kheri village near Patiala is waiting anxiously for an indication from the sant. So are followers of the sant spread across the entire Malwa belt of Punjab and part of Haryana and Rajasthan. \u201cSantji\u2019s  indication is  essential for me as well as the lakhs of his followers in the three northern states which are going to the polls\u201d, says Bansa.
', Sant Gurmeet Ram Raheem Singh of Dera Baba Sacha Sauda in Sirsa district of Haryana has become an institution that has a stranglehold over the votes of his followers, most of whom come from the backward strata of society. The god man, who is based in Sirsa, has created a virtual empire with the dera being a mini city with its own factories for making bread, biscuits, ice, soft drinks and ayurvedic medicines.', The administration of the dera is managed by a 10- member committee for each state which is  known as \u201cDus Numbri\u201d. ', The messages of the apex committee as well as the lower ones is conveyed to devotees through the sect\u2019s newspaper called \u201cSachh Kahun\u201d which is brought out and distributed by the devotees themselves. It has a circulation of around 1.5 lakh.', The Sachha Sauda Dera has a history of helping political parties as well as sometimes throwing its weight behind individual candidates. In the 1998 parliamentary elections, it was accused of siding with the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD). The party, however, cannot take this support for granted this time as Gurmeet Ram Raheem Singh has arranged the marriage of his son with the daughter of Congress leader Harminder Singh Jassi. The Congress leader, who had lost the last Assembly elections from Talwandi Sabo in Bathinda district, is at present Chairman of the cash-rich Markfed Corporation in Punjab.', Candidates standing for election from the Malwa belt of Punjab, including Patiala, Sangrur and Bathinda, have already been to the \u2018dera\u2019 to pay homage to the Baba as well as solicit the support of the \u2018dera\u2019 for their candidature. Congress Patiala candidate Preneet Kaur met Sant Gurmeet Ram Rahim at the dera\u2019s Sahlawatpura branch in Barnala district of Sangrur recently. Union Minister Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa, who is contesting from Sangrur, Capt Kanwaljit, who is contesting from Patiala, Congress candidate from Ferozepore Jagmeet Singh Brar and several politicians from Haryana, including its state BJP President Ganeshi Lal and Sirsa Congress candidate Atma Singh Gill have also met the sant recently.', However, the dera authorities maintain that they have nothing to do with politics. \u201cSantji has made this clear on a number of occasions\u201d, says dera press committee\u2019s senior member Gurbaz Singh. He says the dera has never asked its followers to vote for anyone but in case the devotees supported any one political party after holding meetings at the block level it was their own personal choice. ',

', Mr Jaitley said today that the Nehra Commission, set up by the Punjab Government to hold the inquiry, was not competent to do so because of legal and technical reasons. The entire exercise being done by
          the commission was meaningless as it had no legal sanction.', He said the inquiry in cases of transaction of currency in  foreign accounts could only be held by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) or by the Enforcement Department. No other agency except the CBI was competent to hold such inquiry, he added.', Questioning the logic of inquiry by the Nehra Commission, Mr Jaitley, asked if the commission had the power to check the accounts of any foreign company or any bank? or to seek embassy\u2019s help in conducting the inquiry. ', He said there was a  law that dealt with seeking information from foreign companies and banks regarding accounts, transaction of money. Under that law, proper procedure had to be followed for seeking the relevant information through proper channel from abroad, he added.', Mr Jaitley also confirmed that the  Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) was holding the inquiry into the alleged transactions of currency in a account of foreign company by Mr Raninder Singh, son of Punjab Chief Minister. \u201cI can\u2019t tell that the inquiry is at what stage I am aware that the inquiry was on\u201d,
          he added.', The former Punjab Chief Minister, Mr Parkash Singh Badal, had submitted a complaint regarding the alleged transaction of money by Mr Raninder Singh  to the Prime Minister, Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee, a few months ago. The complaint was referred to the DRI, which opened the inquiry, he added. ',

Paper leakage: clean chit to board

          The report of the fact finding committee constituted by the Punjab School Education Board (PSEB) to inquire into the paper leakage incident has given a clean chit to the board Chairman Dr Kehar Singh and the Controller of Examinations, Mrs Narinder Kaur. While stating that \u201cno board employee was involved in the shameful act of leaking question papers\u201d, the report has, however, repeatedly disparaged the role of the board\u2019s Secretary, Mr Mahinder Bir Singh, and the examination centre controllers in the matter. 
', The report has also recommended to the government that appointments to senior positions in the board be done on the basis of individual merit and should not be politically motivated. \u201cComplete coordination of effort at all levels is essential for the smooth functioning of the board. But it is obvious that there is lack of coordination among the senior functionaries. Maybe this is because of the presence of dissatisfied persons in the board,\u201d stated the report.', The report was recently placed before the members of the board and read out by the committee chairperson Dr Rita Bawa. It has given a detailed account of the manner in which a packet of Class X question papers had gone missing from one of the centres of examinations in Gurdaspur. This missing packet was initially considered to be the source of leakage of papers, but was later found in a sealed condition from one of the examination centres.', However, the committee members felt that the misplacing of the packet during distribution pointed towards gross negligence on the part of board employees. The report has, thus, squarely blamed two employees Tarsem Lal, a superintendent in the examination branch and a clerk Mahinder Pal, who were supervising the distribution of question papers in Gurdaspur for negligence of duty that caused \u201cthe board unprecendented embarrassment.\u201d ', Other than these two employees, the report has criticised the board Secretary for not understanding the seriousness of the problem and failing to coordinate properly with other senior officers. \u201cIt seems that there is both lack of coordination among the senior officers of the board and a tendency among them to wash their hands off their responsibilities,\u201d stated the report.', The report further points out that although the intentions of the board chairman, the deputy chairperson, the secretary and the controller cannot be questioned, yet there is lack of seriousness and cooperation among them \u201cwhich is extremely deplorable.\u201d ', Appreciating the efforts put in by the Controller of Examinations in ensuring that the examination results are declared in time, in the past years, the report stated that the system laid down for the conduct of examinations should have been strictly followed by all concerned. \u201cA large amount of embarrassment that the board had to face later, could have been avoided had the various persons involved in the conduct of examinations adhered strictly to their instructions,\u201d it stated.', The fact-finding committee comprising Ms Rita Bawa, Mr J.P. Sheor, Mr Avtar Singh and Mr G.S. Samra was formed on March 19 following leakage of Class X and XII question papers.',

It also ordered the CBI and the Punjab Government to return whatever material was lying with it expeditiously. 
', The order was passed after the Union Home Ministry filed an affidavit acknowledging that it is in possession of many articles, including books, paintings, rare documents, handwritten volumes of holy Sikh scriptures etc. ', The Union Government also expressed its wish to return the material. ', The Bench asked the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), which had earlier been impleaded as party to the case to approach the appropriate court to reclaim the material.', In his petition, Mr Satnam Singh had said that the material taken away from the Golden Temple during \u201cOperation Bluestar\u201d should be returned.', After being impleaded as party to the case, the SGPC had submitted a list of material, including cash, that was taken away from the Golden Temple. It had also said that despite repeated requests to top functionaries of the state, including President of India and Prime Minister, no effort was made to return the material, which is priceless part of Sikh history.', After going through the affidavit of the Union Home Ministry and being informed that the material can be returned, the Division Bench comprising Mr Chief Justice

The town has poor water supply, faulty sewerage, insanitary conditions, traffic jams and broken roads.', Encroachments have become a regular feature here. Go to any part of the town you will find people encoraching upon government land with  impunity. The authorities have not shown any inclination to tackle this problem.', Most shopkeepers on the bus stand road, Sirhindi Gate, Choota Chowk, bypass road and Kelon Gate display their commodities outside shops to woo customers.', Shopkeepers usually go much beyond their boundaries and leave little space for vehicles to pass through.', Some shopkeepers have put up permanent or temporary sheds in front of their shops. Any drive launched by the authorities does not sustain for long and things get back to square one.', There is no proper drainage system as a result some areas always stink because stagnant and muddy water. Stray animals can be seen throughout the day roaming in the market and on the Civil Hospital campus. The main bazaar and bus stand area always stink as heaps of garbage remain uncleared. The general bus stand in the Delhi Gate area is in bad shape.', Sanitary conditions are bad. Garbage is thrown everywhere. Passengers are forced to ease themselves in the open as the toilets remain dirty most of the time. There is no regular water supply in the toilets.', The local people, political leaders and social organisations have urged the Deputy Commissioner to take immediate action in this direction.',

          The SAD-BJP combine today sharpened its attack on the Congress by making the 1984 riots a central issue in Punjab.
', Addressing a series of rallies at Devigarh, Sanure, Dakala and Samana, the Union Law Minister, Mr Arun Jaitley, today focused on the riots and blamed the Congress leadership for the unrest.', He said the Congress had \u201chonoured\u201d those Congress leaders with ticket who were allegedly involved in the riots. Addressing a rally in support of Capt Kanwaljit Singh, SAD candidate from the Patiala constituency, he alleged that Congress leaders like Mr Jagdish Tytler and Mr Sajjan Kumar who had been accused of spearheading the riots by various independent probe panels, had been nominated as candidates from Delhi.', Mr R.K. Anand who had defended the Congress leaders in the riot cases, had also been nominated as candidate. The Congress had also \u201chonoured\u201d the judge who had headed the riots probe commission set up by the then Congress government at the Centre, by providing him a slot in the Rajya Sabha.', He claimed that there was a Vajpayee wave in the country and the NDA would improve its performance. ', He said Chief Minister Amarinder Singh had created Emergency-like situation in Punjab.', Former Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal also referred to the riots. Lashing out at Capt Amarinder Singh, he said the state had been ruined by him.', The benefits given by the previous SAD-BJP government in the form of old age pensions, shagun scheme, free power to farmers, and free canal water for irrigation had been withdrawn by the Amarinder Singh government, Mr Badal said.', Capt Kanwaljit Singh said the Congress was misleading people on the issue of Ghaggar and had done nothing to streamline the Ghaggar. \u201cThe Drainage Department had deployed machinery on the Ghaggar for a few hours at the instance of Mrs Preneet Kaur, Congress candidate for the Patiala constituency,  to give \u2018false hope\u2019 to the people of the area,\u201d he said.', Among others who spoke were Mr Ajaib Singh Makhmailpur and Mr Harmel Singh Tohra. Mr Prem Singh Chandumajra attended the rally at Dakala. The SAD claimed that several Congress activists joined the party today.',

          Apprehending incidents of violence and booth capture in some areas along the Haryana border, a special observer appointed by the Election Commission of India for', 
          the forthcoming Lok Sabha poll has asked the Punjab police to seal the border at Faridkot. Senior Punjab police officers have, however, expressed their inability', 
          citing "shortage of personnel" as the reason.
', Though the authorities are maintaining silence on the issue, sources at the Punjab Police headquarters reveal that the observer,  after assessing the situation, has asked the authorities concerned to completely seal the border along Muktsar and some other parts of Faridkot district. ', This, the observer has reportedly told the police authorities, would go a long way in preventing the entry of infiltrators in Punjab from across the border. The observer has also asked the authorities to declare Faridkot district "super sensitive". The total number of electors in the district is 12,63,201.  ', The sources added that the same observer has even asked the authorities in Uttar Pradesh to seal the border with Haryana.', They disclosed that the police authorities in Punjab have, on the other hand, reportedly informed the observer about the inadequate police force.', This, the authorities claimed, was due to rejection of their request by the Centre for deployment of additional forces for "maintaining the law and order situation" in
          the state. ', u"Punjab's Additional Director General of Police (Operations) Shashi Kant, in charge of the election cell set up
          by the Punjab police, was not
          available for comments despite repeated attempts. ", A senior police officer, on the condition of anonymity, however, added that "the problem was serious" as over 57,690 personnel were required for maintaining law and order in the state during the poll, besides providing security to the candidates and other election-related work. ', He claimed that the shortage of personnel was already forcing the police to go in for area security, instead of assigning individual duties.', The officer added that the authorities had also decided to divert personnel from different departments for plugging the gaps.', Giving details, he said the authorities were to go in for mass mobilisation of district police by gathering forces from numerous units, including the CID, intelligence, security, computers and even from training institutes. The officer disclosed that there were 15,651 polling booths in the entire state, including 3,520 sensitive stations. ', The Punjab police, it may be recalled, had initially requested the Centre to deploy 150 companies in the state during the poll. The request was, however, partly accepted by the Centre. The sources added that the Central Government agreed to deploy only 45 companies. Five companies, already stationed in the state, were taking care of
          VIP security.',

Release of letters on loan a poll
          stunt: Badal

Chandigarh, April 26', 

          Shiromani Akali Dal president Parkash Singh Badal today dismissed as "churlish and an election stunt" the selective release of the correspondence on the special term loan waiver between the Government of India and the Punjab Government by the Chief Minister yesterday.
', Mr Badal said that the entire loan stood waived and "the people of Punjab and the country have it on record on the assurance of two successive Prime Ministers, Mr I.K. Gujral and Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee''. In addition, there was a communication with the state that Punjab did not have to repay the loan incurred on account of fighting insurgency. This communication was part of the record of the Punjab Vidhan Sabha. ', The Akali leader lambasted the Chief Minister for, what he termed, a "massive misinformation campaign". In fact, he should be the last person even to talk about the loan. The loan, just for record, was incurred by a Congress government in Punjab under Beant Singh with a Congress government at the Centre. Congress Prime Minister Narasimha Rao made a public commitment in Ludhiana in 1994 that he would waive this loan but went back on this as soon as he returned to New Delhi. The Beant Singh government even repaid two instalments. It was only when the Akalis came to power that Punjab refused to repay this loan and pressed for the waiver. ', "This is borne out even by the correspondence released by Capt Amarinder Singh. The correspondence clearly establishes that the SAD-BJP government and I as Chief Minister in particular staked everything on the loan being waived and finally succeeded in getting a Congress-inflicted injustice undone. In view of the role of the Congress in first incurring this loan and later failing to get it waived even from a Prime Minister belonging to its party." ',

          Mr S.K. Gupta, Chairman, local Improvement Trust, and a close associate of former President Giani Zail Singh, has criticised three senior political leaders, including Mr I.K. Gujral, former Prime Minister, Mr Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa, Union Minister for Chemicals and Fertiliser, a senior SAD leader and Mr Parkash Singh Badal, former state Chief Minister and SAD supremo, for misleading the people of the state on the issue of waiving of loans of Rs 8500 crore by Mr Gujral incurred by the state government during militancy days for security reason.
', By presenting documentary proofs in this connection in Chandigarh yesterday of a loan of Rs 3772 crore plus interest due for repayment by the Punjab Government till April 1 next year, Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh had not only brought the truth before the people but also exposed the motives of the three senior leaders to achieve political gains in different fields, Mr Gupta alleged. ', He alleged that Mr Gujral, Mr Dhindsa and Mr Badal had not only played a cruel joke with the sentiments of the people but also befooled over 104 crore people of the country.', Cautioning the electorate not to be misled by such politicians who had criminalised the politics for their personal interests.',  He also appealed them to cast their votes to the Congress which had always stood for strengthening democratic norms by following the secular ideals.', The Congress leader reminded them that even Dr A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, President, in his address last week also appealed to the countrymen to exercise their franchise with full care, rising above personal affiliation to strengthen the democratic roots in the country.',

', Terming it as a setback to the Akali Dal, Mr Paramjit Singh Sarna, SAD (Delhi) president, talking to The Tribune on phone today said  that Gill was an  Akali of  strong  standing, but had been forced to join the congress.', Meanwhile, Rajinder Singh Mehta former president of the AISSF (Mehta) and SAD working committee member, alleged that Gill was always with the Congress.',

Jalandhar, April 26', 

          Terming the BJP as an aimless party, a founder member of the RSS and the former Punjab BJP chief Mr Daya Singh Sodhi, today alleged that the BJP had dropped its original political agenda under pressure from its allies to remain in power. The BJP had failed to fulfil its promises on major issues like the construction of Ram Temple at Ayodhya, implementation of uniform civil code and Article 370 during its rule at the Centre. 
', Addressing a press conference here today, Mr Sodhi urged upon the RSS and the BJP workers to introspect their positions within the organisation keeping in view, the humiliation meted out to the former, which, ultimately forced him to resign from the primary membership of the party. ', Launching a fresh attack on the BJP, Mr Sodhi alleged that the BJP had lost its basic ideology and policy, which was evident from the fact that it chose to drop major political issues, including uniform civil code, construction of Ram temple at Ayodhya to appease its allies, who supported the BJP in forming government at the Centre.', Denying the allegations that he had left the party after being denied ticket from the Amritsar seat, Mr Sodhi said earlier, too, he was denied ticket from the Amritsar-North seat during 1992 Assembly elections, but he had not taken this extreme step at that time and remained a loyal party worker. ', \u201cIn fact, a Delhi-based senior RSS Adhikari, who was supporting Dr Baldev Raj Chawla for the allotment of party ticket from the Amritsar seat, was behind my exit from the party. He used offensive language when I simply asked for reasons to support Dr Chawla. It hurt me a lot that a junior rung RSS official openly humiliated me even though, I had put in 57 years of long service in RSS. This is an eye opener for the workers, who should go in for introspection to safeguard their future,\u201d Mr Sodhi said, adding that he would not pressurise his followers and collegues in the BJP to join the Congress. ', Getting emotional, Mr Sodhi said, \u201cI joined the RSS in 1942. It was very painful for me to write down the resignation. I kept on weeping for about half an hour after doing so.\u201d', When asked whether the Congress had assured him a better position in the party, he said that he had joined the Congress without pre-condition. \u201cBesides, the onus is on me to accept any post or not,\u201d he asserted. ', On the issue of foreign origin of the AICC President, Mr Sodhi said the BJP was adopting double standards on this issue. It honoured the Fiji President, Mr Mohinder Choudhary, for getting elected to the highest post of that country while on the other hand it was opposing Ms Sonia Gandhi, an Indian citizen, from holding the post of the Prime Minister.',

Moga, April 26', 

          Union Minister and Shiromani Akali Dal nominee for the Sangrur Lok Sabha constituency S.S. Dhindsa has demanded a judicial probe into the clash between activists of BKU (Ekta) and Congress workers at Minian village here. He also sought the deployment of paramilitary forces in the state for holding peaceful elections.
', Alleging that Congressmen had pre-planned the incident, he said \u201cthe police was helping the ruling party by not registering a case against its workers\u201d.', Mr Dhindsa, who had come to visit BKU leaders admitted to the local civil hospital, told reporters that \u201cBKU activists were only showing black flags to register their protest, that too outside the meeting venue. But the police at the instance of Congress leaders forcibly tried to remove the flags leading to the incident taking an ugly turn\u201d.', He strongly refuted the charge of state Congress chief H.S. Hanspal that the clash, which broke out during the election meeting of the Congress here a few days ago, was the handiwork of the Akalis. ', Superintendent of Police Harjit Singh Pannu, when contacted, said the police had registered a case against the guilty BKU and Congress workers and effected some arrests. \u2014

          As main Congress leaders of this Parliamentary constituency, including elected representatives and chairmen of different organisations of the state government, have not been taking part in the election campaign of the CPI-Congress candidate, Ms Kushal Bhora, the state CPI leadership has sent an SOS to its high command to tackle the situation.
', The state CPI leadership has also sent out a veiled threat that if the Congress rank and file does not participate in the election campaign of Ms Bhora at the earliest, CPI workers, who have been supporting Congress candidates in other Parliamentary constituencies, will also withdraw from the election campaign. ', Though the election campaign of the SAD-BJP candidate, Ms Paramjit Kaur, has started touching a feverish pitch. CPI leaders are finding it difficult to organise the campaign of Ms Bhora effectively due to the absence of key Congress leaders of Bathinda and Mansa districts, which are a part of the Bathinda Parliamentary constituency.', The CPI leaders, who have been camping in this area for the past two weeks, are facing this situation despite the fact that Ms Bhora started her election campaign much later than Ms Paramjit Kaur as her name was cleared by the respective party high commands very late.', CPI sources disclosed that the state leadership had earlier conveyed its displeasure to its high command over the fact that the Punjab Chief Minister, Capt Amarinder Singh, who was to accompany Ms Bhora when she filed her nomination papers on April 20, did not turn up despite the fact that a joint party rally had been organised for him in the city.', After that, it sent an SOS to member, Centre Secretariat, CPI, Mr Shamim Saize, and urged him to take up the matter with the Congress high command. ', Information gathered by The Tribune revealed that the local Congress MLA, Mr Surinder Singla, had made his appearance in the election campaign twice so far. First he visited the city and inaugurated the main election office of Ms Bhora and later on the day when she filed her nomination papers. ', Apart from this, several key Congress leaders, holding the post of chairman of different organisations in the state government, had been campaigning for Mrs Preneet Kaur and Mr Jagmeet Brar in Patiala and Ferozepore Parliamentary constituency, respectively.', \u201cIn absence of senior Congress leaders, junior party leaders have not been taking the elections seriously and hence Ms Bhora is finding it difficult to reach out to maximum number of people,\u201d pointed out a senior CPI leader on the condition of anonymity. He, however, claimed that Ms Bhora would win the elections easily as her husband, late Bhan Singh Bhora, had representated Bathinda twice in the Lok Sabha and done good work.',

          Congress candidate Preneet Kaur today countered the allegation levelled by SAD-BJP candidate Captain Kanwaljit Singh that the state government had failed to fill a single post in their two-year-old tenure by lashing out at the \u201ccorruption\u201d prevalent in the previous regime led by the SAD-BJP government. Claiming that 91 recruitments had been made by the Punjab Public Service Commission, she said, \u201cwe have kept our promise, jobs have not been auctioned to the highest bidder.\u201d
', Speaking at a political rally held in Sunam, Preneet Kaur said recruitments to various vacant posts in different departments were being made on the basis of merit alone. She claimed that it was ironic that the SAD-BJP government, which had failed the youth of the state, was harping upon this issue. She said it was the Congress which had taken action against PPSC Chairman Ravi Sidhu and revamped the commission and evolved transparency under which 91 appointments were made.', Accusing the SAD-led government of leaving the state exchequer empty, she said the Congress had to take harsh measures to bring the economy of the state back on track. Meanwhile, former MP and election in charge, Mr Sant Ram Singla, said all district leaders of the CPI, including Harpal Singh Ghagga and Sukhdev Singh
          Duggal, held a meeting with the Congress workers to chalk out a comprehensive campaign strategy for the forthcoming elections. Mr Singla said every voter of the constituency would be contacted under a mass contact programme. ',

', Leaders of the Congress and the CPI, including Mr Ashok Kumar and Mr Jagjit Joga, said though Mr Parkash Singh Badal had been wooing urban voters by organising rallies in cities and towns, he had failed to tell people about anything that he had done for them during his tenure. ', They urged the people not to fall a prey to the promises being made by Mr Badal and his associates and vote for Ms Bhora as her husband, the late Bhan Singh Bhora, who had represented this constituency twice had done a lot for urban and rural areas.',

Chandigarh, April 26', 

          The All-India Sikh Students Federation (AISSF) president, Mr Harminder Singh Gill, joined the Congress here today. 
', Mr Gill made this announcement at the official residence of the Punjab Chief Minister, Capt Amarinder Singh, in the presence of the PPCC president, Mr
          H.S. Hanspal, who welcomed him.', u"Talking to media persons, Mr Gill said he had decided to take a ''U-turn'' as the traditional, panthic Shiromani Akali Dal had ''dissipated'' and instead there was just a political party run on the lines of a private limited company by Mr Parkash Singh Badal only to promote and protect political future of his family and son.", u"Mr Gill recalled his 20-year association with the Akali Dal, his siding with late Mr Gurcharan Singh Tohra, spending eight years in jail only to discover that the Akali Dal had totally changed. ''It is no longer follows the postulates of the
          'panth'. In fact, the soul of the panth has disappeared''.", u"To several questions, Mr Gill said the decision to quit as president of the AISSF and join the Congress was his own and he had not consulted other colleagues. A rally would be held at Patti in the Tarn Taran Lok Sabha constituency on May 2, which  the Chief Minister and Mr Hanspal would address. ''We will campaign for all Congress candidates, particularly in Tarn Taran and Amritsar.\u201d", Asked if he had forgotten and forgiven the Congress for Operation Bluestar at the Golden Temple in 1984, Mr Gill candidly said, \u201cIt was an unfortunate incident. I am a victim and aggrieved. But with the passage of time circumstances change and so have the Congress and the Akalis. In fact, the Akalis have done nothing for the rehabilitation of the victims of the anti-Sikh riots or reinstatement of the Sikh Army deserters.\u201d He, however, was uncertain if the Congress would heed his demands.', u"He appealed to the ''conscience'' of all those who felt suffocated in the Akali Dal to join the Congress. \u201cI find Capt Amarinder Singh a better Sikh than Mr Badal.\u201d",

', A visibly perturbed Ms Inderjit Kaur, sarpanch who had stated at a Congress rally in the village yesterday that the panchayat had decided to support the Congress, today tried to skirt the issue by saying that it was her own decision to support the Congress. She said she was not aware what the media had reported about her.', Her statement irked a large section of Dalits, particularly panches, who maintained that the panchayat had not taken such a decision.', Ms Ratni who had been elected panchayat member for the third consecutive time, said the panchayat had not taken any such decision. \u201cIt has surprised me. It can be her (Inderjit Kaur\u2019s) individual opinion and not that of the panchayat. We have not passed any resolution. We would see whom to cast our vote for,\u201d she said.', The Punjab Dalit Action Committee headed by Mr Sadhu Ram has criticised the statement of Ms Inderjit Kaur. \u201cWe see no reason to support the Congress. The sarpanch has no right to project that it was the decision of villagers. During our meeting, we have decided to oppose the Congress as we feel it had mishandled the situation due to which the Dalits were oppressed following the clashes in the villages,\u201d he said.',

The god man, who is based in Sirsa, has created a virtual empire with the dera being a mini city with its own factories for making bread, biscuits, ice, soft drinks and ayurvedic medicines.', The administration of the dera is managed by a 10- member committee for each state which is  known as \u201cDus Numbri\u201d. ', The messages of the apex committee as well as the lower ones is conveyed to devotees through the sect\u2019s newspaper called \u201cSachh Kahun\u201d which is brought out and distributed by the devotees themselves. It has a circulation of around 1.5 lakh.', The Sachha Sauda Dera has a history of helping political parties as well as sometimes throwing its weight behind individual candidates. In the 1998 parliamentary elections, it was accused of siding with the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD). The party, however, cannot take this support for granted this time as Gurmeet Ram Raheem Singh has arranged the marriage of his son with the daughter of Congress leader Harminder Singh Jassi. The Congress leader, who had lost the last Assembly elections from Talwandi Sabo in Bathinda district, is at present Chairman of the cash-rich Markfed Corporation in Punjab.', Candidates standing for election from the Malwa belt of Punjab, including Patiala, Sangrur and Bathinda, have already been to the \u2018dera\u2019 to pay homage to the Baba as well as solicit the support of the \u2018dera\u2019 for their candidature. Congress Patiala candidate Preneet Kaur met Sant Gurmeet Ram Rahim at the dera\u2019s Sahlawatpura branch in Barnala district of Sangrur recently. Union Minister Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa, who is contesting from Sangrur, Capt Kanwaljit, who is contesting from Patiala, Congress candidate from Ferozepore Jagmeet Singh Brar and several politicians from Haryana, including its state BJP President Ganeshi Lal and Sirsa Congress candidate Atma Singh Gill have also met the sant recently.', However, the dera authorities maintain that they have nothing to do with politics. \u201cSantji has made this clear on a number of occasions\u201d, says dera press committee\u2019s senior member Gurbaz Singh. He says the dera has never asked its followers to vote for anyone but in case the devotees supported any one political party after holding meetings at the block level it was their own personal choice. ',

Jaitley: DRI probing transactions by CM\u2019s son

          ', Tribune News Service', 
Patiala, April 26', 

          The Union Law Minister, Mr Arun Jaitley, here today gave a new twist to the ongoing controversy regarding the probe being conducted by the Nehra Commission into the alleged transactions of money in the account of a foreign company by Mr Raninder Singh, son of the Chief Minister, Capt Amarinder Singh.
', Mr Jaitley said today that the Nehra Commission, set up by the Punjab Government to hold the inquiry, was not competent to do so because of legal and technical reasons. The entire exercise being done by
          the commission was meaningless as it had no legal sanction.', He said the inquiry in cases of transaction of currency in  foreign accounts could only be held by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) or by the Enforcement Department. No other agency except the CBI was competent to hold such inquiry, he added.', Questioning the logic of inquiry by the Nehra Commission, Mr Jaitley, asked if the commission had the power to check the accounts of any foreign company or any bank? or to seek embassy\u2019s help in conducting the inquiry. ', He said there was a  law that dealt with seeking information from foreign companies and banks regarding accounts, transaction of money. Under that law, proper procedure had to be followed for seeking the relevant information through proper channel from abroad, he added.', Mr Jaitley also confirmed that the  Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) was holding the inquiry into the alleged transactions of currency in a account of foreign company by Mr Raninder Singh, son of Punjab Chief Minister. \u201cI can\u2019t tell that the inquiry is at what stage I am aware that the inquiry was on\u201d,
          he added.', The former Punjab Chief Minister, Mr Parkash Singh Badal, had submitted a complaint regarding the alleged transaction of money by Mr Raninder Singh  to the Prime Minister, Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee, a few months ago. The complaint was referred to the DRI, which opened the inquiry, he added. ',

Paper leakage: clean chit to board

          The report of the fact finding committee constituted by the Punjab School Education Board (PSEB) to inquire into the paper leakage incident has given a clean chit to the board Chairman Dr Kehar Singh and the Controller of Examinations, Mrs Narinder Kaur. While stating that \u201cno board employee was involved in the shameful act of leaking question papers\u201d, the report has, however, repeatedly disparaged the role of the board\u2019s Secretary, Mr Mahinder Bir Singh, and the examination centre controllers in the matter. 
', The report has also recommended to the government that appointments to senior positions in the board be done on the basis of individual merit and should not be politically motivated. \u201cComplete coordination of effort at all levels is essential for the smooth functioning of the board. But it is obvious that there is lack of coordination among the senior functionaries. Maybe this is because of the presence of dissatisfied persons in the board,\u201d stated the report.', The report was recently placed before the members of the board and read out by the committee chairperson Dr Rita Bawa. It has given a detailed account of the manner in which a packet of Class X question papers had gone missing from one of the centres of examinations in Gurdaspur. This missing packet was initially considered to be the source of leakage of papers, but was later found in a sealed condition from one of the examination centres.', However, the committee members felt that the misplacing of the packet during distribution pointed towards gross negligence on the part of board employees. The report has, thus, squarely blamed two employees Tarsem Lal, a superintendent in the examination branch and a clerk Mahinder Pal, who were supervising the distribution of question papers in Gurdaspur for negligence of duty that caused \u201cthe board unprecendented embarrassment.\u201d ', Other than these two employees, the report has criticised the board Secretary for not understanding the seriousness of the problem and failing to coordinate properly with other senior officers. \u201cIt seems that there is both lack of coordination among the senior officers of the board and a tendency among them to wash their hands off their responsibilities,\u201d stated the report.', The report further points out that although the intentions of the board chairman, the deputy chairperson, the secretary and the controller cannot be questioned, yet there is lack of seriousness and cooperation among them \u201cwhich is extremely deplorable.\u201d ', Appreciating the efforts put in by the Controller of Examinations in ensuring that the examination results are declared in time, in the past years, the report stated that the system laid down for the conduct of examinations should have been strictly followed by all concerned. \u201cA large amount of embarrassment that the board had to face later, could have been avoided had the various persons involved in the conduct of examinations adhered strictly to their instructions,\u201d it stated.', The fact-finding committee comprising Ms Rita Bawa, Mr J.P. Sheor, Mr Avtar Singh and Mr G.S. Samra was formed on March 19 following leakage of Class X and XII question papers.',

It also ordered the CBI and the Punjab Government to return whatever material was lying with it expeditiously. 
', The order was passed after the Union Home Ministry filed an affidavit acknowledging that it is in possession of many articles, including books, paintings, rare documents, handwritten volumes of holy Sikh scriptures etc. ', The Union Government also expressed its wish to return the material. ', The Bench asked the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), which had earlier been impleaded as party to the case to approach the appropriate court to reclaim the material.', In his petition, Mr Satnam Singh had said that the material taken away from the Golden Temple during \u201cOperation Bluestar\u201d should be returned.', After being impleaded as party to the case, the SGPC had submitted a list of material, including cash, that was taken away from the Golden Temple. It had also said that despite repeated requests to top functionaries of the state, including President of India and Prime Minister, no effort was made to return the material, which is priceless part of Sikh history.', After going through the affidavit of the Union Home Ministry and being informed that the material can be returned, the Division Bench comprising Mr Chief Justice
          B.K. Roy and Mr Justice Surya Kant disposed of the writ.',

', There has been a rapid growth of industrial units over the past 15 years. However, the civic amenities remain inadequate. The town has poor water supply, faulty sewerage, insanitary conditions, traffic jams and broken roads.', Encroachments have become a regular feature here. Go to any part of the town you will find people encoraching upon government land with  impunity. The authorities have not shown any inclination to tackle this problem.', Most shopkeepers on the bus stand road, Sirhindi Gate, Choota Chowk, bypass road and Kelon Gate display their commodities outside shops to woo customers.', Shopkeepers usually go much beyond their boundaries and leave little space for vehicles to pass through.', Some shopkeepers have put up permanent or temporary sheds in front of their shops. Any drive launched by the authorities does not sustain for long and things get back to square one.', There is no proper drainage system as a result some areas always stink because stagnant and muddy water. Stray animals can be seen throughout the day roaming in the market and on the Civil Hospital campus. The main bazaar and bus stand area always stink as heaps of garbage remain uncleared. The general bus stand in the Delhi Gate area is in bad shape.', Sanitary conditions are bad. Garbage is thrown everywhere. Passengers are forced to ease themselves in the open as the toilets remain dirty most of the time. There is no regular water supply in the toilets.', The local people, political leaders and social organisations have urged the Deputy Commissioner to take immediate action in this direction.',
