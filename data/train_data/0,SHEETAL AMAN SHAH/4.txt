She won the Miss Asia Pacific 1970 title. She is the first ", South Asian',  woman to win the title. Upon making her debut in Bollywood, Zeenat Aman, along with ', Parveen Babi', , was credited with making a lasting impact on the image of its leading actresses by introducing the modern look to Hindi cinema.', [1]', [2]', [3]',

', Early life', [', edit', ]', 
', Zeenat Aman was born in Mumbai (then called Bombay) in 1951 to Amanullah Khan.', [4]',  Her father, Amanullah Khan, was related to the ', Bhopal State',  ruling family. He was a script writer who made the script for such movies as ', Mughal-e-Azam',  and ', Pakeezah', u". Amanullah Khan often wrote under the nom de plume 'Aman' which she later adopted as her second name on screen. He died when Aman was 13. Her mother remarried a German man called Heinz (and was constantly referred to as Mrs. Heinz in all subsequent articles published in film magazines). Aman's mother obtained a German citizenship and took her to Germany where Zeenat Aman stayed temporarily. She returned to India when she turned 18. She is the cousin of actor ", Raza Murad',  and niece of actor ', Murad', .', 
', Aman did her schooling in Panchgani and went to ', University of Southern California',  in ', Los Angeles',  for further studies on student aid but she could not complete her graduation. Upon her return to India, she first took up a job as a journalist for ', Femina',  and then later on moved on to ', modeling', . One of the first few brands that she modeled for was Taj Mahal Tea in 1966. She was the second runner up in the ', Miss India',  Contest and went on to win the Miss Asia Pacific in 1970.', 
', Professional career', [', edit', ]', 
', After having studied in ', Los Angeles', u", winning the Miss Asia Pacific 1970 contest and a successful modeling career, Aman's film career began with a small role in ", u"O.P. Ralhan's",  ', Hulchul',  in 1971. A second role in ', Hungama',  (1971), starring singer ', Kishore Kumar',  where both films were not successful and she was ready to pack her bags to leave India and was ready to leave to ', Malta',  with her mother and step father.', 
', Dev Anand',  offered ', Zaheeda',  (his second heroine in ', Prem Pujari', ) the role of his sister in ', Hare Rama Hare Krishna',  (1971). Not realizing the importance of this secondary role, Zaheeda wanted the lead female part (eventually played by ', Mumtaz', ) and she opted out. Zeenat Aman was chosen as a last-minute replacement.', [2]', 
', In ', Hare Rama Hare Krishna', , Zeenat Aman, aided by ', R. D. Burman',  song ', Dum Maro Dum',  (Take Another Take), won over the hearts of audience as Janice. She earned a ', Filmfare Best Supporting Actress Award', [5]',  and ', BFJA Award',  for Best Actress.', [6]',  Throughout the 1970s, the ', Dev-Zeenat',  pairing was seen in half a dozen films: ', Heera Panna',  (1973), ', Ishq Ishq Ishq',  (1974), ', Prem Shastra',  (1974), ', Warrant',  (1975), ', Darling Darling',  (1977) and ', Kalabaaz',  (1977). Of these, ', Warrant', , was the biggest box-office success.', 
', Her hip looks in ', Yaadon Ki Baaraat',  (1973) as the girl carrying a guitar, singing ', Churaliya hai tumne jo dil ko',  (in ', Asha Bhosle', u"'s voice) has won her more popularity and the hearts of millions of fans.", [2]', 
', She appeared on every ', Hindi', u" film magazine's cover during the 1970s. In December 1974, ", Cine Blitz',  magazine was launched with Zeenat Aman on its cover,', [7]', u" a testimony to her popularity at the time. However, she went on as the favourite cover girl of the popular magazine '", Stardust', u"'.", 
', The 1970s', [', edit', ]', 
', Zeenat Aman, in her career and her success with ', Navketan Films',  and ', Dev Anand', , found success with other banners such as ', B.R. Chopra', , ', Raj Kapoor', , ', Manmohan Desai', , ', Feroz Khan', , ', Nasir Hussain', , ', Manoj Kumar', , ', Prakash Mehra', , ', Raj Khosla',  and ', Shakti Samanta', .', 
', In 1978, she starred in ', Raj Kapoor', u"'s massively publicised ", Satyam Shivam Sundaram',  (1978), however, the film was heavily criticized. The subject ironically dealt with the notion of the soul being more attractive than the body but ', Kapoor',  chose to showcase ', u"Aman's", u" sex-appeal. The actress was highly criticized for her exposure but somehow at later stage, the film had a great deal to do with Aman's fame and the movie itself was distinguished as a work of art. She also earned a ", Filmfare',  nomination as Best Actress for this film.', [2]', 
', u"Aman's entry into ", Hollywood',  also backfired when ', u"Krishna Shah's",  ', Shalimar',  (1978), co-starring ', Dharmendra',  and international names like ', Rex Harrison', , ', John Saxon',  and ', Sylvia Miles', , proved to be a failure in the United States and in India.', [2]',  Aman possessed a convent schoolgirl accent and a penchant for revealing dresses. She matched ', Gina Lollobrigida',  in the battle of oomph at ', u"Shalimar's",  launch. 1978 could have been a disaster year for her, because of the diminishing box office returns of ', Shalimar',  and discouraging critics riviews of ', Satyam Shivam Sundaram',  but Aman had other successful commercial films during that year such as ', Heeralal Pannalal',  and ', Chor Ke Ghar Chor', , yet it was ', Don',  that came to the rescue with its huge success. Ironically, her reasons for accepting the role in ', Don', u" were altruistic and she didn't even take any remuneration for it because she wanted to help the producer ", Nariman Irani',  who died midway filming.', [8]', u" Her role of a Westernized revenge-seeking action heroine contributed to the film's huge success and her fans reconnected with her again. Westernized heroines like ", Parveen Babi',  and ', Tina Munim',  now followed in her footsteps by the late 1970s. Aman continued to act in hits like ', Dharam Veer', , ', Chhaila Bab,  and ', The Great Gambler', .', 
', The 1980s', [', edit', ]', 
', By the beginning of the 1980s, multi-starrer films became a trend and Zeenat Aman was increasingly asked to just provide sex appeal in hero-oriented films, despite success in so many films. In contrast to this trend was her performance as a rape victim seeking justice in ', u"B. R. Chopra's",  ', Insaaf Ka Taraz,  (1980) for which she received a ', Filmfare',  Best Actress nomination. This film was followed by success in the love triangle ', Qurbani (1980 film)', , ', Alibaba Aur 40 Chor', , ', Dostana',  (1980) and ', Lawaaris',  (1981).', [2]', 
', u"Aman's popularity in Russia was so great after ", Alibaba Aur 40 Chor',  that she felt pressured into doing a supporting role in ', Sohni Mahiwal', . The film was moderately successful but no credit went to Aman.', [', citation needed', ]', 
', Her last role as the female lead was in the movie ', Gawahi', , a court room drama in 1989.', 
', The 1990s and 2000s', [', edit', ]', 
', Aman came back to the silver screen after a decade doing a cameo role in the film ', Bhopal Express',  (1999).', 
', The 2000s', [', edit', ]', 
', Aman went on to do roles in ', Boom',  (2003), ', u"Jaana... Let's Fall in Love",  (2006), ', Chaurahen',  (2007), ', Ugly Aur Pagli',  (2008), ', Geeta in Paradise',  (2009),', Dunno Y... Na Jaane Kyon',  (2010) and "', Strings of Passion', " (2012).', 
', In 2004, she appeared as ', Mrs. Robinson',  in the play ', The Graduate', u" staged at St Andrew's auditorium in ", Mumbai', . Zeenat Aman had a TV show called ', In Conversation with Zeenat',  made by B4U TV and also made an appearance along with ', Hema Malini',  in the popular show ', Koffee with Karan',  hosted by ', Karan Johar', .', 
', She received a Lifetime Achievement Award during the Zee Cine Awards function in 2008 as a recognition of her contribution to Hindi Cinema. She also received An Outstanding Contribution to Indian Cinema award at IIFA awards 2010 held at ', Colombo', , ', Sri Lanka', . She dedicated this award to her mother.', 
', Image', [', edit', ]', 
', u"Zeenat Aman's persona was a contrast to many of the more conservative stars of the era.", [2]',  At a time when heroines were obedient wives and lovers on the screens of Hindi Cinema, Aman was drawn to more unconventional roles\u2014she was cast as the opportunist who deserts her jobless lover for a millionaire (', Roti Kapda Aur Makaan', ), the ambitious girl who considers having an abortion in order to pursue a career (', Ajnabee', ), the happy hooker (', Manoranjan', ), the disenchanted ', hippie',  (', Hare Rama Hare Krishna', u"), the girl who falls in love with her mother's one-time lover ", (Prem Shastra', ) and a woman married to a caustic cripple but involved in an extramarital relationship (', Dhund', ). She managed to balance these roles with acting in more conventional films such as ', Chori Mera Kaam', , ', Chhaila Bab, , ', Dostana',  and ', Lawaaris', , which is considered by many to be a landmark in Indian Cinema. ', Encyclopædia Britannica', 's "Encyclopedia of Hindi Cinema" wrote, "Zeenat Aman had a definite impact on the characterization of the heroine in Hindi films. With films such as ', Hare Rama Hare Krishna',  and ', Yaadon Ki Baraat', , she fashioned the image of the youthful and westernized woman in Hindi cinema."', [1]', 
', u"Zeenat Aman's persona was such that newcomers were and still are compared to her. ", Parveen Babi',  was called "The poor man's Zeenat Aman", ', Sarika',  was christened "Zeenat Aman 2", ', Padmini Kolhapure',  was named "Baby Zeenat", and more recently, ', Bipasha Bas,  was referred to as the "new age Zeenat".', 
', Personal life', [', edit', ]', 
', In 1985, she married ', Mazhar Khan',  and had two sons Azaan and Zahaan. Mazhar Khan died in September 1998 of renal failure.', 
', Today, Zeenat Aman lives with her two sons and makes many social appearances and film awards functions.',

She won the Miss Asia Pacific 1970 title. She is the first ", South Asian',  woman to win the title. Upon making her debut in Bollywood, Zeenat Aman, along with ', Parveen Babi', , was credited with making a lasting impact on the image of its leading actresses by introducing the modern look to Hindi cinema.', [1]', [2]', [3]',

', Early life', [', edit', ]', 
', Zeenat Aman was born in Mumbai (then called Bombay) in 1951 to Amanullah Khan.', [4]',  Her father, Amanullah Khan, was related to the ', Bhopal State',  ruling family. He was a script writer who made the script for such movies as ', Mughal-e-Azam',  and ', Pakeezah', u". Amanullah Khan often wrote under the nom de plume 'Aman' which she later adopted as her second name on screen. He died when Aman was 13. Her mother remarried a German man called Heinz (and was constantly referred to as Mrs. Heinz in all subsequent articles published in film magazines). Aman's mother obtained a German citizenship and took her to Germany where Zeenat Aman stayed temporarily. She returned to India when she turned 18. She is the cousin of actor ", Raza Murad',  and niece of actor ', Murad', .', 
', Aman did her schooling in Panchgani and went to ', University of Southern California',  in ', Los Angeles',  for further studies on student aid but she could not complete her graduation. Upon her return to India, she first took up a job as a journalist for ', Femina',  and then later on moved on to ', modeling', . One of the first few brands that she modeled for was Taj Mahal Tea in 1966. She was the second runner up in the ', Miss India',  Contest and went on to win the Miss Asia Pacific in 1970.', 
', Professional career', [', edit', ]', 
', After having studied in ', Los Angeles', u", winning the Miss Asia Pacific 1970 contest and a successful modeling career, Aman's film career began with a small role in ", u"O.P. Ralhan's",  ', Hulchul',  in 1971. A second role in ', Hungama',  (1971), starring singer ', Kishore Kumar',  where both films were not successful and she was ready to pack her bags to leave India and was ready to leave to ', Malta',  with her mother and step father.', 
', Dev Anand',  offered ', Zaheeda',  (his second heroine in ', Prem Pujari', ) the role of his sister in ', Hare Rama Hare Krishna',  (1971). Not realizing the importance of this secondary role, Zaheeda wanted the lead female part (eventually played by ', Mumtaz', ) and she opted out. Zeenat Aman was chosen as a last-minute replacement.', [2]', 
', In ', Hare Rama Hare Krishna', , Zeenat Aman, aided by ', R. D. Burman',  song ', Dum Maro Dum',  (Take Another Take), won over the hearts of audience as Janice. She earned a ', Filmfare Best Supporting Actress Award', [5]',  and ', BFJA Award',  for Best Actress.', [6]',  Throughout the 1970s, the ', Dev-Zeenat',  pairing was seen in half a dozen films: ', Heera Panna',  (1973), ', Ishq Ishq Ishq',  (1974), ', Prem Shastra',  (1974), ', Warrant',  (1975), ', Darling Darling',  (1977) and ', Kalabaaz',  (1977). Of these, ', Warrant', , was the biggest box-office success.', 
', Her hip looks in ', Yaadon Ki Baaraat',  (1973) as the girl carrying a guitar, singing ', Churaliya hai tumne jo dil ko',  (in ', Asha Bhosle', u"'s voice) has won her more popularity and the hearts of millions of fans.", [2]', 
', She appeared on every ', Hindi', u" film magazine's cover during the 1970s. In December 1974, ", Cine Blitz',  magazine was launched with Zeenat Aman on its cover,', [7]', u" a testimony to her popularity at the time. However, she went on as the favourite cover girl of the popular magazine '", Stardust', u"'.", 
', The 1970s', [', edit', ]', 
', Zeenat Aman, in her career and her success with ', Navketan Films',  and ', Dev Anand', , found success with other banners such as ', B.R. Chopra', , ', Raj Kapoor', , ', Manmohan Desai', , ', Feroz Khan', , ', Nasir Hussain', , ', Manoj Kumar', , ', Prakash Mehra', , ', Raj Khosla',  and ', Shakti Samanta', .', 
', In 1978, she starred in ', Raj Kapoor', u"'s massively publicised ", Satyam Shivam Sundaram',  (1978), however, the film was heavily criticized. The subject ironically dealt with the notion of the soul being more attractive than the body but ', Kapoor',  chose to showcase ', u"Aman's", u" sex-appeal. The actress was highly criticized for her exposure but somehow at later stage, the film had a great deal to do with Aman's fame and the movie itself was distinguished as a work of art. She also earned a ", Filmfare',  nomination as Best Actress for this film.', [2]', 
', u"Aman's entry into ", Hollywood',  also backfired when ', u"Krishna Shah's",  ', Shalimar',  (1978), co-starring ', Dharmendra',  and international names like ', Rex Harrison', , ', John Saxon',  and ', Sylvia Miles', , proved to be a failure in the United States and in India.', [2]',  Aman possessed a convent schoolgirl accent and a penchant for revealing dresses. She matched ', Gina Lollobrigida',  in the battle of oomph at ', u"Shalimar's",  launch. 1978 could have been a disaster year for her, because of the diminishing box office returns of ', Shalimar',  and discouraging critics riviews of ', Satyam Shivam Sundaram',  but Aman had other successful commercial films during that year such as ', Heeralal Pannalal',  and ', Chor Ke Ghar Chor', , yet it was ', Don',  that came to the rescue with its huge success. Ironically, her reasons for accepting the role in ', Don', u" were altruistic and she didn't even take any remuneration for it because she wanted to help the producer ", Nariman Irani',  who died midway filming.', [8]', u" Her role of a Westernized revenge-seeking action heroine contributed to the film's huge success and her fans reconnected with her again. Westernized heroines like ", Parveen Babi',  and ', Tina Munim',  now followed in her footsteps by the late 1970s. Aman continued to act in hits like ', Dharam Veer', , ', Chhaila Bab,  and ', The Great Gambler', .', 
', The 1980s', [', edit', ]', 
', By the beginning of the 1980s, multi-starrer films became a trend and Zeenat Aman was increasingly asked to just provide sex appeal in hero-oriented films, despite success in so many films. In contrast to this trend was her performance as a rape victim seeking justice in ', u"B. R. Chopra's",  ', Insaaf Ka Taraz,  (1980) for which she received a ', Filmfare',  Best Actress nomination. This film was followed by success in the love triangle ', Qurbani (1980 film)', , ', Alibaba Aur 40 Chor', , ', Dostana',  (1980) and ', Lawaaris',  (1981).', [2]', 
', u"Aman's popularity in Russia was so great after ", Alibaba Aur 40 Chor',  that she felt pressured into doing a supporting role in ', Sohni Mahiwal', . The film was moderately successful but no credit went to Aman.', [', citation needed', ]', 
', Her last role as the female lead was in the movie ', Gawahi', , a court room drama in 1989.', 
', The 1990s and 2000s', [', edit', ]', 
', Aman came back to the silver screen after a decade doing a cameo role in the film ', Bhopal Express',  (1999).', 
', The 2000s', [', edit', ]', 
', Aman went on to do roles in ', Boom',  (2003), ', u"Jaana... Let's Fall in Love",  (2006), ', Chaurahen',  (2007), ', Ugly Aur Pagli',  (2008), ', Geeta in Paradise',  (2009),', Dunno Y... Na Jaane Kyon',  (2010) and "', Strings of Passion', " (2012).', 
', In 2004, she appeared as ', Mrs. Robinson',  in the play ', The Graduate', u" staged at St Andrew's auditorium in ", Mumbai', . Zeenat Aman had a TV show called ', In Conversation with Zeenat',  made by B4U TV and also made an appearance along with ', Hema Malini',  in the popular show ', Koffee with Karan',  hosted by ', Karan Johar', .', 
', She received a Lifetime Achievement Award during the Zee Cine Awards function in 2008 as a recognition of her contribution to Hindi Cinema. She also received An Outstanding Contribution to Indian Cinema award at IIFA awards 2010 held at ', Colombo', , ', Sri Lanka', . She dedicated this award to her mother.', 
', Image', [', edit', ]', 
', u"Zeenat Aman's persona was a contrast to many of the more conservative stars of the era.", [2]',  At a time when heroines were obedient wives and lovers on the screens of Hindi Cinema, Aman was drawn to more unconventional roles\u2014she was cast as the opportunist who deserts her jobless lover for a millionaire (', Roti Kapda Aur Makaan', ), the ambitious girl who considers having an abortion in order to pursue a career (', Ajnabee', ), the happy hooker (', Manoranjan', ), the disenchanted ', hippie',  (', Hare Rama Hare Krishna', u"), the girl who falls in love with her mother's one-time lover ", (Prem Shastra', ) and a woman married to a caustic cripple but involved in an extramarital relationship (', Dhund', ). She managed to balance these roles with acting in more conventional films such as ', Chori Mera Kaam', , ', Chhaila Bab, , ', Dostana',  and ', Lawaaris', , which is considered by many to be a landmark in Indian Cinema. ', Encyclopædia Britannica', 's "Encyclopedia of Hindi Cinema" wrote, "Zeenat Aman had a definite impact on the characterization of the heroine in Hindi films. With films such as ', Hare Rama Hare Krishna',  and ', Yaadon Ki Baraat', , she fashioned the image of the youthful and westernized woman in Hindi cinema."', [1]', 
', u"Zeenat Aman's persona was such that newcomers were and still are compared to her. ", Parveen Babi',  was called "The poor man's Zeenat Aman", ', Sarika',  was christened "Zeenat Aman 2", ', Padmini Kolhapure',  was named "Baby Zeenat", and more recently, ', Bipasha Bas,  was referred to as the "new age Zeenat".', 
', Personal life', [', edit', ]', 
', In 1985, she married ', Mazhar Khan',  and had two sons Azaan and Zahaan. Mazhar Khan died in September 1998 of renal failure.', 
', Today, Zeenat Aman lives with her two sons and makes many social appearances and film awards functions.',
