', During the 20', th',  century, Poland has been the part of some of the most significant episodes of European history: two World Wars, the Holocaust, Solidarity struggle against communism, transition back to capitalist democracy and European unification.

The course will engage with this history and artistic heritage from one of its prominent locations \u2013 Krakow. The second largest and arguably the most historic city in Poland it was its capital till the end of 16', th',  Century. This is where at the Wawel Royal Castle one finds the tombs of Polish kings and 20', th',  century dignitaries. Always intellectually vibrant, it was a major center of Christian and Jewish cultures and home to Jagiellonian University, second oldest in Central Europe.

Private dinner guests and lecturers will include a rabbi, a priest, a World War II survivor, a Solidarity activist, businessman, film maker, animation historian and avantgarde electronic musician. Eight contemporary feature films by prominent directors will be screened.

', Health and Safety', 
', Students on international programs should be aware that attitudes toward medical conditions, disabilities, and psychological conditions vary by culture and under the laws of the host countries. These differences impact the level of treatment and accommodation available abroad. Students should give serious consideration to their health and personal circumstances when accepting a place in a program and should consult with their physicians.', 
', While the benefits of international travel can be enormous, it is often associated with certain health and safety risks. Thankfully, a number of interventions exist to mitigate these risks including vaccines, use of certain medications, and specific behavior changes. Health concerns vary by the particular destination, time of year, the health of the individual, type of accommodations, length of stay and specific activities. Participants should be up to date on all their regular immunizations, ', check the CDC website for vaccinations and immunizations', . In addition, specific travel vaccines such as typhoid, yellow fever, or rabies vaccines may be indicated. Various types of medication may also be needed to prevent life-threatening malaria or altitude illness; or to treat traveler\u2019s diarrhea. Finally, students should learn and utilize insect precautions, food and water precautions, and general safety precautions. These can prevent illnesses such as dengue fever, schistosomiasis, HIV; or accidents such as those involving motor vehicles. In spite of all the precautions, occasionally students due become ill or sustain an injury while traveling. Thankfully, most of these are minor. However, it is critical students have a clear plan of care in case of an emergency on their trip. The travel clinic at the Vaden Health Center has produced an ', online travel health module',  that provides comprehensive strategies to help you stay safe and healthy while traveling.', 
', Students must review the ', Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website',  for complete information regarding the health concerns and vaccine recommendations specific to Poland. Students must also discuss with the on-campus Vaden Health Center Travel Clinic or a travel health specialist about the best ways to protect their health. It is strongly recommended that students make an appointment with the on-campus ', Vaden Health Center Travel Clinic',  as soon as getting accepted to the program at (650) 498-2336 ext. 1 to discuss any health concerns, pre-departure immunizations, and any personal prescriptions before going abroad.', 
', Students must review the ', U.S. State Department\u2019s consular information website',  for complete information on safety and security in Poland.', 
', As with any foreign travel, emphasis will be placed on staying away from questionable situations, avoiding injury, and preventing infectious disease. Students will be expected to travel in groups, avoid travel at night, and stay with the group unless prior approval is obtained.', 
', While overseas, students are advised to be alert to their surroundings, and be particularly aware of any health and safety advisories for the areas in which they will be visiting. Students should consult with their physicians to be prepared for potential illness. Additional issues of personal health and safety and precautions will be discussed in detail during the mandatory pre-seminar preparation and upon arriving in country.', 
', If you are uncomfortable traveling under such conditions, you should not apply to this seminar.', 
', Program Modification and Cancelation', 
', Stanford reserves the right to cancel or modify the seminar program before or during its operation for any reason, including natural disasters, emergencies, low enrollment, or unavailability of facilities or personnel or compliance with the University ', travel policy', .

', Health and Safety', 
', Students on international programs should be aware that attitudes toward medical conditions, disabilities, and psychological conditions vary by culture and under the laws of the host countries. These differences impact the level of treatment and accommodation available abroad. Students should give serious consideration to their health and personal circumstances when accepting a place in a program and should consult with their physicians.', 
', While the benefits of international travel can be enormous, it is often associated with certain health and safety risks. Thankfully, a number of interventions exist to mitigate these risks including vaccines, use of certain medications, and specific behavior changes. Health concerns vary by the particular destination, time of year, the health of the individual, type of accommodations, length of stay and specific activities. Participants should be up to date on all their regular immunizations, ', check the CDC website for vaccinations and immunizations', . In addition, specific travel vaccines such as typhoid, yellow fever, or rabies vaccines may be indicated. Various types of medication may also be needed to prevent life-threatening malaria or altitude illness; or to treat traveler\u2019s diarrhea. Finally, students should learn and utilize insect precautions, food and water precautions, and general safety precautions. These can prevent illnesses such as dengue fever, schistosomiasis, HIV; or accidents such as those involving motor vehicles. In spite of all the precautions, occasionally students due become ill or sustain an injury while traveling. Thankfully, most of these are minor.
