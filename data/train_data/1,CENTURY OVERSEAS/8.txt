                                                    ', The westward expansion of the United States during the 19th century was not
                    limited to North America, but rather included an ongoing push to establish a
                    stronger U.S. presence in and across the Pacific Ocean. This maritime expansion,
                    driven mostly by commerce, had important implications for U.S. foreign
                    policy.',

                                                    ', The appeal of profits to be earned from the China trade served as the initial
                    impetus to motivate U.S. citizens and officials to enter into the Pacific
                    region. ', China',  was the source of some of the world\u2019s most
                    sought after commodities\u2014tea, porcelain, and silk\u2014and Western merchants had
                    sought access to this highly lucrative trade since at least the 17th century.
                    Following U.S. independence, U.S.-based merchants continued to seek opportunity
                    in China. In February 1784 the Empress of China became the first ship to sail
                    from the United States to China, and in its wake came a steady flow of merchants
                    in search of wealth. During the first decades of the 19th century, U.S.
                    merchants amassed sizable fortunes that they subsequently invested in the
                    development of their homeland. As this trade grew, U.S. traders built a small
                    outpost in China and their interactions with Chinese subjects became more
                    complex and occasionally contentious. The U.S. Government realized that it had
                    to establish formal diplomatic ties in order to protect the interests of its
                    citizens. In the wake of war between Britain and China, and the subsequent
                    opening of diplomatic relations between those two countries, the United States
                    moved to negotiate its own treaty with the Chinese Government. The resulting
                    agreement, ', the Treaty of
                        Wangxia', , was ratified in 1844, and soon thereafter U.S. ministers and
                    consuls took up residence in China\u2019s capital and port cities.', 
                                                    ', Making the journey to ', China',  and maintaining the U.S.
                    presence there also required a network of ports extending across the Pacific
                    Ocean, and as such, the ', China',  trade soon drove the United
                    States to expand its presence throughout the Pacific region. Perhaps most
                    significantly, when Commodore Matthew Perry sailed his ships to Japan in 1853,
                    his primary motivation was to establish a foothold that would strengthen the
                    U.S. position for trade and diplomacy in the region. In other words, the United
                    States opened relations with ', Japan',  in large part to
                    enhance its status in China. On a smaller scale, as U.S. merchants began to stop
                    at many of the Pacific Islands to replenish supplies and acquire goods to trade
                    with Chinese merchants, the U.S. Government appointed consuls to several of
                    these places. For example, consulates were established in Fiji in 1844, Samoa in
                    1856, and the Marshall Islands in 1881. The U.S. presence in Hawai\u2019i grew out of
                    the need for a substantial base of operations in the Pacific to support U.S.
                    interests in ', China', . Ultimately this need became so great,
                    and the U.S. presence so large, that the ', United States', 
                    annexed the islands in ', 1898', .',

                                                    ', The process of U.S. maritime expansion in the Pacific eventually became a goal in
                    and of itself, culminating in the acquisition of the Philippines from Spain in
                    1898. ', The
                        Spanish-American War',  began with a dispute over Cuba, but a rising tide
                    of interest in overseas empire among U.S. leaders, such as President
                        ', William McKinley',  and future President
                        ', Theodore Roosevelt', , helped expand the conflict to
                    Spanish possessions in Asia. After a swift victory over Spain, the United States
                    set up a temporary military administration to govern the islands and promote
                    their political, economic, and social development. The ', United
                        States',  established full colonial rule over the
                        ', Philippines',  in ', 1900',  during
                    the ',  Philippine-American War', .', 
                                                    ', U.S. expansion across the Pacific fundamentally changed the global position of
                    the United States. In 1800, the United States held closely to ', George
                        Washington', \u2019s advice to avoid \u201centangling alliances\u201d while
                    pursuing foreign relations based upon trade. By 1900, the United States was a
                    recognized world power with substantial commercial, political, and military
                    interests and territorial holdings throughout the Pacific region. Maritime
                    expansion led to the proclamation of an ', Open Door policy for
                            ', China',  in 1899­\u20131900, and set the stage for much greater involvement in local
                    and regional politics and trade during the early 20th century.',

                    limited to North America, but rather included an ongoing push to establish a
                    stronger U.S. presence in and across the Pacific Ocean. This maritime expansion,
                    driven mostly by commerce, had important implications for U.S. foreign
                    policy.',

                                                    ', The appeal of profits to be earned from the China trade served as the initial
                    impetus to motivate U.S. citizens and officials to enter into the Pacific
                    region. ', China',  was the source of some of the world\u2019s most
                    sought after commodities\u2014tea, porcelain, and silk\u2014and Western merchants had
                    sought access to this highly lucrative trade since at least the 17th century.
                    Following U.S. independence, U.S.-based merchants continued to seek opportunity
                    in China. In February 1784 the Empress of China became the first ship to sail
                    from the United States to China, and in its wake came a steady flow of merchants
                    in search of wealth. During the first decades of the 19th century, U.S.
                    merchants amassed sizable fortunes that they subsequently invested in the
                    development of their homeland. As this trade grew, U.S. traders built a small
                    outpost in China and their interactions with Chinese subjects became more
                    complex and occasionally contentious. The U.S. Government realized that it had
                    to establish formal diplomatic ties in order to protect the interests of its
                    citizens. In the wake of war between Britain and China, and the subsequent
                    opening of diplomatic relations between those two countries, the United States
                    moved to negotiate its own treaty with the Chinese Government. The resulting
                    agreement, ', the Treaty of
                        Wangxia', , was ratified in 1844, and soon thereafter U.S. ministers and
                    consuls took up residence in China\u2019s capital and port cities.', 
                                                    ', Making the journey to ', China',  and maintaining the U.S.
                    presence there also required a network of ports extending across the Pacific
                    Ocean, and as such, the ', China',  trade soon drove the United
                    States to expand its presence throughout the Pacific region. Perhaps most
                    significantly, when Commodore Matthew Perry sailed his ships to Japan in 1853,
                    his primary motivation was to establish a foothold that would strengthen the
                    U.S. position for trade and diplomacy in the region. In other words, the United
                    States opened relations with ', Japan',  in large part to
                    enhance its status in China. On a smaller scale, as U.S. merchants began to stop
                    at many of the Pacific Islands to replenish supplies and acquire goods to trade
                    with Chinese merchants, the U.S. Government appointed consuls to several of
                    these places. For example, consulates were established in Fiji in 1844, Samoa in
                    1856, and the Marshall Islands in 1881. The U.S. presence in Hawai\u2019i grew out of
                    the need for a substantial base of operations in the Pacific to support U.S.
                    interests in ', China', . Ultimately this need became so great,
                    and the U.S. presence so large, that the ', United States', 
                    annexed the islands in ', 1898', .',

                                                    ', The process of U.S. maritime expansion in the Pacific eventually became a goal in
                    and of itself, culminating in the acquisition of the Philippines from Spain in
                    1898. ', The
                        Spanish-American War',  began with a dispute over Cuba, but a rising tide
                    of interest in overseas empire among U.S. leaders, such as President
                        ', William McKinley',  and future President
                        ', Theodore Roosevelt', , helped expand the conflict to
                    Spanish possessions in Asia. After a swift victory over Spain, the United States
                    set up a temporary military administration to govern the islands and promote
                    their political, economic, and social development. The ', United
                        States',  established full colonial rule over the

                    the United States. In 1800, the United States held closely to ', George
                        Washington', \u2019s advice to avoid \u201centangling alliances\u201d while
                    pursuing foreign relations based upon trade. By 1900, the United States was a
                    recognized world power with substantial commercial, political, and military
                    interests and territorial holdings throughout the Pacific region. Maritime
                    expansion led to the proclamation of an ', Open Door policy for
                            ', China',  in 1899­\u20131900, and set the stage for much greater involvement in local
                    and regional politics and trade during the early 20th century.',
