', The ', Age of Discovery',  or the ', Age of Exploration',  from the end of the ', 15th century',  to the ', 18th century', , was an informal and loosely defined ', European',  ', historical period',  marking the time period in which extensive overseas exploration emerged as a powerful factor in ', European culture',  and the beginning of ', globalization', . It also marks the rise of the period of widespread belief in Europe of the philosophies of ', Colonialism',  and ', Mercantilism', . Many lands previously unknown to Europeans were discovered during this period, though most were already inhabited. From the perspective of many non-Europeans, the age of discovery marked the arrival of settlers and invaders from a previously unknown continent.', 
', Global exploration started with the ', Portuguese discoveries',  of the ', Atlantic',  ', archipelagos',  of ', Madeira',  and the ', Azores', , the coast of ', Africa', , and the ', discovery of the sea route to India',  in 1498; and, on behalf of the ', Crown of Castile',  (Spain), the trans-Atlantic ', Voyages of Christopher Columbus',  between 1492 and 1502, and the first ', circumnavigation of the globe',  in 1519\u20131522. These discoveries led to numerous naval expeditions across the Atlantic, ', Indian',  and ', Pacific',  oceans, and land expeditions in the ', Americas', , ', Asia', , ', Africa', , and ', Australia',  that continued into the late ', 19th century', , and ended with the exploration of the polar regions in the ', 20th century', .', 
', European overseas exploration led to the rise of global trade and the European ', colonial empires', , with the contact between the ', Old World',  (Europe, Asia and Africa) and the ', New World',  (the Americas and Australia) producing the ', Columbian Exchange', : a wide transfer of plants, animals, food, human populations (including ', slaves', ), ', communicable diseases',  and culture between the ', Eastern',  and ', Western',  ', Hemispheres', . This represented one of the most-significant ', global',  events concerning ecology, agriculture, and culture in history. The Age of Discovery and later ', European exploration',  allowed the global mapping of the world, resulting in a new world-view and distant civilizations coming into contact, but also led to the propagation of diseases that decimated populations not previously in contact with Eurasia and Africa, and to the enslavement, exploitation, military conquest, and economic dominance of Europe and its colonies over native populations. It also allowed for the expansion of ', Christianity', u" throughout the world with the spread of missionary activity, becoming the world's largest religion.", [1]', [2]',

', The Portuguese began systematically exploring the Atlantic coast of Africa from 1418, under the sponsorship of ', Prince Henry', u". Under Henry's direction, a new and much lighter ship was developed, the ", caravel', , which could sail further and faster,', [3]',  and, above all, was highly manoeuvrable and could sail much nearer the wind, or ', into the wind', . In 1488 ', Bartolomeu Dias',  reached the Indian Ocean by this route.', [4]',  In 1492 the ', Catholic Monarchs',  of Castile and ', Aragon',  funded ', Christopher Columbus', u"'s plan to sail west to reach the Indies by crossing the Atlantic. He landed on a continent uncharted by Europeans and seen as a ", new world', , the Americas. To prevent conflict between Portugal and Castile (the crown under which Columbus made the voyage), the ', Treaty of Tordesillas',  was signed dividing the world into two regions of exploration, where each had exclusive rights to claim newly discovered lands.', [5]', [6]', 
', In 1498, a Portuguese expedition commanded by ', Vasco da Gama',  reached India by sailing around Africa, opening up direct trade with Asia.', [7]',  While other exploratory fleets were sent from Portugal to northern North America, in the following years ', Portuguese India Armadas',  also extended this Eastern oceanic route, touching sometimes South America and by this way opening a circuit from the New World to Asia (starting in 1500, under the command of ', Pedro Alvares Cabral', ), and explored islands in the South Atlantic and Southern Indian Oceans. Soon, the Portuguese sailed further eastward, to the valuable ', spice islands',  in 1512, landing in China one year later. In 1513, Spanish ', Vasco Núñez de Balboa',  crossed the ', Isthmus of Panama',  and reached the "other sea" from the New World. Thus, Europe first received news of the eastern and western Pacific within a one-year span around 1512. East and west exploration overlapped in 1522, when a Castilian (Spanish) expedition, led by Portuguese navigator ', Ferdinand Magellan',  and later by Spanish Basque navigator ', Juan Sebastián Elcano', , sailing Westward, completed the first circumnavigation of the world,', [8]',  while Spanish ', conquistadors',  explored the inland of the Americas, and later, some of the South Pacific islands.', 
', Since 1495, the French and English and, much later, the ', Dutch',  entered the race of exploration after learning of these exploits, defying the Iberian monopoly on maritime trade by searching for new routes, first to the western coasts of North and South America, through the first English and French expeditions (starting with the first expedition of ', John Cabot',  in 1497 to the north, in the service of England, followed by the French expeditions to South America and later to North America), and into the Pacific Ocean around South America, but eventually by following the Portuguese around Africa into the Indian Ocean; discovering Australia in 1606, New Zealand in 1642, and Hawaii in 1778. Meanwhile, from the 1580s to the 1640s Russians explored and conquered almost the whole of ', Siberia', , and Alaska in the 1730s.',

', European medieval knowledge about Asia beyond the reach of the ', Byzantine Empire',  was sourced in partial reports, often obscured by legends,', [9]',  dating back from the time of the conquests of ', Alexander the Great',  and his successors. Another source was the ', Radhanite Jewish trade networks',  of merchants established as go-betweens between Europe and the Muslim world during the time of the ', Crusader states', .', 
', In 1154, the ', Arab geographer',  ', Muhammad al-Idrisi',  created a description of the world and a ', world map', , the ', Tabula Rogeriana', , at the court of King ', Roger II of Sicily', ,', [10]', [11]',  but still Africa was only partially known to either Christians, Genoese and Venetians, or the Arab seamen, and its southern extent unknown. There were reports of great African ', Sahara', , but the factual knowledge was limited for the Europeans to the Mediterranean coasts and little else since the Arab blockade of North Africa precluded exploration inland. Knowledge about the Atlantic African coast was fragmented and derived mainly from ', old',  Greek and Roman maps based on Carthaginian knowledge, including the time of ', Roman',  exploration of ', Mauritania', . The ', Red Sea',  was barely known and only trade links with the ', Maritime republics', , the ', Republic of Venice',  especially, fostered collection of accurate maritime knowledge.', [12]', 
', Indian Ocean trade routes were sailed by Arab traders. Between 1405 and 1421, the ', Yongle Emperor',  of ', Ming China',  sponsored a series of long range ', tributary missions',  under the command of ', Zheng He',  (Cheng Ho).', [13]',  The fleets visited ', Arabia', , ', East Africa', , ', India', , ', Maritime Southeast Asia',  and ', Thailand', . But the journeys, reported by ', Ma Huan', , a ', Muslim', u" voyager and translator, were halted abruptly after the emperor's death", [14]',  and were not followed up, as the Chinese ', Ming Dynasty',  retreated in the ', haijin', , a policy of ', isolationism', , having limited maritime trade.', 
', By 1400 a Latin translation of ', Ptolemy', u"'s ", Geographia',  reached Italy coming from Constantinople. The rediscovery of Roman geographical knowledge was a revelation,', [15]',  both for mapmaking and worldview,', [16]',  although reinforcing the idea that the Indian Ocean was landlocked.',

', A prelude to the Age of Discovery was a series of European expeditions crossing ', Eurasia',  by land in the late Middle Ages.', [17]',  Although the ', Mongols',  had threatened Europe with pillage and destruction,', [', clarification needed', ]',  Mongol states also unified much of Eurasia and, from 1206 on, the ', Pax Mongolica',  allowed safe trade routes and communication lines stretching from the Middle East to China.', [18]', [19]',  A series of Europeans took advantage of these to explore eastwards. Most were Italians, as trade between Europe and the Middle East was controlled mainly by the ', Maritime republics', .', [', citation needed', ]',  The close ', Italian',  links to the ', Levant',  raised great curiosity and commercial interest in countries which lay further east.', [', citation needed', ]', 
', Christian embassies were sent as far as ', Karakorum',  during the ', Mongol invasions of Syria', , from which they gained a greater understanding of the world.', [', citation needed', ]',  The first of these travelers was ', Giovanni da Pian del Carpine', , dispatched by ', Pope Innocent IV',  to the ', Great Khan', , who journeyed to ', Mongolia',  and back from 1241 to 1247.', [18]',  About the same time, Russian prince ', Yaroslav of Vladimir', , and subsequently his sons ', Alexander Nevsky',  and ', Andrey II of Vladimir', , traveled to the Mongolian capital. Though having strong political implications, their journeys left no detailed accounts. Other travelers followed, like French ', André de Longjumea,  and Flemish ', William of Rubruck', , who reached China through Central Asia.', [20]',  ', Marco Polo', , a Venetian merchant, dictated an account of journeys throughout Asia from 1271 to 1295, describing being a guest at the ', Yuan Dynasty',  court of ', Kublai Khan',  in ', Travels', , and it was read throughout Europe.', [21]', 
', In 1291, in a first Atlantic exploration attempt, merchant brothers ', Vadino and Ugolino Vivaldi',  sailed from Genoa with two galleys but disappeared off the Moroccan coast, feeding the fears of oceanic travel.', [22]', [23]',  From 1325 to 1354, a ', Moroccan',  scholar from ', Tangier', , ', Ibn Battuta', , journeyed through North Africa, the Sahara desert, West Africa, Southern Europe, Eastern Europe, the Horn of Africa, the Middle East and Asia, having reached China. After returning, he dictated an account of his journeys to a scholar he met in Granada, the ', Rihla',  ("The Journey"),', [24]',  the unheralded source on his adventures. Between 1357 and 1371 a book of supposed travels compiled by ', John Mandeville',  acquired extraordinary popularity. Despite the unreliable and often fantastical nature of its accounts it was used as a reference', [25]',  for the East, Egypt, and the Levant in general, asserting the old belief that Jerusalem was the ', center of the world', .', 
', Following the period of ', Timurid relations with Europe', , in 1439 ', u"Niccolò de' Conti",  published an account of his travels as a Muslim merchant to India and Southeast Asia and, later in 1466\u20131472, Russian merchant ', Afanasy Nikitin',  of ', Tver',  travelled to India, which he described in his book ', A Journey Beyond the Three Seas', .', 
', These overland journeys had little immediate effect. The ', Mongol Empire',  collapsed almost as quickly as it formed and soon the route to the east became more difficult and dangerous. The ', Black Death',  of the 14th century also blocked travel and trade.', [26]',  The rise of the ', Ottoman Empire',  further limited the possibilities of European overland trade.',

', The Chinese had wide connections through trade in Asia and had been sailing to ', Arabia', , ', East Africa', , and ', Egypt',  since the ', Tang Dynasty',  (AD 618\u2013907). Between 1405 and 1421 the third Ming emperor ', Yongle',  sponsored a series of long range ', tributary missions',  in the Indian Ocean under the command of admiral ', Zheng He',  (Cheng Ho).', [13]', 
', A large fleet of new ', junk',  ships was prepared for these international diplomatic expeditions. The largest of these junks\u2014that the Chinese termed ', bao chuan',  (treasure ships)', \u2014may have measured 121 meters (400 feet) stem to stern, and thousands of sailors were involved. The first expedition departed in 1405. At least seven well-documented expeditions were launched, each bigger and more expensive than the last. The fleets visited ', Arabia', , ', East Africa', , ', India', , ', Malay Archipelago',  and ', Thailand',  (at the time called ', Siam', ), exchanging goods along the way.', [27]',  They presented gifts of gold, silver, ', porcelain',  and ', silk', ; in return, received such novelties as ', ostriches', , ', zebras', , ', camels', , ', ivory',  and ', giraffes', .', [28]', [29]', u" After the emperor's death, Zheng He led a final expedition departing from Nanking in 1431 and returning to Beijing in 1433. It is very likely that this last expedition reached as far as ", Madagascar', . The travels were reported by ', Ma Huan', , a Muslim voyager and translator who accompanied Zeng He on three of the seven expeditions, his account published as "Ying-Yai Sheng-Lam" (Overall Survey of the Ocean's Shores) (1433)', [30]', 
', These long distance journeys were not followed up, as the Chinese Ming dynasty retreated in the ', haijin', , a policy of ', isolationism', u", having limited maritime trade. Travels were halted abruptly after the emperor's death, as the Chinese lost interest in what they termed barbarian lands turning inward,", [14]',  and successor emperors felt the expeditions were harmful to the Chinese state; ', Hongxi Emperor',  ended further expeditions and ', Xuande Emperor', u" suppressed much of the information about Zheng He's voyages.",

', 
', 
', From the 8th century until the 15th century, the ', Republic of Venice',  and neighboring ', maritime republics',  held the monopoly of European trade with the Middle East. The ', silk',  and ', spice trade', , involving ', spices', , ', incense', , ', herbs', , ', drugs',  and ', opium', , made these Mediterranean city-states phenomenally rich. Spices were among the most expensive and demanded products of the Middle Ages, as they were used in ', medieval medicine', ,', [31]',  religious ', rituals', , ', cosmetics', , ', perfumery', , as well as ', food additives',  and ', preservatives', .', [32]',  They were all imported from Asia and Africa.', 
', Muslim traders\u2014mainly descendants of Arab sailors from ', Yemen',  and ', Oman', \u2014dominated maritime routes throughout the Indian Ocean, tapping source regions in the Far East and shipping for trading emporiums in India, mainly ', Kozhikode', , westward to ', Ormus',  in the ', Persian Gulf',  and ', Jeddah',  in the ', Red Sea', . From there, overland routes led to the Mediterranean coasts. Venetian merchants distributed the goods through Europe until the rise of the ', Ottoman Empire', , that eventually led to the ', fall of Constantinople',  in 1453, barring Europeans from important combined-land-sea routes.', [33]', [34]', 
', Forced to reduce their activities in the Black Sea, and at war with Venice, the ', Genoese',  had turned to North African trade of wheat, ', olive oil',  (valued also as an energy source) and a search for silver and gold. Europeans had a constant ', deficit in silver and gold', ,', [35]',  as coin only went one way: out, spent on eastern trade that was now cut off. Several European mines were exhausted,', [36]',  the lack of ', bullion',  leading to the development of a complex banking system to manage the risks in trade (the very first state bank, ', Banco di San Giorgio', , was founded in 1407 at Genoa). Sailing also into the ports of ', Bruges',  (Flanders) and England, Genoese communities were then established in Portugal,', [37]',  who profited from their enterprise and financial expertise.', 
', European sailing had been primarily close to land ', cabotage', , guided by ', portolan charts', . These charts specified proven ocean routes guided by coastal landmarks: sailors departed from a known point, followed a ', compass',  heading, and tried to identify their location by its landmarks.', [38]',  For the first oceanic exploration Western Europeans used the ', compass', , as well as progressive new advances in ', cartography',  and ', astronomy', . Arab navigational tools like the ', astrolabe',  and ', quadrant',  were used for ', celestial navigation', .',

', In 1297, with the Portuguese part of the ', reconquista',  completed, King ', Dinis of Portugal',  took personal interest in exports and in 1317 he made an agreement with Genoese merchant sailor ', Manuel Pessanha',  (Pesagno), appointing him first ', admiral',  of the ', Portuguese navy', , with the goal of defending the country against Muslim pirate raids.', [39]',  Outbreaks of ', bubonic plague',  led to severe depopulation in the second half of the 14th century: only the sea offered alternatives, with most population settling in fishing and trading coastal areas.', [40]',  Between 1325 and 1357 ', Afonso IV of Portugal',  encouraged maritime commerce and ordered the first explorations.', [41]',  The ', Canary Islands', , already known to the Genoese, were claimed as officially discovered under patronage of the Portuguese but in 1344 Castile disputed them, expanding their rivalry into the sea.', [42]', [43]', 
', In 1415, ', Ceuta',  was ', conquered',  by the Portuguese aiming to control navigation of the African coast. Young prince ', Henry the Navigator',  was there and became aware of profit possibilities in the ', Trans-Saharan trade',  routes. For centuries ', slave and gold',  trade routes linking West Africa with the Mediterranean passed over the Western Sahara Desert, controlled by the Moors of North Africa.', 
', Henry wished to know how far Muslim territories in Africa extended, hoping to bypass them and trade directly with West Africa by sea, find allies in legendary Christian lands to the south', [44]',  like the long-lost Christian kingdom of ', Prester John', [45]',  and to probe whether it was possible to reach the ', Indies',  by sea, the source of the lucrative ', spice trade', . He invested in sponsoring voyages down the coast of ', Mauritania', , gathering a group of merchants, shipowners and stakeholders interested in new sea lanes. Soon the Atlantic islands of ', Madeira',  (1419) and the ', Azores',  (1427) were reached. In particular, they were discovered by voyages launched by the command of Prince ', Henry the Navigator', . The expedition leader himself, who established settlements on the island of Madeira, was ', João Gonçalves Zarco', .', [46]', 
', At the time, Europeans did not know what lay beyond ', Cape Non',  (Cape Chaunar) on the African coast, and whether it was possible to return once it was crossed.', [47]', u" Nautical myths warned of oceanic monsters or an edge of the world, but Prince Henry's navigation challenged such beliefs: starting in 1421, systematic sailing overcame it, reaching the difficult ", Cape Bojador', u" that in 1434 one of Prince Henry's captains, ", Gil Eanes', , finally passed.', 
', A major advance was the introduction of the ', caravel',  in the mid-15th century, a small ship able to sail ', windward',  more than any other in Europe at the time.', [48]',  Evolved from fishing ships designs, they were the first that could leave the coastal ', cabotage',  navigation and sail safely on the open Atlantic. For ', celestial navigation',  the Portuguese used the ', Ephemerides', , which experienced a remarkable diffusion in the 15th century. These were astronomical charts plotting the location of the stars over a distinct period of time. Published in 1496 by the Jewish astronomer, astrologer, and mathematician ', Abraham Zacuto', , the ', Almanach Perpetuum',  included some of these tables for the movements of stars.', [49]',  These tables revolutionized navigation, allowing the calculation of ', latitude', . Exact ', longitude', , however, remained elusive, and mariners struggled to determine it for centuries.', [50]', [51]',  Using the caravel, systematic exploration continued ever more southerly, advancing on average one degree a year.', [52]',  ', Senegal',  and ', Cape Verde Peninsula',  were reached in 1445 and in 1446, ', Álvaro Fernandes',  pushed on almost as far as present-day ', Sierra Leone', .', 
', In 1453 the ', fall of Constantinople',  to the hands of the ', Ottomans',  was a blow to Christendom and the established business relations linking with the east. In 1455 ', Pope Nicholas V',  issued the ', bull',  ', Romanus Pontifex',  reinforcing the previous ', Dum Diversas',  (1452), granting all lands and seas discovered beyond Cape Bojador to King ', Afonso V of Portugal',  and his successors, as well as trade and conquest against Muslims and pagans, initiating a ', mare clausum',  policy in the Atlantic.', [53]',  The king, who had been inquiring of Genoese experts about a seaway to India, commissioned the ', Fra Mauro world map', , which arrived in Lisbon in 1459.', [54]', 
', In 1456 ', Diogo Gomes',  reached the ', Cape Verde',  archipelago. In the next decade several captains at the service of Prince Henry \u2013 including the Genoese ', Antonio da Noli',  and Venetian ', Alvise Cadamosto',  \u2013 discovered the remaining islands which were occupied during the 15th century. The Gulf of Guinea would be reached in the 1460s.',

', Portuguese exploration after Prince Henry', [', edit', ]', 
', In 1460 ', Pedro de Sintra',  reached Sierra Leone. Prince Henry died in November that year after which, given the meager revenues, exploration was granted to Lisbon merchant ', Fernão Gomes',  in 1469, who in exchange for the monopoly of trade in the Gulf of Guinea had to explore 100 miles (161 kilometres) each year for five years.', [55]',  With his sponsorship, explorers ', João de Santarém', , ', Pedro Escobar', , Lopo Gonçalves, ', Fernão do Pó', , and Pedro de Sintra made it even beyond those goals. They reached the Southern Hemisphere and the islands of the Gulf of Guinea, including ', São Tomé and Príncipe',  and ', Elmina',  on the Gold Coast in 1471. (In the Southern Hemisphere, they used the ', Southern Cross',  as the reference for celestial navigation.) There, in what came to be called the "Gold Coast" in what is today ', Ghana', , a thriving alluvial gold trade was found among the natives and Arab and ', Berber',  traders.', 
', In 1478 (during the War of the Castilian Succession), near the coast at Elmina was fought a large battle between a Castilian armada of 35 caravels and a Portuguese fleet for hegemony of the Guinea trade (gold, slaves, ivory and melegueta pepper). The war ended with a Portuguese naval victory followed by the official recognition by the Catholic Monarchs of Portuguese sovereignty over most of the disputed West African territories embodied in the Treaty of Alcáçovas, 1479.

', The next crucial breakthrough was in 1488, when ', Bartolomeu Dias',  rounded the southern tip of Africa, which he named "Cape of Storms" (Cabo das Tormentas), anchoring at ', Mossel Bay',  and then sailing east as far as the mouth of the ', Great Fish River', , proving that the Indian Ocean was accessible from the Atlantic.

', u"Portugal's neighbouring fellow Iberian rival, ", Castile', , had begun to establish its rule over the ', Canary Islands', , located off the west African coast, in 1402, but then became distracted by internal Iberian politics and the repelling of Islamic invasion attempts and raids through most of the 15th century. Only late in the century, following the unification of the crowns of Castile and Aragon and the completion of the ', reconquista', , did an emerging modern Spain become fully committed to the search for new trade routes overseas. The ', Crown of Aragon',  had been an important maritime potentate in the Mediterranean, controlling territories in eastern Spain, southwestern France, major islands like ', Sicily', , ', Malta', , and the ', Kingdom of Naples',  and ', Sardinia', , with mainland possessions as far as Greece. In 1492 the ', joint rulers',  conquered the ', Moorish kingdom of Granada', , which had been providing Castile with African goods through tribute, and decided to fund ', Christopher Columbus', 's expedition in the hope of bypassing Portugal's monopoly on west African sea routes, to reach "the Indies" (east and south Asia) by travelling west.', [59]',  Twice before, in 1485 and 1488, Columbus had presented the project to king ', John II of Portugal', , who rejected it.', 
', On the evening of 3 August 1492, Columbus departed from ', Palos de la Frontera',  with three ships; one larger ', carrack', , ', Santa María', , nicknamed ', Gallega',  (', the Galician', ), and two smaller ', caravels', , ', Pinta',  (', the Painted', ) and ', Santa Clara', , nicknamed ', Niña', . Columbus first sailed to the Canary Islands, where he restocked for what turned out to be a five-week voyage across the ocean, crossing a section of the Atlantic that became known as the ', Sargasso Sea', .', 
', Land was sighted on 12 October 1492, and Columbus called the island (now ', The Bahamas', ) ', San Salvador', , in what he thought to be the "', West Indies', ". Columbus also explored the northeast coast of ', Cuba',  (landed on 28 October) and the northern coast of ', Hispaniola', , by 5 December. He was received by the native ', cacique',  ', Guacanagari', , who gave him permission to leave some of his men behind.',

Only seven or eight of the native ', Indians',  arrived in Spain alive, but they made quite an impression on Seville.', [61]', 
', On the return, a storm forced him to dock in ', Lisbon', , on 4 March 1493. After a week in Portugal, he set sail for Spain and on 15 March 1493 arrived in ', Barcelona', , where he reported to Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand. Word of his discovery of new lands ', rapidly spread throughout Europe', .', [62]', 
', Columbus and other Spanish explorers were initially disappointed with their discoveries \u2014 unlike Africa or Asia, the Caribbean islanders had little to trade with the Castilian ships. The islands thus became the focus of colonization efforts. It was not until the continent itself was explored that Spain found the wealth it had sought.',

', Shortly after Columbus's return from what would later be called the "West Indies", a division of influence became necessary to avoid conflict between the Spanish and Portuguese.', [63]', u" On 4 May 1493, two months after Columbus's arrival, the ", Catholic Monarchs',  received a ', bull',  (', Inter caetera', ) from ', Pope Alexander VI',  stating that all lands west and south of a pole-to-pole line 100 leagues west and south of the ', Azores',  or the Cape Verde Islands should belong to Castile and, later, all mainlands and islands then belonging to India. It did not mention Portugal, which could not claim newly discovered lands east of the line.', 
', King ', John II of Portugal',  was not pleased with the arrangement, feeling that it gave him far too little land\u2014preventing him from reaching India, his main goal. He then negotiated directly with King ', Ferdinand',  and Queen ', Isabella',  of Spain to move the line west, and allowing him to claim newly discovered lands east of it.', [64]', 
', An agreement was reached in 1494, with the ', Treaty of Tordesillas',  that divided the world between the two powers. In this treaty the Portuguese received everything outside Europe east of a line that ran 370 ', leagues',  west of the ', Cape Verde',  islands (already Portuguese), and the islands discovered by ', Christopher Columbus',  on his first voyage (claimed for Spain), named in the treaty as ', Cipang,  and ', Antilia',  (', Cuba',  and ', Hispaniola', ). This gave them control over Africa, Asia and eastern South America (Brazil). The Spanish (Castile) received everything west of this line. At the time of negotiation, the treaty split the known world of Atlantic islands roughly in half, with the dividing line about halfway between Portuguese Cape Verde and the Spanish discoveries in the Caribbean.', 
', Pedro Álvares Cabral',  encountered in 1500 what is now known as the Brazilian coast, originally thought to be a large island. Since it was east of the dividing line, he claimed it for Portugal and this was respected by the Spanish. Portuguese ships sailed west into the Atlantic to get favorable winds for the journey to India, and this is where Cabral was headed on his journey, in a corridor the treaty was negotiated to protect. Some suspect the Portuguese had secretly discovered Brazil earlier, and this is why they had the line moved eastward and how Cabral found it, but there is no reliable evidence of this. Others suspect ', Duarte Pacheco Pereira',  secretly discovered Brazil in 1498, but this not considered credible by mainstream historians.', 
', Later the Spanish territory would prove to include huge areas of the continental mainland of North and South America, though Portuguese-controlled Brazil would expand across the line, and settlements by other European powers ignored the treaty.',

', u"Very little of the divided area had actually been seen by Europeans, as it was only divided by a geographical definition rather than control on the ground. Columbus's first voyage in 1492 spurred maritime exploration and, from 1497, a number of explorers headed west.", 
', North America', [', edit', ]', 
', That year ', John Cabot', , also a commissioned Italian, got ', letters patent',  from King ', Henry VII of England', . Sailing from ', Bristol', , probably backed by the local ', Society of Merchant Venturers', , Cabot crossed the Atlantic from a northerly latitude hoping the voyage to the "West Indies" would be shorter', [65]',  and made a landfall somewhere in North America, possibly ', Newfoundland', . In 1499 ', João Fernandes Lavrador',  was licensed by the King of Portugal and together with ', Pêro de Barcelos',  they first sighted ', Labrador', , which was granted and named after him. After returning he possibly went to Bristol to sail in the name of England.', [66]',  Nearly at the same time, between 1499 and 1502 brothers ', Gaspar',  and ', Miguel Corte Real',  explored and named the coasts of ', Greenland',  and also Newfoundland.', [67]',  Both explorations are noted in the 1502 ', Cantino planisphere', .', 
', The "True Indies" and Brazil', [', edit', ]', 
', In 1497, newly crowned King ', Manuel I of Portugal',  sent an exploratory fleet eastwards, fulfilling his predecessor's project of finding a route to the Indies. In July 1499 news spread that the Portuguese had reached the "true indies", as a letter was dispatched by the Portuguese king to the Spanish Catholic Monarchs one day after the celebrated return of the fleet.', [68]', 
', The third expedition by Columbus in 1498 was the beginning of the first successful Castilian (Spanish) colonization in the ', West Indies', , on the island of Hispaniola. Despite growing doubts, Columbus refused to accept that he had not reached the Indies. During the voyage he discovered the mouth of the ', Orinoco River',  on the north coast of South America (now Venezuela) and thought that the huge quantity of fresh water coming from it could only be from a continental land mass, which he was certain was the Asian mainland.', 
', As shipping between ', Seville',  and the West Indies grew, knowledge of the Caribbean islands, Central America and the northern coast of South America grew. One of these Spanish fleets, that of ', Alonso de Ojeda',  and ', Amerigo Vespucci',  in 1499\u20131500, reached land at the coast of what is now ', Guyana', , when the two explorers seem to have separated in opposite directions. Vespucci sailed southward, discovering the mouth of the ', Amazon River',  in July 1499,', [69]', [70]',  and reaching 6°S, in present-day north east ', Brazil', , before turning around.', 
', In the beginning of 1500 ', Vicente Yáñez Pinzon',  was blown off course by a storm and reached what is now the north east coast of Brazil on 26 January 1500, exploring as far south as the present-day state of ', Pernambuco', . His fleet was the first to fully enter the Amazon River estuary which he named ', Río Santa María de la Mar Dulce',  (', u"Saint Mary's River of the Sweet Sea", ).', [71]',  However, the land was too far east for the Castilians to claim under the Treaty of Tordesillas, but the discovery created Castilian (', Spanish', ) interest, with a second voyage by Pinzon in 1508 (an expedition that coasted the northern coast to the Central American coastal mainland, in search of a passage to the East) and a voyage in 1515\u201316 by a navigator of the 1508 expedition, ', Juan Díaz de Solís', . The 1515\u201316 expedition was spurred on by reports of Portuguese exploration of the region (see below). It ended when de Solís and some of his crew disappeared when exploring a ', River Plate',  river in a boat, but what it found re-ignited Spanish interest, and colonization began in 1531.', 
', In April 1500, the ', second Portuguese India Armada', , headed by ', Pedro Álvares Cabral', , with a crew of expert captains, including Bartolomeu Dias and ', Nicolau Coelho', , encountered the Brazilian coast as it swung westward in the Atlantic while performing a large "', volta do mar', " to avoid becalming in the ', Gulf of Guinea', . On 21 April 1500 a mountain was seen and was named ', Monte Pascoal', , and on the 22nd of April Cabral landed on the coast. On 25 April the entire fleet sailed into the harbor they named ', Porto Seguro',  (Port Secure). Cabral perceived that the new land lay east of the line of Tordesillas, and sent an envoy to Portugal with the discovery in letters, including the ', letter',  of ', Pero Vaz de Caminha', . Believing the land to be an island, he named it ', Ilha de Vera Cruz',  (Island of the True Cross).', [72]',  Some historians have suggested that the Portuguese may have encountered the South American bulge earlier while sailing the "volta do mar", hence the insistence of John II in moving the line west of Tordesillas in 1494\u2014so his landing in Brazil may not have been an accident; although John's motivation may have simply been to increase the chance of claiming new lands in the Atlantic.', [73]',  From the east coast, the fleet then turned eastward to resume the journey to the southern tip of Africa and India. Cabral was the first captain to touch four continents, leading the first expedition that connected and united Europe, Africa, the New World, and Asia.', [74]', [75]', 
', At the invitation of King Manuel I of Portugal, Amerigo Vespucci ', [76]',  \u2014 a Florentine who had been working for a branch of the ', Medici Bank',  in ', Seville',  since 1491, fitting oceanic expeditions and travelling twice to ', The Guianas',  with ', Juan de la Cosa',  in the service of Spain', [77]',  \u2014 participated as observer in these exploratory voyages to the east coast of South America. The expeditions became widely known in Europe after two accounts attributed to him, published between 1502 and 1504, suggested that the newly discovered lands were not the Indies but a "', New World', ",', [78]',  the ', Mundus novus', , Latin title of a contemporary document based on Vespucci letters to ', u"Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici", , which had become widely popular in Europe.', [79]',  It was soon understood that Columbus had not reached Asia but had found a new continent, the Americas. ', The Americas were named',  in 1507 by ', cartographers',  ', Martin Waldseemüller',  and ', Matthias Ringmann', , probably after Amerigo Vespucci.', 
', In 1501\u20131502, one of these Portuguese expeditions, led by ', Gonçalo Coelho',  (and/or ', André Gonçalves',  or ', Gaspar de Lemos', ), sailed south along the coast of South America to the bay of present-day ', Rio de Janeiro', . Amerigo Vespucci's account states that the expedition reached the latitude "South Pole elevation 52° S", in the "cold" latitudes of what is now southern ', Patagonia',  (possibly near the Strait), before turning back. Vespucci wrote that they headed toward the southwest and south, following "a long, unbending coastline" (apparently coincident with the southern South American coast). This seems controversial, since he changed part of his description in the subsequent letter, stating a shift, from about 32° S (Southern Brazil), to south-southeast, to open sea; maintaining, however, that they reached 50°/52° S (if it was by his own decision or by D. Manuel's censors who had to pressure him to alter his account, because he had revealed far too much to Lorenzo de' Medici and into the public domain, is unknown).', [80]', [81]', 
', In 1503, ', Binot Paulmier de Gonneville', , challenging the Portuguese policy of ', mare clausum', , led one of the earliest ', French',  ', Normand',  and ', Breton',  expeditions to Brazil. He intended to sail to the East Indies, but near the Cape of Good Hope his ship was diverted to west by a storm, and landed in the present day state of ', Santa Catarina',  (southern Brazil), on 5 January 1504.',

After they had navigated for nearly 300 km (186 mi) to round the cape, they again sighted the continent on the other side, and steered towards the northwest, but a storm prevented them from making any headway.

', As there was not a set eastern limit to the Tordesillas line, both kingdoms organized meetings to resolve the issue. From 1524 to 1529 Portuguese and Spanish experts met at Badajoz-Elvas trying to find the exact location of the ', antimeridian',  of Tordesillas, which would divide the world into two equal hemispheres. Each crown appointed three ', astronomers',  and ', cartographers', , three ', pilots',  and three mathematicians. ', Lopo Homem', , Portuguese cartographer and cosmographer was in the board, along with cartographer ', Diogo Ribeiro',  on the Spanish delegation.

The issue was settled only in 1529, after a long negotiation, with the signing of ', Treaty of Zaragoza', , that attributed the Maluku Islands to Portugal and the ', Philippines',  to Spain.', [103]', 
', Between 1525 and 1528 Portugal sent several expeditions around the Maluku Islands. ', Gomes de Sequeira',  and Diogo da Rocha were sent north by the governor of Ternate ', Jorge de Menezes', , being the first Europeans to reach the ', Caroline Islands', , which they named "Islands de Sequeira".', [104]',  In 1526, Jorge de Meneses docked on ', Biak',  and ', Waigeo',  islands, Papua New Guinea.

', Rumors of undiscovered islands northwest of ', Hispaniola',  had reached Spain by 1511 and king ', Ferdinand II of Aragon',  was interested in forestalling further exploration. While Portuguese were making huge gains in the Indian Ocean, the Spanish invested in exploring inland in search of gold and valuable resources. The members of these expeditions, the "', conquistadors', ", came from a variety of backgrounds including artisans, merchants, clergy, lesser nobility and freed slaves. They usually supplied their own equipment in exchange for a share in profits, having no direct connection with the royal army, and often no professional military training or experience.', [106]', 
', In the Americas the Spanish found a number of empires that were as large and populous as those in Europe. However, small bodies of ', conquistadors', , with large armies of ', Indigenous Americans',  groups, managed to conquer these states.

Once Spanish ', sovereignty',  was established, the Spanish focused on the extraction and export of gold and silver.', 
', In 1512, to reward ', Juan Ponce de León',  for exploring ', Puerto Rico',  in 1508, king Ferdinand urged him to seek these new lands. He would become governor of discovered lands, but was to finance himself all exploration.', [107]',  With three ships and about 200 men, Léon set out from Puerto Rico in March 1513.

These, along with the accounts of success of ', Hernán Cortés', , caught the attention of Pizarro.', 
', Francisco Pizarro',  had accompanied ', Balboa',  in the crossing of the ', Isthmus of Panama', . In 1524 he formed a partnership with priest ', Hernando de Luque',  and soldier ', Diego de Almagro',  to explore the south, agreeing to divide the profits. They dubbed the enterprise the "', Empresa del Levante', ": Pizarro would command, Almagro would provide military and food supplies, and Luque would be in charge of finances and additional provisions.', 
', On 13 September 1524, the first of three expeditions left to conquer ', Per,  with about 80 men and 40 horses. The expedition was a failure, reaching no farther than Colombia before succumbing to bad weather, hunger and skirmishes with hostile locals, where Almagro lost an eye. The place names bestowed along their route, ', Puerto deseado',  (desired port), ', Puerto del hambre',  (port of hunger) and ', Puerto quemado', u" (burned port), attest to the difficulties of their journey. Two years later they began a second expedition with reluctant permission from the Governor of Panama. In August 1526, they left with two ships, 160 men and several horses. Upon reaching San Juan River they separated, Pizarro staying to explore the swampy coasts and Almagro sent back for reinforcements. Pizarro's main pilot sailed south and, after crossing the equator, captured a raft from ", Tumbes', . To his surprise, it carried textiles, ceramic and much-desired ', gold', , ', silver', , and ', emeralds', , becoming the central focus of the expedition. Soon Almagro joined with reinforcements and they resumed. After a difficult voyage facing strong winds and currents, they reached ', Atacames',  where they found a large native population under ', Inca',  rule, but they did not land.', 
', Pizarro remained safe near the coast, while Almagro and Luque went back for reinforcements with proof of the ', rumored gold', . The new governor outright rejected a third expedition and ordered two ships to bring everyone back to Panama. Almagro and Luque grasped the opportunity to join Pizarro. When they arrived at the ', Isla de Gallo', , Pizarro drew a line in the sand, saying: ', "There lies Peru with its riches; Here, Panama and its poverty. Choose, each man, what best becomes a brave Castilian."',  Thirteen men decided to stay and became known as ', The Famous Thirteen', . They headed for ', La Isla Gorgona', , where they remained for seven months before the arrival of provisions.', 
', They decided to sail south and, by April 1528, reached the northwestern Peruvian ', Tumbes Region',  and were warmly received by local ', Tumpis', u". Two of Pizarro's men reported incredible riches, including gold and silver decorations around the chief's house. They saw for the first time a ", llama',  which Pizarro called "little camels". The natives named the Spanish "Children of the Sun" for their fair complexion and brilliant armors. They decided then to return to Panama to prepare a final expedition. Before leaving they sailed south through territories they named such as Cabo Blanco, port of Payta, Sechura, Punta de Aguja, Santa Cruz, and ', Trujillo', , reaching the ninth degree south.', 
', In the spring of 1528 Pizarro sailed for Spain, where he had an interview with king ', Charles I', . The king heard of his expeditions in lands rich in gold and silver and promised to support him.

Pizarro was then able to convince many friends and relatives to join: his brothers ', Hernándo Pizarro', , ', Juan Pizarro', , ', Gonzalo Pizarro',  and also ', Francisco de Orellana', , who would later explore the ', Amazon River', , as well as his cousin ', Pedro Pizarro', .', 
', u"Pizarro's third and final expedition left Panama for Peru on 27 December 1530.

Since the last meeting, the Inca had begun a ', civil war',  and ', Atahualpa',  had been resting in northern Peru following the defeat of his brother ', Huáscar', . After marching for two months, they approached Atahualpa. He refused the Spanish, however, saying he would "be no man's tributary." There were fewer than 200 Spanish to his 80,000 soldiers, but Pizarro attacked and won the Incan army in the ', Battle of Cajamarca', , taking Atahualpa captive at the so-called ', ransom room', . Despite fulfilling his promise of filling one room with gold and two with silver, he was convicted for killing his brother and plotting against Pizarro, and was executed.',

If in the Atlantic, ships made the ', Volta do mar',  to pick up winds that would bring them back from Madeira, then, he reasoned, by sailing far to the north before heading east, he would pick up trade winds to bring him back to North America.

', The emergence of Dutch maritime power was swift and remarkable: for years Dutch sailors had participated in Portuguese voyages to the east, as able seafarers and keen mapmakers.

Barentsz reached ', Novaya Zemlya',  and, to avoid becoming entrapped in ice, headed for the ', Vaigatch Strait',  but became stuck within the icebergs and floes. Stranded, the 16-man crew was forced to spend the winter on the ice. The crew used lumber from their ship to build a lodge they called ', Het Behouden Huys',  (The Kept House). Dealing with extreme cold, they used the merchant fabrics to make additional blankets and clothing and caught ', Arctic foxes',  in primitive traps, as well as polar bears. When June arrived, and the ice had still not loosened its grip on the ship, ', scurvy', -ridden survivors took two small boats out into the sea. Barentsz died at sea on 20 June 1597, while studying charts. It took seven more weeks for the boats to reach ', Kola', u" where they were rescued by a Russian merchant vessel. Only 12 crewmen remained, reaching Amsterdam in November.

', In the early 17th century the eastward movement of Russians was slowed by the internal problems in the country during the ', Time of Troubles', . However, very soon the exploration and colonization of the huge territories of Siberia was resumed, led mostly by Cossacks hunting for valuable ', furs',  and ', ivory', . While ', Cossacks',  came from the Southern Urals, another wave of Russians came by the Arctic Ocean. These were ', Pomors',  from the ', Russian North', , who already had been making ', fur',  trade with ', Mangazeya',  in the north of the Western Siberia for quite a long time. In 1607 the settlement of ', Turukhansk',  was founded on the northern ', Yenisei River', , near the mouth of ', Lower Tunguska', , and in 1619 ', Yeniseysky',  ', ostrog',  was founded on the mid-Yenisei at the mouth of the ', Upper Tunguska', .', 
', Between 1620 and 1624 a group of fur hunters led by ', Demid Pyanda',  left ', Turukhansk',  and explored some 1,430 miles (2,301 kilometres) of the Lower Tunguska, wintering in the proximity of the ', Vilyuy',  and ', Lena',  rivers. According to later legendary accounts (folktales collected a century after the fact), Pyanda discovered the Lena River. He allegedly explored some 1,500 miles (2,414 kilometres) of its length, reaching as far as central ', Yakutia', . He returned up the Lena until it became too rocky and shallow, and portaged to the ', Angara River', . In this way, Pyanda may have become the first Russian to meet ', Yakuts',  and ', Buryats', . He built new boats and explored some 870 miles (1,400 kilometres) of the Angara, finally reaching Yeniseysk and discovering that the Angara (a ', Buryat',  name) and ', Upper Tunguska',  (Verkhnyaya Tunguska, as initially known by Russians) are one and the same river.', 
', In 1627 ', Pyotr Beketov',  was appointed Yenisei ', voevoda',  in ', Siberia', . He successfully carried out the voyage to collect taxes from ', Zabaykalye',  Buryats, becoming the first Russian to step in ', Buryatia', . He founded the first Russian settlement there, Rybinsky ostrog. Beketov was sent to the Lena River in 1631, where in 1632 he founded ', Yakutsk',  and sent his Cossacks to explore the ', Aldan',  and farther down the Lena, to found new fortresses, and to collect taxes.', [134]', 
', Yakutsk soon turned into a major starting point for further Russian expeditions eastward, southward and northward. ', Maksim Perfilyev', , who earlier had been one of the founders of Yeniseysk, founded ', Bratsky',  ostrog on the Angara in 1631, and in 1638 he became the first Russian to step into ', Transbaikalia', , travelling there from Yakutsk.', [135]', [136]',

The Cossacks learned from the locals about the large ', Amur River',  far to the south. In 1640 they apparently sailed south, explored the south-eastern shores of the Okhotsk Sea, perhaps reaching the mouth of the ', Amur River',  and possibly discovering the ', Shantar Islands', u" on their way back.

He sailed down the Amur and finally discovered the mouth of that great river from land. Since his Cossacks provoked the enmity of the locals behind, Poyarkov chose a different way back. They built boats and in 1645 sailed along the ', Sea of Okhotsk',  coast to the ', Ulya River',  and spent the next winter in the huts that had been built by ', Ivan Moskvitin',  six years earlier.

All their kochi and most of their men (including Popov himself) were lost in storms and clashes with the natives. A small group led by Dezhnyov reached the mouth of the ', Anadyr River',  and sailed up it in 1649, having built new boats from the wreckage. They founded ', Anadyrsk',  and were stranded there, until Stadukhin found them, coming from Kolyma by land.', [138]',  Subsequently, Stadukhin set off south in 1651 and discovered ', Penzhin Bay',  on the northern coast of the ', Okhotsk Sea', . He also may have explored the western shores of ', Kamchatka', .', 
', In 1649\u201350 ', Yerofey Khabarov',  became the second Russian to explore the ', Amur River', .

He built winter quarters at ', Albazin', , then sailed down Amur and found Achansk, which preceded the present-day ', Khabarovsk', , defeating or evading large armies of ', Daurian',  ', Manch,  Chinese and ', Koreans',  on his way. He charted the Amur in his ', Draft of the Amur river', .', [139]',  Subsequently, Russians held on to the Amur Region until 1689, when by the ', Treaty of Nerchinsk',  this land was assigned to ', Chinese Empire',  (it was returned, however, by the ', Treaty of Aigun',  in 1858).', 
', In 1659\u201365 ', Kurbat Ivanov',  was the next head of ', Anadyrsky',  ostrog after ', Semyon Dezhnyov', . In 1660 he sailed from ', Anadyr Bay',  to ', Cape Dezhnyov', .

', So, by the mid-17th century, Russians established the borders of their country close to modern ones, and explored almost the whole of Siberia, except the eastern ', Kamchatka',  and some regions north of the Arctic Circle. The conquest of Kamchatka later would be achieved in the early 1700-s by ', Vladimir Atlasov', , while the discovery of the Arctic coastline and Alaska would be completed by the ', Great Northern Expedition',  in 1733\u20131743.',

', The new trans-oceanic links and their domination by the European powers led to the ', Age of Imperialism', , where European colonial powers came to control most of the planet. The European appetite for trade, commodities, empire and slaves greatly affected many other areas of the world. Spain participated in the destruction of aggressive empires in the Americas, only to substitute its own, and forcibly replaced the original religions. The pattern of territorial aggression was repeated by other European empires, most notably the Dutch, Russian, French and British. Christianity replaced older "pagan" rituals, as were new languages, political and sexual cultures, and in some areas like North America, Australia, New Zealand and ', Argentina', , the ', indigenous peoples',  were abused and driven off most of their lands, being reduced to small, dependent minorities.',

Trade with ', European powers',  and the Japanese brought in massive amounts of silver, which then replaced copper and paper ', banknotes',  as the common ', medium of exchange',  in China. During the last decades of the Ming the flow of silver into China was greatly diminished, thereby undermining state revenues and indeed the entire Ming economy. This damage to the economy was compounded by the effects on agriculture of the incipient ', Little Ice Age', u", natural calamities, crop failure, and sudden epidemics.

', The arrival of the Portuguese to Japan in 1543 initiated the ', Nanban trade period', , with the Japanese adopting several technologies and cultural practices, like the ', arquebus', , European-style cuirasses, European ships, Christianity, decorative art, and language. After the Chinese had banned direct trade by Chinese merchants with Japan, the Portuguese filled this commercial vacuum as intermediaries between China and Japan. The Portuguese bought Chinese silk and sold it to the Japanese in return for Japanese-mined silver; since silver was more highly valued in China, the Portuguese could then use Japanese silver to buy even larger stocks of Chinese silk.', [151]',  However, by 1573\u2014after the Spanish established a trading base in Manila\u2014the Portuguese intermediary trade was trumped by the prime source of incoming silver to China from the Spanish Americas.', [152]',

With many foreign merchants resident in the city and governed by an oligarchy of banker-aristocrats forbidden to engage in trade, the economy of Antwerp was foreigner-controlled, which made the city very international, with merchants and traders from ', Venice', , ', Ragusa', , Spain and Portugal and a policy of toleration, which attracted a large ', Orthodox Jewish',  community. The city experienced three booms during its golden age, the first based on the pepper market, a second launched by New World silver coming from Seville (ending with the bankruptcy of Spain in 1557), and a third boom, after the ', Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis', , in 1559, based on the textiles industry.',

', The ', Age of Discovery',  or the ', Age of Exploration',  from the end of the ', 15th century',  to the ', 18th century', , was an informal and loosely defined ', European',  ', historical period',  marking the time period in which extensive overseas exploration emerged as a powerful factor in ', European culture',  and the beginning of ', globalization', . It also marks the rise of the period of widespread belief in Europe of the philosophies of ', Colonialism',  and ', Mercantilism', . Many lands previously unknown to Europeans were discovered during this period, though most were already inhabited. From the perspective of many non-Europeans, the age of discovery marked the arrival of settlers and invaders from a previously unknown continent.', 
', Global exploration started with the ', Portuguese discoveries',  of the ', Atlantic',  ', archipelagos',  of ', Madeira',  and the ', Azores', , the coast of ', Africa', , and the ', discovery of the sea route to India',  in 1498; and, on behalf of the ', Crown of Castile',  (Spain), the trans-Atlantic ', Voyages of Christopher Columbus',  between 1492 and 1502, and the first ', circumnavigation of the globe',  in 1519\u20131522. These discoveries led to numerous naval expeditions across the Atlantic, ', Indian',  and ', Pacific',  oceans, and land expeditions in the ', Americas', , ', Asia', , ', Africa', , and ', Australia',  that continued into the late ', 19th century', , and ended with the exploration of the polar regions in the ', 20th century', .', 
', European overseas exploration led to the rise of global trade and the European ', colonial empires', , with the contact between the ', Old World',  (Europe, Asia and Africa) and the ', New World',  (the Americas and Australia) producing the ', Columbian Exchange', : a wide transfer of plants, animals, food, human populations (including ', slaves', ), ', communicable diseases',  and culture between the ', Eastern',  and ', Western',  ', Hemispheres', . This represented one of the most-significant ', global',  events concerning ecology, agriculture, and culture in history. The Age of Discovery and later ', European exploration',  allowed the global mapping of the world, resulting in a new world-view and distant civilizations coming into contact, but also led to the propagation of diseases that decimated populations not previously in contact with Eurasia and Africa, and to the enslavement, exploitation, military conquest, and economic dominance of Europe and its colonies over native populations. It also allowed for the expansion of ', Christianity', u" throughout the world with the spread of missionary activity, becoming the world's largest religion.", [1]', [2]',

', The Portuguese began systematically exploring the Atlantic coast of Africa from 1418, under the sponsorship of ', Prince Henry', u". Under Henry's direction, a new and much lighter ship was developed, the ", caravel', , which could sail further and faster,', [3]',  and, above all, was highly manoeuvrable and could sail much nearer the wind, or ', into the wind', . In 1488 ', Bartolomeu Dias',  reached the Indian Ocean by this route.', [4]',  In 1492 the ', Catholic Monarchs',  of Castile and ', Aragon',  funded ', Christopher Columbus', u"'s plan to sail west to reach the Indies by crossing the Atlantic. He landed on a continent uncharted by Europeans and seen as a ", new world', , the Americas. To prevent conflict between Portugal and Castile (the crown under which Columbus made the voyage), the ', Treaty of Tordesillas',  was signed dividing the world into two regions of exploration, where each had exclusive rights to claim newly discovered lands.', [5]', [6]', 
', In 1498, a Portuguese expedition commanded by ', Vasco da Gama',  reached India by sailing around Africa, opening up direct trade with Asia.', [7]',  While other exploratory fleets were sent from Portugal to northern North America, in the following years ', Portuguese India Armadas',  also extended this Eastern oceanic route, touching sometimes South America and by this way opening a circuit from the New World to Asia (starting in 1500, under the command of ', Pedro Alvares Cabral', ), and explored islands in the South Atlantic and Southern Indian Oceans. Soon, the Portuguese sailed further eastward, to the valuable ', spice islands',  in 1512, landing in China one year later. In 1513, Spanish ', Vasco Núñez de Balboa',  crossed the ', Isthmus of Panama',  and reached the "other sea" from the New World. Thus, Europe first received news of the eastern and western Pacific within a one-year span around 1512. East and west exploration overlapped in 1522, when a Castilian (Spanish) expedition, led by Portuguese navigator ', Ferdinand Magellan',  and later by Spanish Basque navigator ', Juan Sebastián Elcano', , sailing Westward, completed the first circumnavigation of the world,', [8]',  while Spanish ', conquistadors',  explored the inland of the Americas, and later, some of the South Pacific islands.', 
', Since 1495, the French and English and, much later, the ', Dutch',  entered the race of exploration after learning of these exploits, defying the Iberian monopoly on maritime trade by searching for new routes, first to the western coasts of North and South America, through the first English and French expeditions (starting with the first expedition of ', John Cabot',  in 1497 to the north, in the service of England, followed by the French expeditions to South America and later to North America), and into the Pacific Ocean around South America, but eventually by following the Portuguese around Africa into the Indian Ocean; discovering Australia in 1606, New Zealand in 1642, and Hawaii in 1778. Meanwhile, from the 1580s to the 1640s Russians explored and conquered almost the whole of ', Siberia', , and Alaska in the 1730s.',

', European medieval knowledge about Asia beyond the reach of the ', Byzantine Empire',  was sourced in partial reports, often obscured by legends,', [9]',  dating back from the time of the conquests of ', Alexander the Great',  and his successors. Another source was the ', Radhanite Jewish trade networks',  of merchants established as go-betweens between Europe and the Muslim world during the time of the ', Crusader states', .', 
', In 1154, the ', Arab geographer',  ', Muhammad al-Idrisi',  created a description of the world and a ', world map', , the ', Tabula Rogeriana', , at the court of King ', Roger II of Sicily', ,', [10]', [11]',  but still Africa was only partially known to either Christians, Genoese and Venetians, or the Arab seamen, and its southern extent unknown. There were reports of great African ', Sahara', , but the factual knowledge was limited for the Europeans to the Mediterranean coasts and little else since the Arab blockade of North Africa precluded exploration inland. Knowledge about the Atlantic African coast was fragmented and derived mainly from ', old',  Greek and Roman maps based on Carthaginian knowledge, including the time of ', Roman',  exploration of ', Mauritania', . The ', Red Sea',  was barely known and only trade links with the ', Maritime republics', , the ', Republic of Venice',  especially, fostered collection of accurate maritime knowledge.', [12]', 
', Indian Ocean trade routes were sailed by Arab traders. Between 1405 and 1421, the ', Yongle Emperor',  of ', Ming China',  sponsored a series of long range ', tributary missions',  under the command of ', Zheng He',  (Cheng Ho).', [13]',  The fleets visited ', Arabia', , ', East Africa', , ', India', , ', Maritime Southeast Asia',  and ', Thailand', . But the journeys, reported by ', Ma Huan', , a ', Muslim', u" voyager and translator, were halted abruptly after the emperor's death", [14]',  and were not followed up, as the Chinese ', Ming Dynasty',  retreated in the ', haijin', , a policy of ', isolationism', , having limited maritime trade.', 
', By 1400 a Latin translation of ', Ptolemy', u"'s ", Geographia',  reached Italy coming from Constantinople. The rediscovery of Roman geographical knowledge was a revelation,', [15]',  both for mapmaking and worldview,', [16]',  although reinforcing the idea that the Indian Ocean was landlocked.',

', A prelude to the Age of Discovery was a series of European expeditions crossing ', Eurasia',  by land in the late Middle Ages.', [17]',  Although the ', Mongols',  had threatened Europe with pillage and destruction,', [', clarification needed', ]',  Mongol states also unified much of Eurasia and, from 1206 on, the ', Pax Mongolica',  allowed safe trade routes and communication lines stretching from the Middle East to China.', [18]', [19]',  A series of Europeans took advantage of these to explore eastwards. Most were Italians, as trade between Europe and the Middle East was controlled mainly by the ', Maritime republics', .', [', citation needed', ]',  The close ', Italian',  links to the ', Levant',  raised great curiosity and commercial interest in countries which lay further east.', [', citation needed', ]', 
', Christian embassies were sent as far as ', Karakorum',  during the ', Mongol invasions of Syria', , from which they gained a greater understanding of the world.', [', citation needed', ]',  The first of these travelers was ', Giovanni da Pian del Carpine', , dispatched by ', Pope Innocent IV',  to the ', Great Khan', , who journeyed to ', Mongolia',  and back from 1241 to 1247.', [18]',  About the same time, Russian prince ', Yaroslav of Vladimir', , and subsequently his sons ', Alexander Nevsky',  and ', Andrey II of Vladimir', , traveled to the Mongolian capital.

', Muslim traders\u2014mainly descendants of Arab sailors from ', Yemen',  and ', Oman', \u2014dominated maritime routes throughout the Indian Ocean, tapping source regions in the Far East and shipping for trading emporiums in India, mainly ', Kozhikode', , westward to ', Ormus',  in the ', Persian Gulf',  and ', Jeddah',  in the ', Red Sea', . From there, overland routes led to the Mediterranean coasts. Venetian merchants distributed the goods through Europe until the rise of the ', Ottoman Empire', , that eventually led to the ', fall of Constantinople',  in 1453, barring Europeans from important combined-land-sea routes.', [33]', [34]', 
', Forced to reduce their activities in the Black Sea, and at war with Venice, the ', Genoese',  had turned to North African trade of wheat, ', olive oil',  (valued also as an energy source) and a search for silver and gold.

', In 1478 (during the War of the Castilian Succession), near the coast at Elmina was fought a large battle between a Castilian armada of 35 caravels and a Portuguese fleet for hegemony of the Guinea trade (gold, slaves, ivory and melegueta pepper).

', u"Portugal's neighbouring fellow Iberian rival, ", Castile', , had begun to establish its rule over the ', Canary Islands', , located off the west African coast, in 1402, but then became distracted by internal Iberian politics and the repelling of Islamic invasion attempts and raids through most of the 15th century. Only late in the century, following the unification of the crowns of Castile and Aragon and the completion of the ', reconquista', , did an emerging modern Spain become fully committed to the search for new trade routes overseas. The ', Crown of Aragon',  had been an important maritime potentate in the Mediterranean, controlling territories in eastern Spain, southwestern France, major islands like ', Sicily', , ', Malta', , and the ', Kingdom of Naples',  and ', Sardinia', , with mainland possessions as far as Greece. In 1492 the ', joint rulers',  conquered the ', Moorish kingdom of Granada', , which had been providing Castile with African goods through tribute, and decided to fund ', Christopher Columbus', 's expedition in the hope of bypassing Portugal's monopoly on west African sea routes, to reach "the Indies" (east and south Asia) by travelling west.', [59]',  Twice before, in 1485 and 1488, Columbus had presented the project to king ', John II of Portugal', , who rejected it.', 
', On the evening of 3 August 1492, Columbus departed from ', Palos de la Frontera',  with three ships; one larger ', carrack', , ', Santa María', , nicknamed ', Gallega',  (', the Galician', ), and two smaller ', caravels', , ', Pinta',  (', the Painted', ) and ', Santa Clara', , nicknamed ', Niña', .

', Shortly after Columbus's return from what would later be called the "West Indies", a division of influence became necessary to avoid conflict between the Spanish and Portuguese.', [63]', u" On 4 May 1493, two months after Columbus's arrival, the ", Catholic Monarchs',  received a ', bull',  (', Inter caetera', ) from ', Pope Alexander VI',  stating that all lands west and south of a pole-to-pole line 100 leagues west and south of the ', Azores',  or the Cape Verde Islands should belong to Castile and, later, all mainlands and islands then belonging to India. It did not mention Portugal, which could not claim newly discovered lands east of the line.', 
', King ', John II of Portugal',  was not pleased with the arrangement, feeling that it gave him far too little land\u2014preventing him from reaching India, his main goal. He then negotiated directly with King ', Ferdinand',  and Queen ', Isabella',  of Spain to move the line west, and allowing him to claim newly discovered lands east of it.', [64]', 
', An agreement was reached in 1494, with the ', Treaty of Tordesillas',  that divided the world between the two powers. In this treaty the Portuguese received everything outside Europe east of a line that ran 370 ', leagues',  west of the ', Cape Verde',  islands (already Portuguese), and the islands discovered by ', Christopher Columbus',  on his first voyage (claimed for Spain), named in the treaty as ', Cipang,  and ', Antilia',  (', Cuba',  and ', Hispaniola', ). This gave them control over Africa, Asia and eastern South America (Brazil). The Spanish (Castile) received everything west of this line. At the time of negotiation, the treaty split the known world of Atlantic islands roughly in half, with the dividing line about halfway between Portuguese Cape Verde and the Spanish discoveries in the Caribbean.', 
', Pedro Álvares Cabral',  encountered in 1500 what is now known as the Brazilian coast, originally thought to be a large island. Since it was east of the dividing line, he claimed it for Portugal and this was respected by the Spanish. Portuguese ships sailed west into the Atlantic to get favorable winds for the journey to India, and this is where Cabral was headed on his journey, in a corridor the treaty was negotiated to protect. Some suspect the Portuguese had secretly discovered Brazil earlier, and this is why they had the line moved eastward and how Cabral found it, but there is no reliable evidence of this. Others suspect ', Duarte Pacheco Pereira',  secretly discovered Brazil in 1498, but this not considered credible by mainstream historians.', 
', Later the Spanish territory would prove to include huge areas of the continental mainland of North and South America, though Portuguese-controlled Brazil would expand across the line, and settlements by other European powers ignored the treaty.',

In 1499 ', João Fernandes Lavrador',  was licensed by the King of Portugal and together with ', Pêro de Barcelos',  they first sighted ', Labrador', , which was granted and named after him. After returning he possibly went to Bristol to sail in the name of England.', [66]',  Nearly at the same time, between 1499 and 1502 brothers ', Gaspar',  and ', Miguel Corte Real',  explored and named the coasts of ', Greenland',  and also Newfoundland.', [67]',  Both explorations are noted in the 1502 ', Cantino planisphere', .', 
', The "True Indies" and Brazil', [', edit', ]', 
', In 1497, newly crowned King ', Manuel I of Portugal',  sent an exploratory fleet eastwards, fulfilling his predecessor's project of finding a route to the Indies. In July 1499 news spread that the Portuguese had reached the "true indies", as a letter was dispatched by the Portuguese king to the Spanish Catholic Monarchs one day after the celebrated return of the fleet.', [68]', 
', The third expedition by Columbus in 1498 was the beginning of the first successful Castilian (Spanish) colonization in the ', West Indies', , on the island of Hispaniola. Despite growing doubts, Columbus refused to accept that he had not reached the Indies. During the voyage he discovered the mouth of the ', Orinoco River',  on the north coast of South America (now Venezuela) and thought that the huge quantity of fresh water coming from it could only be from a continental land mass, which he was certain was the Asian mainland.', 
', As shipping between ', Seville',  and the West Indies grew, knowledge of the Caribbean islands, Central America and the northern coast of South America grew. One of these Spanish fleets, that of ', Alonso de Ojeda',  and ', Amerigo Vespucci',  in 1499\u20131500, reached land at the coast of what is now ', Guyana', , when the two explorers seem to have separated in opposite directions. Vespucci sailed southward, discovering the mouth of the ', Amazon River',  in July 1499,', [69]', [70]',  and reaching 6°S, in present-day north east ', Brazil', , before turning around.', 
', In the beginning of 1500 ', Vicente Yáñez Pinzon',  was blown off course by a storm and reached what is now the north east coast of Brazil on 26 January 1500, exploring as far south as the present-day state of ', Pernambuco', . His fleet was the first to fully enter the Amazon River estuary which he named ', Río Santa María de la Mar Dulce',  (', u"Saint Mary's River of the Sweet Sea", ).', [71]',  However, the land was too far east for the Castilians to claim under the Treaty of Tordesillas, but the discovery created Castilian (', Spanish', ) interest, with a second voyage by Pinzon in 1508 (an expedition that coasted the northern coast to the Central American coastal mainland, in search of a passage to the East) and a voyage in 1515\u201316 by a navigator of the 1508 expedition, ', Juan Díaz de Solís', . The 1515\u201316 expedition was spurred on by reports of Portuguese exploration of the region (see below). It ended when de Solís and some of his crew disappeared when exploring a ', River Plate',  river in a boat, but what it found re-ignited Spanish interest, and colonization began in 1531.', 
', In April 1500, the ', second Portuguese India Armada', , headed by ', Pedro Álvares Cabral', , with a crew of expert captains, including Bartolomeu Dias and ', Nicolau Coelho', , encountered the Brazilian coast as it swung westward in the Atlantic while performing a large "', volta do mar', " to avoid becalming in the ', Gulf of Guinea', . On 21 April 1500 a mountain was seen and was named ', Monte Pascoal', , and on the 22nd of April Cabral landed on the coast. On 25 April the entire fleet sailed into the harbor they named ', Porto Seguro',  (Port Secure). Cabral perceived that the new land lay east of the line of Tordesillas, and sent an envoy to Portugal with the discovery in letters, including the ', letter',  of ', Pero Vaz de Caminha', . Believing the land to be an island, he named it ', Ilha de Vera Cruz',  (Island of the True Cross).', [72]',  Some historians have suggested that the Portuguese may have encountered the South American bulge earlier while sailing the "volta do mar", hence the insistence of John II in moving the line west of Tordesillas in 1494\u2014so his landing in Brazil may not have been an accident; although John's motivation may have simply been to increase the chance of claiming new lands in the Atlantic.', [73]',  From the east coast, the fleet then turned eastward to resume the journey to the southern tip of Africa and India. Cabral was the first captain to touch four continents, leading the first expedition that connected and united Europe, Africa, the New World, and Asia.', [74]', [75]', 
', At the invitation of King Manuel I of Portugal, Amerigo Vespucci ', [76]',  \u2014 a Florentine who had been working for a branch of the ', Medici Bank',  in ', Seville',  since 1491, fitting oceanic expeditions and travelling twice to ', The Guianas',  with ', Juan de la Cosa',  in the service of Spain', [77]',  \u2014 participated as observer in these exploratory voyages to the east coast of South America. The expeditions became widely known in Europe after two accounts attributed to him, published between 1502 and 1504, suggested that the newly discovered lands were not the Indies but a "', New World', ",', [78]',  the ', Mundus novus', , Latin title of a contemporary document based on Vespucci letters to ', u"Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici", , which had become widely popular in Europe.', [79]',  It was soon understood that Columbus had not reached Asia but had found a new continent, the Americas. ', The Americas were named',  in 1507 by ', cartographers',  ', Martin Waldseemüller',  and ', Matthias Ringmann', , probably after Amerigo Vespucci.', 
', In 1501\u20131502, one of these Portuguese expeditions, led by ', Gonçalo Coelho',  (and/or ', André Gonçalves',  or ', Gaspar de Lemos', ), sailed south along the coast of South America to the bay of present-day ', Rio de Janeiro', . Amerigo Vespucci's account states that the expedition reached the latitude "South Pole elevation 52° S", in the "cold" latitudes of what is now southern ', Patagonia',  (possibly near the Strait), before turning back. Vespucci wrote that they headed toward the southwest and south, following "a long, unbending coastline" (apparently coincident with the southern South American coast). This seems controversial, since he changed part of his description in the subsequent letter, stating a shift, from about 32° S (Southern Brazil), to south-southeast, to open sea; maintaining, however, that they reached 50°/52° S (if it was by his own decision or by D. Manuel's censors who had to pressure him to alter his account, because he had revealed far too much to Lorenzo de' Medici and into the public domain, is unknown).', [80]', [81]',

The place names bestowed along their route, ', Puerto deseado',  (desired port), ', Puerto del hambre',  (port of hunger) and ', Puerto quemado', u" (burned port), attest to the difficulties of their journey. Two years later they began a second expedition with reluctant permission from the Governor of Panama. In August 1526, they left with two ships, 160 men and several horses. Upon reaching San Juan River they separated, Pizarro staying to explore the swampy coasts and Almagro sent back for reinforcements.

If in the Atlantic, ships made the ', Volta do mar',  to pick up winds that would bring them back from Madeira, then, he reasoned, by sailing far to the north before heading east, he would pick up trade winds to bring him back to North America.

', France, the Netherlands, and England were left without a sea route to Asia, either via Africa or South America.

The desire to establish such a route motivated much of the European exploration of both coasts of North America and in Russia. In Russia the idea of a possible seaway connecting the Atlantic and the Pacific was first put forward by the diplomat ', Gerasimov',  in 1525, although Russian settlers on the coast of the ', White Sea', , the ', Pomors', , had been exploring parts of the route as early as the 11th century.',

Stranded, the 16-man crew was forced to spend the winter on the ice. The crew used lumber from their ship to build a lodge they called ', Het Behouden Huys',  (The Kept House). Dealing with extreme cold, they used the merchant fabrics to make additional blankets and clothing and caught ', Arctic foxes',  in primitive traps, as well as polar bears. When June arrived, and the ice had still not loosened its grip on the ship, ', scurvy', -ridden survivors took two small boats out into the sea. Barentsz died at sea on 20 June 1597, while studying charts. It took seven more weeks for the boats to reach ', Kola', u" where they were rescued by a Russian merchant vessel.

', In the early 17th century the eastward movement of Russians was slowed by the internal problems in the country during the ', Time of Troubles', . However, very soon the exploration and colonization of the huge territories of Siberia was resumed, led mostly by Cossacks hunting for valuable ', furs',  and ', ivory', . While ', Cossacks',  came from the Southern Urals, another wave of Russians came by the Arctic Ocean. These were ', Pomors',  from the ', Russian North', , who already had been making ', fur',  trade with ', Mangazeya',  in the north of the Western Siberia for quite a long time. In 1607 the settlement of ', Turukhansk',  was founded on the northern ', Yenisei River', , near the mouth of ', Lower Tunguska', , and in 1619 ', Yeniseysky',  ', ostrog',  was founded on the mid-Yenisei at the mouth of the ', Upper Tunguska', .', 
', Between 1620 and 1624 a group of fur hunters led by ', Demid Pyanda',  left ', Turukhansk',  and explored some 1,430 miles (2,301 kilometres) of the Lower Tunguska, wintering in the proximity of the ', Vilyuy',  and ', Lena',  rivers. According to later legendary accounts (folktales collected a century after the fact), Pyanda discovered the Lena River. He allegedly explored some 1,500 miles (2,414 kilometres) of its length, reaching as far as central ', Yakutia', . He returned up the Lena until it became too rocky and shallow, and portaged to the ', Angara River', . In this way, Pyanda may have become the first Russian to meet ', Yakuts',  and ', Buryats', . He built new boats and explored some 870 miles (1,400 kilometres) of the Angara, finally reaching Yeniseysk and discovering that the Angara (a ', Buryat',  name) and ', Upper Tunguska',  (Verkhnyaya Tunguska, as initially known by Russians) are one and the same river.', 
', In 1627 ', Pyotr Beketov',  was appointed Yenisei ', voevoda',  in ', Siberia', . He successfully carried out the voyage to collect taxes from ', Zabaykalye',  Buryats, becoming the first Russian to step in ', Buryatia', .

All their kochi and most of their men (including Popov himself) were lost in storms and clashes with the natives. A small group led by Dezhnyov reached the mouth of the ', Anadyr River',  and sailed up it in 1649, having built new boats from the wreckage. They founded ', Anadyrsk',  and were stranded there, until Stadukhin found them, coming from Kolyma by land.', [138]',  Subsequently, Stadukhin set off south in 1651 and discovered ', Penzhin Bay',  on the northern coast of the ', Okhotsk Sea', . He also may have explored the western shores of ', Kamchatka', .',

', So, by the mid-17th century, Russians established the borders of their country close to modern ones, and explored almost the whole of Siberia, except the eastern ', Kamchatka',  and some regions north of the Arctic Circle. The conquest of Kamchatka later would be achieved in the early 1700-s by ', Vladimir Atlasov', , while the discovery of the Arctic coastline and Alaska would be completed by the ', Great Northern Expedition',  in 1733\u20131743.',

', European overseas expansion led to the contact between the Old and New Worlds producing the ', Columbian Exchange', ,', [140]',  named after Columbus. It involved the transfer of goods unique to one hemisphere to another. Europeans brought ', cattle', , ', horses', , and ', sheep',  to the New World, and from the New World Europeans received ', tobacco', , ', potatoes',  and ', maize', . Other items becoming important in global trade were the ', sugarcane',  and ', cotton',  crops of the Americas, and the gold and silver brought from the Americas not only to Europe but elsewhere in the Old World.', 
', The new trans-oceanic links and their domination by the European powers led to the ', Age of Imperialism', , where European colonial powers came to control most of the planet. The European appetite for trade, commodities, empire and slaves greatly affected many other areas of the world. Spain participated in the destruction of aggressive empires in the Americas, only to substitute its own, and forcibly replaced the original religions. The pattern of territorial aggression was repeated by other European empires, most notably the Dutch, Russian, French and British. Christianity replaced older "pagan" rituals, as were new languages, political and sexual cultures, and in some areas like North America, Australia, New Zealand and ', Argentina', , the ', indigenous peoples',  were abused and driven off most of their lands, being reduced to small, dependent minorities.',

(See ', Atlantic slave trade', ).', 
', Aboriginal peoples were living in North America at this time and still do today. There were many conflicts between Europeans and Natives. The Europeans had many advantages over the natives. They gave them diseases that they had not been exposed to before and this wiped out 50\u201390% of their population. (See ', Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas', .)', [141]', 
', Maize',  and ', manioc',  were introduced into Africa in the 16th century by the Portuguese.', [142]',  They are now important staple foods, replacing native African crops.', [143]', [144]',  ', Alfred W. Crosby',  speculated that increased production of maize, manioc, and other New World crops led to heavier concentrations of population in the areas from which slavers captured their victims.', [145]', 
', In the 16th-century economy of China, the ', Ming Dynasty',  was stimulated by trade with the ', Portuguese', , ', Spanish', , and ', Dutch', . China became involved in a new global trade of goods, plants, animals, and food crops known as the ', Columbian Exchange', . Trade with ', European powers',  and the Japanese brought in massive amounts of silver, which then replaced copper and paper ', banknotes',  as the common ', medium of exchange',  in China. During the last decades of the Ming the flow of silver into China was greatly diminished, thereby undermining state revenues and indeed the entire Ming economy. This damage to the economy was compounded by the effects on agriculture of the incipient ', Little Ice Age', u", natural calamities, crop failure, and sudden epidemics. The ensuing breakdown of authority and people's livelihoods allowed rebel leaders such as ", Li Zicheng',  to challenge ', Ming',  authority.',

', u"New crops that had come to Asia from the Americas via the Spanish colonizers in the 16th century contributed to the Asia's population growth.", [146]',  Although the bulk of imports to China were silver, the Chinese also purchased New World crops from the ', Spanish Empire', . This included ', sweet potatoes', , ', maize', , and ', peanuts', , foods that could be cultivated in lands where traditional Chinese staple crops\u2014wheat, millet, and rice\u2014could not grow, hence facilitating a rise in the population of China.', [147]', [148]',  In the Song Dynasty (960\u20131279), rice had become the major staple crop of the poor;', [149]',  after sweet potatoes were introduced to China around 1560, it gradually became the traditional food of the lower classes.', [150]', 
', The arrival of the Portuguese to Japan in 1543 initiated the ', Nanban trade period', , with the Japanese adopting several technologies and cultural practices, like the ', arquebus', , European-style cuirasses, European ships, Christianity, decorative art, and language. After the Chinese had banned direct trade by Chinese merchants with Japan, the Portuguese filled this commercial vacuum as intermediaries between China and Japan. The Portuguese bought Chinese silk and sold it to the Japanese in return for Japanese-mined silver; since silver was more highly valued in China, the Portuguese could then use Japanese silver to buy even larger stocks of Chinese silk.', [151]',  However, by 1573\u2014after the Spanish established a trading base in Manila\u2014the Portuguese intermediary trade was trumped by the prime source of incoming silver to China from the Spanish Americas.', [152]', 
', Italian Jesuit ', Matteo Ricci',  (1552\u20131610), was the first European allowed into the Forbidden City, taught the Chinese how to construct and play the ', spinet', , translated Chinese texts into Latin and vice versa, and worked closely with his Chinese associate ', Xu Guangqi',  (1562\u20131633) on mathematical work.',

', As a wider variety of global luxury commodities entered the European markets by sea, previous European markets for ', luxury goods',  stagnated. The Atlantic trade largely supplanted pre-existing ', Italian',  and ', German',  trading powers which had relied on their Baltic, Russian and Islamic trade links. The new commodities also caused ', social change', , as sugar, spices, silks and chinawares entered the luxury markets of Europe.', 
', The European economic center shifted from the Mediterranean to Western Europe. The city of ', Antwerp', , part of the ', Duchy of Brabant', , became "the center of the ', entire',  international economy,', [153]',  and the richest city in Europe at this time.', [154]',  Centered in Antwerp first and then in ', Amsterdam', , "', Dutch Golden Age', " was tightly linked to the Age of Discovery. ', Francesco Guicciardini', , a Venetian envoy, stated that hundreds of ships would pass Antwerp in a day, and 2,000 carts entered the city each week. Portuguese ships laden with ', pepper',  and ', cinnamon',  would unload their cargo. With many foreign merchants resident in the city and governed by an oligarchy of banker-aristocrats forbidden to engage in trade, the economy of Antwerp was foreigner-controlled, which made the city very international, with merchants and traders from ', Venice', , ', Ragusa', , Spain and Portugal and a policy of toleration, which attracted a large ', Orthodox Jewish',  community. The city experienced three booms during its golden age, the first based on the pepper market, a second launched by New World silver coming from Seville (ending with the bankruptcy of Spain in 1557), and a third boom, after the ', Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis', , in 1559, based on the textiles industry.', 
', Despite initial hostilities, by 1549 the Portuguese were sending annual trade missions to ', Shangchuan Island',  in China. In 1557 they managed to convince the ', Ming',  court to agree on a legal port treaty that would establish ', Maca,  as an official Portuguese trade colony.', [155]',  The Portuguese friar ', Gaspar da Cruz',  (c. 1520 February 5, 1570) wrote the first complete book on China and the Ming Dynasty that was published in Europe; it included information on its geography, provinces, royalty, official class, bureaucracy, shipping, architecture, farming, craftsmanship, merchant affairs, clothing, religious and social customs, music and instruments, writing, education, and justice.', [156]',

', From China the major exports were ', silk',  and ', porcelain', , adapted to meet European tastes. The ', Chinese export porcelains',  were held in such great esteem in Europe that, in English, ', china',  became a commonly\u2013used synonym for ', porcelain', . ', Kraak porcelain',  (believed to be named after the Portuguese ', carracks',  in which it was transported) was among the first Chinese ware to arrive in Europe in mass quantities. Only the richest could afford these early imports, and Kraak often featured in ', Dutch still life',  paintings.', [157]',  Soon the ', Dutch East India Company',  established a lively trade with the East, having imported 6 million porcelain items from China to Europe between the years 1602 to 1682.', [158]', [159]',  The Chinese workmanship impressed many. Between 1575 and 1587 ', Medici porcelain',  from ', Florence',  was the first successful attempt to imitate Chinese porcelain. Although Dutch potters did not immediately imitate Chinese porcelain, they began to do it when the supply to Europe was interrupted, after the death of ', Wanli Emperor',  in 1620. Kraak, mainly the ', blue and white porcelain', , was imitated all over the world by potters in ', Arita, Japan',  and ', Persia', \u2014 where Dutch merchants turned when the fall of the Ming Dynasty rendered Chinese originals unavailable', [160]', \u2014and ultimately in ', Delftware', . Dutch and later ', English Delftware',  inspired by Chinese designs persisted from about 1630 to the mid-18th century alongside European patterns.',

', Antonio de Morga',  (1559\u20131636), a Spanish official in ', Manila', , listed an extensive inventory of goods that were traded by Ming China at the turn of the 16th to 17th century, noting there were "rarities which, did I refer to them all, I would never finish, nor have sufficient paper for it".', [161]',  After noting the variety of silk goods traded to Europeans, Ebrey writes of the considerable size of commercial transactions: In one case a galleon to the Spanish territories in the New World carried over 50,000 pairs of silk stockings. In return China imported mostly silver from Peruvian and Mexican mines, ', transported via Manila', . Chinese merchants were active in these trading ventures, and many emigrated to such places as the ', Philippines',  and Borneo to take advantage of the new commercial opportunities.', [147]', 
', The increase in wealth experienced by ', Spain',  coincided with a major ', inflationary',  cycle both within Spain and Europe, known as the ', price revolution', . Spain had amassed large quantities of gold and silver from the New World.', [162]', u" In the 1520s large scale extraction of silver from Mexico's ", Guanajuato',  began. With the opening of the silver mines in ', Zacatecas', u" and Bolivia's ", Potosí',  in 1546 large shipments of silver became the fabled source of wealth. During the 16th century, Spain held the equivalent of US$1.5 trillion (1990 terms) in gold and silver from ', New Spain', . Being the most powerful European monarch at a time full of war and religious conflicts, the ', Habsburg',  rulers spent the wealth in wars and arts across Europe. "I learnt a proverb here", said a French traveler in 1603: "Everything is dear in Spain except silver".', [163]',  The spent silver, suddenly spread throughout a previously cash-starved Europe, caused widespread inflation.', [164]', u" The inflation was worsened by a growing population with a static production level, low salaries and a rising cost of living, which damaged local industry. Increasingly, Spain became dependent on the revenues flowing in from the mercantile empire in the Americas, leading to Spain's first bankruptcy in 1557 due to rising military costs.", [165]',  Phillip II of Spain defaulted on debt payments in 1557, 1560, 1575 and 1596. The increase in prices as a result of currency circulation fueled the growth of the commercial ', middle class',  in Europe, the ', bourgeoisie', , which came to influence the politics and culture of many countries.',
