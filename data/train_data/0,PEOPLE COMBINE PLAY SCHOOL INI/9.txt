School Systems are beginning to recognize the \u201c', Multiple Intelligences', \u201d that were introduced to the world of education by Dr. Howard Gardner, in 1983. ', 
', Below you\u2019ll find a brief description of eight of them \u2013 the original seven and one other which has been accepted.  Two more are currently making their debut: ', an Intuitive Intelligence and a Moral Intelligence,',  but not enough is known about these yet, to be able to measure them.  ', 
', 8 TYPES OF MULTIPLE INTELLIGENCES', 
', 
', Linguistic', 
', Logical/Mathematical', 
', Visual/Spatial', 
', Bodily/Kinesthetic>', 
', Musical', 
', Interpersonal', 
', Intrapersonal', 
', Naturalist', 
', 
', 
', 
',  ',  ',  ',  LINGUISTIC INTELLIGENCE', 
\u2013 the ability to use words and language with ease.  These people think in words rather thanaa pictures. They appreciate the subtle shades of meaning among words.  For example they would distinguish between spilling something \u2013 \u201cintentionally\u201d, \u201cdeliberately\u201d or \u201con purpose\u201d.  
', They also have a strong appreciation of the rhythms, and sound of words, and are fascinaated with the different ways they can use language to persuade, entertain, inform, comfort, motivate, manipulate or control others around them.', 
', 
',  ',  ',  LOGICAL/MATHEMATICAL INTELLIGENCE', 
\u2013 the ability to use reason, logic and numbers.  These thinkers are good at seeing patterns and relationships and making connections between pieces of information.  They are critical and relentless questioners.
', They easily grasp the intricacies of complex problems and are attracted to computers and puzzles that draw on their reasoning abilities.  ', 
', They need things to make sense logically and can get quite annoyed when things don\u2019t make sense. They enjoy the challenge of systematically and analytically working through a difficult problem to it\u2019s logical conclusion.', 
', 
',  ',  ',  VISUAL-SPATIAL INTELLIGENCE', 
\u2013 the kind of intelligence you use when you are parallel parking your car on the street. It comes into play, in unfamiliar territory, when you are visualizing or imagining in your mind where you are, so you don\u2019t get lost.  
', This is also the intelligence you use when you are reading a novel, or hearing someone tell a story for the first time.  It creates a movie of the characters and story action in your mind.  ', 
', You often hear people say they were disappointed in the movie version of the story, because it didn\u2019t match the one they had created in their imagination, as they read the book. ', 
', It\u2019s the ability to form a mental 3D model of the spatial world and to manoeuver and operate using that model. ', 
', 
', 
', 
', 
', 
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
', 
', 
',  ',  KINESTHETIC INTELLIGENCE', 
\u2013 the kind of intelligence we use when we are making our bodies do things.  It is especially highly developed in athletes, dancers, gymnasts, circus performers \u2014 people who use the body in precise and exacting ways.  
', For example, those who win at sports, are able to quickly make their bodies move, and do what they can imagine them doing in their minds.  ', 
', Those who are strong on this kind of intelligence are highly paid for their skills as athletes and entertainers. ', 
', Notice that they are combining two kinds of intelligence here: Kinesthetic and Visual-Spatial.', 
', 
',  ',  ',  MUSICAL INTELLIGENCE', 
\u2013 just what it appears to be.  It\u2019s the ability to use sound and make it work for you.  
', Guess which field of work people with a highly developed musical intelligence are likely to be found?  You\u2019ll find them singing, playing in orchestras, bands, writing music, advertising jingles, and so on.  ', 
', These people know how to change the tone of their voice for effect, when speaking, or singing.  ', 
', It also applies to those who can\u2019t hold a note themselves, but know how to appreciate music.  ', 
', Their sensitivity to sound will make them notice non-verbal sounds in the environment that others barely hear: the sounds of nature, the sound of a leaking tap, a buzzing fly, a bird, a lawn mower. ', 
', Discordant sounds in music make them cringe.  They frequently have a song playing in their minds.  They move with a rhythm and learn more easily by hearing a presentation than by reading the same material.  ', 
', 
', 
', 
', 
',

', 
', 
',  ',  ',  INTERPERSONAL INTELLIGENCE', 
\u2013 another familiar multiple intelligence which is easily recognized. People who do well in sales, politics, public speaking, the entertainment industry \u2014 all have a gift for handling people.  
', They may not know how they do it, but they have a highly developed sensitivity or insight into how people feel, and they can use that intelligence to manipulate, persuade, entertain, comfort, please, or control people in negative or positive ways.  ', 
', This intelligence is found in very sociable people who are naturally skilled at working with groups or on teams.', 
', 
',  ',  INTRAPERSONAL INTELLIGENCE ', 
\u2013 has been misunderstood for many years. It gives a person a deep knowing about subtle aspects of people, situations, and things around them. 
', This kind of intelligence is extremely discriminating, noticing any change, and being consciously or unconsciously aware of the inner workings of anyone or anything they come in contact with.  They can express that intelligence through writing, music, art, movement, even through the fields of spiritual and psychic experience.  ', 
', This is the most private of all the multiple intelligences.  They prefer to flow their way through life, sensing and knowing intuitively the best response in any situation.  ', 
', They tend to be quiet, reflective, and not to talk a lot.  They are very much at home in the field of Alternative Health Care, or any type of work that uses their special intelligence.', 
', 
',  ',  NATURALIST INTELLIGENCE ', 
', What kind of work do you think someone with a would be drawn to?  They have a special awareness of nature. They instinctively recognize, understand and appreciate the patterns and relationships they see in nature.  
', They have the ability to pick out details about birds, animals, stones, clouds, trees and plants, that others never see. They understand animals, how the weather works, and can cultivate beautiful gardens.  ', 
', This kind of intelligence is highly developed in people who depend on nature for their survival.  But it is becoming more valued today, now that we are becoming increasingly sensitive to the needs of the natural environment around us.',
