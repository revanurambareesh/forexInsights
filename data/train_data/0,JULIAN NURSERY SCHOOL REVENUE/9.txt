                                    In 2008-09, Pearson Schools took over the management of its first school, an institution
                                    that was literally unknown to the parent community. Ever since we took over the
                                    reins of the school, we have introduced several significant changes. The infrastructure
                                    and the socio-economic profile of the parents seeking admissions have undergone
                                    a substantial improvement resulting in 10 times increase in student strength in
                                    a short span of only 3 years. In addition to a comprehensive curriculum being designed
                                    and implemented, extensive teacher and management training programmes are conducted
                                    to ensure effective governance of the school. In an effort to build an improved
                                    image and gain recognition, uniquely themed and well executed Annual Day and Sports
                                    Day functions are organised every year which draws in parents and children in large
                                    numbers.

                                    Result: The School is now affiliated to CBSE. Post the adjustment of the fee structure
                                    according to the demographic needs, the admissions have increased by 132%.', 
                                ', 
                                    2. DEBT TO PROFIT', 
                                    In 2009-10, Pearson Schools took over the management of an international school
                                    in one of the metros which had a large debt burden, in addition to a negative image
                                    among parents due to poor strength of the school. We began by focussing on extensive
                                    marketing activities to create awareness and curiosity about the school, increase
                                    walk-ins and build the image of the school as one of the best IB schools in the
                                    city. We are continuing our efforts to set right the school documentation and affiliation
                                    details and have appointed Academic Co-ordinator to ensure sustained academic support
                                    and effective leadership. With support from IB and CBSE, we have ensured best practices
                                    from both the streams. Parental involvement', 
                                    has been another main area of focus. Comprehensive teacher training programmes and
                                    workshops are conducted at regular intervals while senior teachers are encouraged
                                    to participate at international workshops.

                                    Result: The school now has IB authorization and IB world status. In less than two
                                    years, the school has witnessed 19% increase in school collections and 38% increase
                                    in student strength',

                                    In 2009-10, Pearson Schools started a school in one of the tier-1 cities in West
                                    India. Being a start-up school, we created a detailed counselling programme for
                                    quick conversion of queries. Qualified teachers were selected through a rigorous
                                    interview process and were given extensive training on the implementation and monitoring
                                    of the academic programme. We ensured that the focus was on small class strength,
                                    digital learning and coscholastics; a good sports program was guaranteed with a
                                    partnership with EduSports. Parents were heavily involved in the child\u2019s school
                                    life, which resulted in generating good word-of-mouth promotion and increased admissions.', 
                                    has been another main area of focus. Comprehensive teacher training programmes and
                                    workshops are conducted at regular intervals while senior teachers are encouraged

                                    Result: In less than two years, the School has grown to strength of 600+ and emerged
                                    as top school of choice in the city.',

                                    In 2009-10, Pearson Schools took over the management of a large school in a metro
                                    in South India which was looking for a partner to take them to the next level and
                                    enable them to compete with the branded schools in the neighbourhood. Concerted
                                    effort was made to introduce and implement a new curriculum design, which emphasised
                                    student and teacher participation in all academic support programmes. Change in
                                    leadership and successful implementation of AQMS led to efficient school governance.
                                    Participation in a range of inter-school competitions increased awareness about
                                    the school and helped in image-building. Special attention to teacher recruitment
                                    and training, demographic profiling of parents and improvement in Board exam results
                                    led to increased admissions. Currently, we are focusing on Board liaison for recognition
                                    of classes XI and XII.

                                    In 2008-09, Pearson Schools took over the management of its first school, an institution
                                    that was literally unknown to the parent community. Ever since we took over the
                                    reins of the school, we have introduced several significant changes. The infrastructure
                                    and the socio-economic profile of the parents seeking admissions have undergone
                                    a substantial improvement resulting in 10 times increase in student strength in
                                    a short span of only 3 years. In addition to a comprehensive curriculum being designed
                                    and implemented, extensive teacher and management training programmes are conducted
                                    to ensure effective governance of the school. In an effort to build an improved
                                    image and gain recognition, uniquely themed and well executed Annual Day and Sports
                                    Day functions are organised every year which draws in parents and children in large
                                    numbers.

                                    Result: The School is now affiliated to CBSE. Post the adjustment of the fee structure
                                    according to the demographic needs, the admissions have increased by 132%.', 
                                ', 
                                    2. DEBT TO PROFIT', 
                                    In 2009-10, Pearson Schools took over the management of an international school
                                    in one of the metros which had a large debt burden, in addition to a negative image
                                    among parents due to poor strength of the school. We began by focussing on extensive
                                    marketing activities to create awareness and curiosity about the school, increase
                                    walk-ins and build the image of the school as one of the best IB schools in the
                                    city. We are continuing our efforts to set right the school documentation and affiliation
                                    details and have appointed Academic Co-ordinator to ensure sustained academic support
                                    and effective leadership. With support from IB and CBSE, we have ensured best practices
                                    from both the streams. Parental involvement', 
                                    has been another main area of focus. Comprehensive teacher training programmes and
                                    workshops are conducted at regular intervals while senior teachers are encouraged
                                    to participate at international workshops.

                                    years, the school has witnessed 19% increase in school collections and 38% increase
                                    in student strength',

                                    In 2009-10, Pearson Schools started a school in one of the tier-1 cities in West
                                    India. Being a start-up school, we created a detailed counselling programme for
                                    quick conversion of queries. Qualified teachers were selected through a rigorous
                                    interview process and were given extensive training on the implementation and monitoring
                                    of the academic programme. We ensured that the focus was on small class strength,
                                    digital learning and coscholastics; a good sports program was guaranteed with a
                                    partnership with EduSports. Parents were heavily involved in the child\u2019s school
                                    life, which resulted in generating good word-of-mouth promotion and increased admissions.', 
                                    has been another main area of focus. Comprehensive teacher training programmes and
                                    workshops are conducted at regular intervals while senior teachers are encouraged

                                    Result: In less than two years, the School has grown to strength of 600+ and emerged
                                    as top school of choice in the city.',

                                    In 2009-10, Pearson Schools took over the management of a large school in a metro
                                    in South India which was looking for a partner to take them to the next level and
                                    enable them to compete with the branded schools in the neighbourhood. Concerted
                                    effort was made to introduce and implement a new curriculum design, which emphasised
                                    student and teacher participation in all academic support programmes. Change in
                                    leadership and successful implementation of AQMS led to efficient school governance.
                                    Participation in a range of inter-school competitions increased awareness about
                                    the school and helped in image-building. Special attention to teacher recruitment
                                    and training, demographic profiling of parents and improvement in Board exam results
                                    led to increased admissions. Currently, we are focusing on Board liaison for recognition
                                    of classes XI and XII.
