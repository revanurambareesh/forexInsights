}', Energy News Monitor | Volume XIII; Issue 20', Coal Ministry reportedly opposed to NITI Aayog\u2019s draft Energy Policy as draft policy threatens to take away CIL\u2019s monopoly on pricing amongst other roundups',  ', Electricity transmitting from one area to another', Source: Pixabay',  ', Energy Monitor',  ', Energy Security',  ', November', Coal News Commentary: September \u2013 October 2016', India', The Coal Ministry was reportedly opposed to NITI Aayog\u2019s draft Energy Policy as the draft policy threatens to take away CIL\u2019s monopoly on pricing. The draft National Energy Policy has recommended aligning domestic coal prices with international rates. While there is some truth in the observation that there is reluctance on the part of CIL to let go of control one must also keep in mind that power tariff is regulated which limits CIL\u2019s ability to set prices.  The power sector consumes most of the coal produced by CIL and so if coal prices are de-regulated, power tariff must also be freed of all formal and informal controls.', Other news that was reported this week betrayed the lack of demand for coal. Not only was coal import declining, off-take of domestic coal too appeared to be below expectations. The onset of winter in the Northern part of the country may increase demand as people begin to turn on their heaters.', Coal beneficiation was also in the news which is a good sign. If the coal sector wants to remain competitive in a challenging environment the focus must shift from quantity to quality. Though India is ranked third in the world in coal production in terms of quantity it slips to fifth place in terms of quality. For every 1 tonne of coal mined in Australia, India has to mine 1.5 tonnes of coal to obtain the same energy content. India cannot afford to sustain this inefficiency.', Increase in domestic tax on coking coal was also reported widely this week. Apart from regular taxes, mining now involves the payment for DMF, payment of NMET, both as a percentage of royalty, and clean energy cess that has been increased to ` 400 per tonne for FY17 in addition to auction commitments. Unless there is some change in tax policy Indian coking coal may lose out to competition from imports.  This is not necessarily in national interest.', Rest of the World ', China reportedly imported 24.26 MT of coal in September, up more than a third from a year ago according to Reuters. The reason behind this is said to be government-enforced mine closures which forced coal users to turn towards imported coal. For the year to date, imports increased 15.2 percent to 180 MT. China\u2019s coal import behaviour has traditionally been based on price arbitrage. In 2009, China, a traditional net exporter of coal, suddenly imported a record breaking 126 MT of coal which accounted for 15 percent of globally traded coal. As per a study, China\u2019s sudden coal import behaviour did not represent a structural shift in the global market but rather a cost-minimisation strategy that would involve both buying and selling coal in the international market to take advantage of the arbitrage opportunities in the price of domestic and globally traded coal.', China\u2019s coal imports also betrayed its geopolitical clout as it imported coal from North Korea ignoring western sanctions. China reportedly imported 2.465 MT of coal from North Korea in August, the highest on record, and 61 percent above what was bought in April, the month sanctions were supposed to take effect.  Coal from North Korea is anthracite, a high grade coal used in steel and other industries.  Mongolia has reportedly recorded a 50.1 percent increase in coal exports to China and Indonesia an increase of 18 percent.', NATIONAL: OIL', Safety concerns loom over LPG scheme for BPL homes', October 25, 2016.',  The Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), which envisages providing liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) connections to families below poverty line (BPL), has run into trouble as distributors have pointed out serious safety loopholes in the scheme and have threatened a long drawn protest. The protest has been triggered by a recent incident in Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh, where an entire Ujjwala beneficiary family perished after an LPG leakage and the distributor has been booked under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections. The oil ministry has said that the government has been acting on the inputs and has taken adequate steps to ensure safety of users. Federation of LPG Distributors of India has pointed out that 90% of the BPL households with LPG connections are unsafe and do not fulfil the basic safety criteria including separate kitchen and living space, pucca house and concrete slabs for cooking. In case of any mishap, the distributor, who is the end link in the chain, can be held liable under IPC provisions, marketing discipline guidelines of oil marketing companies (OMCs) and Essential Commodities Act.', Source: The Economic Times', Four-day old strike by IOC tanker lorries ends', October 25, 2016.',  The four-day old indefinite agitation by a section of tanker lorries, demanding modification of tender conditions and hike in transport charges, ended following talks initiated by the government. The strike by lorries carrying fuel of Indian Oil Corp (IOC) had badly affected movement of petroleum products in Kerala, leading to petrol pumps going dry in some parts of the state. Even supply of aviation fuels from Irumpanam depot in Kochi to three international airports in the state had been hit due to the strike. Transport Minister A K Saseendran said the strike has been called off and further discussions would be held later. Tanker lorries transporting fuel to retail outlets from Kochi and Kozhikode depots of IOC, had demanded a hike in fare from ` 2.02 per km to ` 3.50 per km, which was not agreeable to IOC, as it would result in escalation of fuel costs. The strike began, following which the lorries did not collect fuel from Irumpanam in kochi and Kozhikode plants.', Source: Business Standard', Cabinet may take a call on Cairn India\u2019s Barmer extension', October 24, 2016.',  A decision on the 10-year-extension for production sharing contract (PSC) of Barmer oil and gas block of Cairn India and Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) in Rajasthan beyond 2020 is likely to be taken by the Cabinet. The government is likely to take up a group of 28 pre-new exploration licensing policy (NELP) exploratory blocks for clearance soon, including the Barmer block. The block, which is also known as Rajasthan block, includes the Mangala, Bhagyam, Aishwariya and Raageshwari oil and gas fields. It is the biggest onshore oil producing project in India and produces about 166,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, accounting for about 27 percent of the country\u2019s overall oil production. In March this year, the Cabinet had cleared the extension of 28 small- and medium-sized discovered fields.', Source: Business Standard', RIL to seal ethane ship deal', October 24, 2016.',  Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) is set to buy six very large ethane carriers (VLEC) from South Korea\u2019s Samsung Heavy Industries Co Ltd for $600 million. The deal is to be signed in Mongolia\u2019s capital Ulan Bator. These bespoke carriers -the largest such ships to be built -will carry liquefied ethane, a key feedstock for petrochemicals, from the US to RIL\u2019s refinery in Jamnagar off the coast of Gujarat. A very large ethane carrier is a hybrid of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) carrier and a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) carrier. RIL had entered into a strategic association with Japanese shipping powerhouse Mitsui OSK Lines for the ethane carriers in December 2014. Mitsui is supervising construction and will operate and manage the fleet for RIL with deliveries commencing in December.', Source: The Economic Times', Oil Minister launches Ujjwala LPG scheme in Amethi', October 24, 2016.',  Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan attacked Amethi MP Rahul Gandhi for turning down the government\u2019s formal invite to attend the inauguration of the Rajiv Gandhi Petroleum Technology Institute (RGPTI). Launching the NDA government\u2019s ambitious Ujjawala liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) scheme, the minister gave away 1,000 free gas connections to Amethi\u2019s poor.', Source: The Economic Times', RIL forays into LPG retailing', October 23, 2016.',  Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), operator of the world\u2019s biggest oil-refining complex, has forayed into cooking gas retailing, launching a 4-kg liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinder on pilot basis. LPG consumption is growing by over 10 percent and private refiners RIL and Essar Oil want a pie of it. Currently, public sector retailers Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum control retail LPG market, selling cooking gas in 5-kg, 14.2-kg and 19-kg cylinders. They sell 12 cylinders of 14.2-kg or 34 bottles of 5-kg per year to households on subsidised rates and any requirement above that on market price. The 19-kg cylinder is for commercial use.', Source: The Economic Times', Oil Minister asks states to help bring petro products under GST', October 23, 2016.',  Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan nudged the states to agree on bringing all petroleum products under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime. He said petroleum is currently under \u2018state list\u2019 for the purpose of taxation under GST. As per the GST Constitutional Amendment Bill, petroleum products like LPG, kerosene and naptha would attract GST. However, other products \u2014 crude oil, natural gas, petrol, diesel, high speed diesel and aviation turbine fuel \u2014 have been excluded from GST for initial years. Hence, these products will continue to be taxed in the hands of the states as they are being taxed at present. The GST Council will decide on the date of inclusion of these products in the GST basket and rates thereon. Pradhan asked Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan to support bringing all petroleum products under the GST regime. With two different kinds of taxation structure, in the new regime the oil and gas industry would have to comply with both the current tax regime as well as GST.', Source: The Times of India', Cooking gas scarcity hits Mizoram', October 20, 2016.',  People in Mizoram are facing a harrowing time due to acute scarcity of cooking gas. Things have come to such a pass that people are willing to pay up to Rs 3,000 for one cylinder in the black market but to no avail. Residents of Aizawl said a cylinder, which used to last for a month earlier, now don\u2019t even last for even 15 days. A number of families in Aizawl and other towns are using firewood and stoves for cooking. The scarcity of cooking gas, which is going on since July, started after a non-tribal contractor refused to transport LPG cylinders to Mizoram in the wake of Young Mizo Association (YMA) volunteers launching a crackdown on drivers and their accomplices for tampering with LPG cylinders. The YMA volunteers have seized over 600 cylinders which were tampered with on NH-54. State food, civil supplies and consumer affairs department said the contractor\u2019s bid for Indian Oil Corp\u2019s (IOC) tender was too low and unworkable which prompted the drivers, who were underpaid, to resort to tampering with cooking gas cylinders to get extra money. Officials at the Mualkhang gas bottling plant in Kolasib district said they are no trucks to transport gas cylinders. Minister for food, civil supplies and consumer affairs John Rotluangliana, said the scarcity will soon be over as the IOC has allowed coking gas distributors to hire trucks for transporting cylinders.', Source: The Times of India', RIL gross refining margins to moderate in September quarter', October 19, 2016.',  Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) is expected to see its gross refining margins (GRM) decline in the September quarter after repeating a seven-year high in the June quarter, even as analysts expect its petrochemical margins to remain healthy and offset the fall in GRMs. In a poll, five analysts estimated a consolidated net profit of ` 7,268 crore and revenue of ` 62,920 crore. In the September 2015 quarter, the company reported a consolidated net profit of ` 6,720 crore and turnover of ` 75,117 crore. RIL will announce its financial results for the July-September 2016 quarter on October 20.', Source: Business Standard', NATIONAL: GAS', Govt wins $1 bn price dispute with RIL, BG', October 25, 2016.',  The Centre has won an international arbitration involving potential claim of more than $1 billion, initiated six years ago by Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) and the Indian arm of BG (formerly British Gas) following a gas price and royalty dispute in the PannaMukta and Tapti fields off the Mumbai coast. The London-based arbitration panel rejected RIL-BG\u2019s main demands for higher cost recovery limit and certain deductions while calculating wellhead price of gas, all of which have a direct impact on their revenue. The arbitration tribunal has by majority issued a final partial award (FPA), and separately, two dissenting opinions in the matter. RIL is in the process of reviewing the FPA and the dissenting opinions in detail and shall be taking the appropriate next steps based on legal advice. The tribunal has scheduled a procedural hearing on December 18-19 where the procedural timetable of the arbitration going forward is likely to be decided.', Source: The Times of India', Adani Petronet gets green nod for Rs',  4.6 bn Dahej port expansion', October 24, 2016.',  Adani Petronet has received green clearance for the third phase expansion of its Dahej port in Bharuch district of Gujarat that will entail an investment of about Rs 464.32 crore. Adani Petronet (Dahej) Port Pvt Ltd (APPPL), a joint venture of Adani Enterprise and Petronet LNG, has developed the Dahej port in a phased manner. The third phase expansion will entail raising cargo-handling capacity to 23 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) from 11.7 mtpa and development of other supporting infrastructure.', Source: The Economic Times', KINFRA sets-up petrochemical park in Kochi', October 22, 2016.',  The Kerala government has accorded an in-principal approval to the Kerala Industrial Infrastructure Development Corp (KINFRA) to set up a petrochemical park in Kochi. The project cost estimated to be ` 1,864 crore, including land cost and cost of internal infrastructure. KINFRA intends to set up the park in 600 acre of land to be procured from FACT at Ambalamugal, Kochi, the company said. The proposal assumes significance in view of the expansion proposal of Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL), proximity to the port and natural gas infrastructure at the location, KINFRA said.', Source: The Hindu Business Line', CCI to probe GAIL for unfair business ways', October 19, 2016.',  The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has ordered an investigation against GAIL (India) Ltd for indulging in alleged unfair business practices with regard to supply and distribution of gas to industrial players. CCI considered \u2018supply and distribution of natural gas to industrial consumers\u2019 as the relevant market. For three complaints, Gurgaon district was taken as the relevant one while it is Rewari district for the remaining two cases. Terming GAIL\u2019s activities as \u201cunexpected business behaviour\u201d, CCI said the company did not come forward for amicable settlement for the dispute as provided in the Gas Supply Agreement (GSA).', Source: Business Standard', NATIONAL: COAL', JSW Energy inks MoU to set up power plant in Swaziland', October 25, 2016.',  JSW Energy said it has signed a binding Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Swaziland Electricity Company (SEC) and the Swaziland government to set up a thermal power plant in the Kingdom of Swaziland. The capacity of the power plant to be set up will be decided by JSW Energy in consultation with SEC based on the coal resources found during the exploration of an area of approximately 16,000 hectares to be prospected by JSW Energy under a prospecting licence granted to them. In addition to meeting the total power demand of Swaziland which currently stands at around 300 MW, JSW Energy and SEC shall also explore the possibility of exporting power to the neighbouring countries that are connected through a common transmission network, it said. The MoU provides for setting up a thermal power plant and undertaking of mining activities pursuant to execution of definitive agreements \u2013 a long term Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) to be guaranteed by the Kingdom of Swaziland and fuel supply agreement from captive coal resources, among others.', Source: The Economic Times', CIL to start spot e-auction', October 19, 2016.',  Coal India Ltd (CIL) will begin a special spot e-auction of coal and will put on offer 20 million tonnes (MT) of the fossil fuel for various sectors, including power, amid the government\u2019s efforts towards 24×7 power for all. The auction will be conducted for four days beginning on October 20. The total validity for lifting of coal under the special spot auction window will be up to March 2017. The reserve price will be limited to the upper cap of 20 per cent add-on over the notified price of coal for the non-power sector. The rake size shall be as per prevalent railway rules. The quantity of coal in a rake will be as indicated in the notice of e-auction of coal companies. CIL had announced a one-time offer of 20 MT of coal under a special spot e-auction in the ongoing fiscal year. The coal ministry had earlier said power producers being supplied coal through the MoU (Memorandum of Understanding) route by CIL will have to take it via special e-auction being conducted for the power sector. CIL, a major supplier of coal to the power sector, is eyeing production of one billion tonne by 2020.', Source: NDTV', National: Power', Maharashtra state power utility launches amnesty plan', October 25, 2016.',  The state power utility has appealed defaulter consumers whose electricity supply has been disconnected permanently due to non-payment of dues, to take benefit of fresh amnesty scheme starting from November 1. Aurangabad circle of Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd (MSEDCL) has jurisdiction over Aurangabad and Jalna districts where dues worth whooping ` 258.25 crore are pending towards 2,15,715 defaulter consumers. The consumers whose power supply has been disconnected permanently before March 2016 are eligible for the scheme named as Abhay Yojna. The defaulter consumers paying bill during the amnesty scheme till November 30 will have to just pay their outstanding dues with 5% discount as the interest charges, penalty and late payment charges would be waived off, power utility has said. While the amnesty scheme is going to run till April next year, the defaulter consumes paying their pending bills after November 30 will be given only 75% waiver in interest charges. The consumers paying their outstanding dues during amnesty scheme can immediately claim for resumption of power, MSEDCL has said. The amnesty scheme will not be applicable for agricultural pumps and public water supply schemes. As per official record, Aurangabad urban area has 29,902 consumers whose power supply has been snapped permanently, while rural parts of the district has total 81,334 such defaulters. In Jalna district, power supply of total 1,04,479 consumers have been disconnected over non-payment of dues.

The MSEDCL has appealed for contacting designated helpline numbers 1912, 18002003435, 18002333435 in case any difficulties.', Source: The Economic Times', Role of technology in improving power generation efficiency in India', October 25, 2016.',  India, like any other developing country, cannot overlook the pivotal role of the power sector in fuelling its overall development. All other sectors require a constant and reliable supply of electricity for the economy to function and grow. What sets the country apart though is the fact that it is the fifth largest producer and consumer of electricity with a capacity of 302 GW. From a meagre 1,743 MWh in 1950-51, the gross electricity generation boomed to 278,733 MWh in 2015, yet India is not a power surplus country even in the present coverage where around 1/4', th',  of its total population is still deprived of access to electricity. The distribution of power generation through different sources, however, is uneven. The thermal power contribution to this is around 63%, followed by hydropower contributing around 25%. The share of nuclear power is the smallest with 3%, and the power generation through renewable sources contributes the remaining 9%. The distribution of power generation amongst various states and regions in India is also highly uneven.', Source: The Economic Times', SBI-led consortium seek investor for 600 MW power project', October 25, 2016.',  A lenders\u2019 consortium led by SBI is looking for a strategic investor for an under-construction 600 MW power plant at Raigarh in Chattisgarh. The consortium comprising SBI, State bank of Bikaner & Jaipur, L&T Infrastructure Finance and PTC Financial Services has proposed to conduct a Swiss Challenge auction for the under construction 600 MW (2×300 MW) thermal power project located in Raigarh, Chattisgarh, according to the bid document. IDBI Capital has been appointed as advisor for the transaction. The consortium has already received an offer from an interested party. As per the bid document, a company is in the process of constructing a coal-fired thermal power plant of 1200 MW capacity Independent Power Plant in Raigarh District of Chhattisgarh in two phases of 600 MW each; of which Phase-I 600 MW is currently under implementation along with entire required infrastructure for 1200 MW project. The original cost of the project was appraised at ` 3,787.20 crore by the lenders in the debt-equity ratio of 75:25. But due to delay it has over-run to ` 5,673.2 crore. Commissioning dates were revised to March 2016 and June 2016 for Unit 1 and 2 respectively in July 2015 and were accepted by the lenders also. However, the company has again submitted their request for extension for commissioning date till December 2016 to the lenders.', Source: The Economic Times', Tata Power CEO says to buy stranded power assets in India', October 25, 2016.',  Tata Power Company Ltd plans to expand capacity by acquiring some of the country\u2019s numerous underutilized plants instead of investing in expensive new facilities, the utility\u2019s chief executive officer (CEO) Anil Sardana said. Tata in June bought 25 percent of Singapore-based Resurgent Power Ventures Ptd Ltd which is tasked with seeking such assets in India, he said. Domestic acquisitions are part of Tata\u2019s plan to nearly double its global power capacity to 20,000 MW by 2025. Of that, 30 percent to 40 percent will come from unconventional sources including hydropower rather than coal, he said.

The projects are feasible even with oil at $40 a barrel, the National Iranian Oil Co. (NIOC) said. The South Azadegan field on Iran\u2019s southwestern border will be the first deal announced, and probably needs $10 billion to add 600,000 barrels a day of output, NIOC said.', Source: Bloomberg', International: GAS', Russia says ready to subsidize gas supplies to Belarus', October 25, 2016.',  Russia will subsidize natural gas supplies to Belarus after Minsk settles an outstanding debt for past supplies, Russia\u2019s Deputy Finance Minister Sergei Storchak said. The two countries have been at odds since the start of the year over how much Belarus should pay Gazprom for its gas after a slump in global energy prices. Belarus said that it was poised to give Russia $280 million to cover shortfalls. Gazprom has previously charged Belarus $132 per 1,000 cubic meters of gas.', Source: Reuters', US O&G producers stir from hibernation', October 24, 2016.',  United States (US) oil and gas (O&G) drillers are reporting the biggest and most sustained upturn since oil prices began slumping in the middle of 2014. The number of rigs drilling across the country has risen by 149, or 40 percent, since hitting a cyclical low at the end of May, according to oilfield services company Baker Hughes. The active rig count has risen in 18 of the last 21 weeks confirming that a sustained upturn in drilling is occurring. Most of the extra rigs are targeting oil-rich formations (127) rather than gas-bearing formations (21) though most wells will produce a mix of hydrocarbons.', Source: Reuters', Macquarie closes its London O&G investment desk', October 21, 2016.',  Australia\u2019s top investment bank Macquarie Group has closed its London-based upstream oil and gas (O&G) advisory after a sharp drop in global deal making in recent years. The business, which oversaw the oil and gas production sector in Europe, Middle East and Africa, and which consisted of eight employees, was closed. Three members of the upstream team will move to the Macquarie Capital\u2019s midstream oil and gas investment service under Ed Winter, which focuses on energy infrastructure such as pipelines and storage. Macquarie continues to have exposure to the oil sector through its commodities and financial markets team that runs hedging programs and reserves based loans for companies.', Source: Reuters', Indonesia considers Inpex request to boost Masela LNG output again', October 21, 2016.',  Indonesia expects to decide within \u201cone or two weeks\u201d on a plan by Inpex Corp to increase proposed output from the Masela natural gas field to nearly four times the level originally slated. President Joko Widodo in March rejected a $15 billion plan by Inpex and Shell to develop the world\u2019s largest floating liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility to process gas from Masela, saying an onshore plant would benefit the local economy more. The move was a blow to both companies and pushed the anticipated start of production from the field into the late 2020s. Indonesia gets priority on a large portion of domestically produced LNG, but development of infrastructure to absorb the fuel has been slower than hoped both locally and abroad, putting pressure on gas prices. Inpex is also working with BP, Mitsubishi Corp, China Natinoal Offshore Oil Co and other companies on an $8 billion expansion of the Tangguh project in West Papua province that will boost the project\u2019s annual LNG production capacity by 50 percent. Questions remain on how quickly Indonesia can develop infrastructure to absorb gas from these projects, with at least 60 uncommitted cargoes this year and next.', Source: Reuters', PetroChina said to mull raising gas prices as NDRC urges supply', October 20, 2016.',  PetroChina Co. is considering raising non-residential natural gas prices, while China\u2019s top economic planner has urged major suppliers to raise output, as the country seeks to avoid shortages during the peak winter season. The country\u2019s biggest gas producer and distributor plans to boost prices for industrial and commercial users from as soon as November 20, the earliest possible date it\u2019s allowed to under regulations issued by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC). PetroChina plans to raise prices by between 10 percent and 20 percent. The NDRC called on China\u2019s major natural gas producers, including China National Petroleum Corp, China Petrochemical Corp and China National Offshore Oil Corp, to increase output to alleviate tight supplies in the north and northwest regions.  PetroChina\u2019s planned price increase is partially designed to alleviate gas shortages in the northern provinces, where PetroChina expects to see tight supplies because of high winter-heating demand. China\u2019s natural-gas imports surged to a record last month. China imported 5.73 million metric tons of the fuel in September, the General Administration of Customs said.', Source: Bloomberg', Shell selling 16 upstream assets worth more than $500 mn', October 19, 2016.',  Royal Dutch Shell is currently offering 16 assets worth more than $500 million for sale as part of its vast $30 billion three-year asset sales program, the oil and gas company\u2019s head of upstream Andy Brown said.

', The National Energy Administration (NEA) of China has announced new restrictions on the construction of coal-fired power plants, postponing the construction of some projects that have already secured approval, or simply cancelling them. The agency will also stop projects having started construction in 2016 and will reassess the schedule for those whose construction started in 2015.', Source: Enerdata', CEZ sells 296 MW Tisova coal-fired plant in the Czech Republic', October 24, 2016. ', Czech energy group CEZ has reached an agreement with coal mining group Sokolovska uhelna, putting an end to their long commercial disputes and paving the way for further cooperation in future generation of power and heat from the brown coal extracted in the Sokolov region (Czech Republic). Under the terms of the agreement, CEZ will sell its 296 MW Tisova coal-fired power plant to Sokolovska uhelna, which consists of two units commissioned in 1958 and 1960, respectively.', Source: Enerdata', China\u2019s utilities beg for coal as supply expansions yet to kick in', October 21, 2016.',  China\u2019s electric power utilities are scrambling to get coal from anywhere they can, but are coming up short as efforts to boost supply take time to come into effect. China\u2019s government in September ordered miners to boost thermal coal output by 1 million tonnes per day, but it will take months before new supplies from the recent reopening of mines hits the market. Additionally, new rules on trucking have caused logjams in deliveries and transportation price spikes while suppliers at home and abroad are digging in for ever-higher prices. Beijing\u2019s steps to boost coal supplies have done little to derail the months-long price rally. South China coal futures prices hit record highs this week above $85 per tonne, up by 21 percent since the start of the month.', Source: Reuters', US coal industry hopes for respite after perfect storm', October 20, 2016.',  US coal producers have been struck by a range of structural and cyclical factors that hit consumption hard and forced many of them to seek bankruptcy protection during 2015 and 2016.

It will overtake France to have the second-highest number of nuclear reactors by 2020, Agneta Rising, the WNA said. In Asia, 134 operable reactors generated 400 terawatt-hours of electricity in 2015, making up 16 percent of global nuclear generation, the WNA said. Another 39 reactors comprising 47.4 GW are currently under construction in Asia, which comprises nearly two-thirds of global reactor construction. China makes up the bulk with 20 reactors under construction. New reactor construction is mostly led by industrializing countries which have enjoyed high levels of economic growth with an accompanying increase in energy demand, the WNA said. Four countries are expected to account for 70 percent of reactors commissioned in the period to 2030, which are China, Russia, India and South Korea.', Source: Reuters', Humanity enters \u2018new era of climate change\u2019 as CO', 2',  levels break all records: WMO', October 25, 2016.',  The world has now entered a new climate reality era, with average concentration of carbon dioxide (CO', 2) ', expected to remain above the threshold level of 400 parts per million throughout 2016, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). According to the Guardian, WMO bulletin reveals that in 2015, for the first time, CO', 2 ', levels in the atmosphere were at 400 parts per million (ppm) on average across the year as a whole. World\u2019s longest established greenhouse gas monitoring station at Mauna Loa in Hawaii estimates CO', 2 ', concentrations in atmosphere will stay above the symbolic 400ppm for the whole of 2016 and reach new highs. It will not dip below the 400ppm mark again for many generations, the experts said.', Source: Zee News', Masdar to build 200 MW solar project in Jordan', October 24, 2016.',  Abu Dhabi\u2019s renewable energy company Masdar has signed an agreement to supply power from the proposed 200 MW photovoltaic (PV) solar plant in Jordan to National Electric Power Company (NEPCO). The new solar plant, which will be linked to Al Muwaqqar substation located approximately 10 km outside Amman, is expected to generate electricity required to power around 110,000 homes annually. The project is also expected to reduce about 360,000 tons of CO', 2',  emissions annually. In December 2015, Jordan Wind Project Company has commissioned the 117 MW Tafila wind farm in the country.

Signs that governments are growing increasingly serious about tackling climate change suggest that businesses need to be ready for greater regulation, Fisher said. A paper presented to the Hangzhou G-20 meeting by the UK\u2019s Cambridge Centre for Sustainable Finance urged financial institutions to improve the way they assess climate risks. Fisher said there\u2019s a possibility of unexpected moves in financial markets as a result of climate change.', Source: Bloomberg', Omaha Public Power District Fort Calhoun nuclear power plant shut', October 24, 2016.',  Omaha Public Power District\u2019s 479 MW Fort Calhoun nuclear power plant in Nebraska was closed after 43 years of service. The public electric utility said that personnel would power down the plant for the last time and begin the defueling process. In May, the utility said that continued operation of the aging reactor was not in the company\u2019s long-term financial interests due in part to weak power prices related to low cost renewable and natural gas-fired generation resources.', Source: Reuters', France suspends carbon floor price planned on 1 January 2017', October 24, 2016. ', The French government has decided not to introduce a carbon price floor of around \u20ac30 per tonne as of 1 January 2017. That carbon price floor was proposed in the 2017 finance bill, that was due to be adopted by the Parliament in November 2016. It would have applied on the basis of CO', 2',  emissions, but operators of gas-fired power plants such as Engie claimed that the measure would raise production costs and make French plants less competitive compared with foreign plants. In the summer 2016, the carbon price floor proposal was thus restricted to coal-fired power plants, which account for less than 2% of power generation. The United Kingdom has already introduced a domestic carbon floor price of around \u20ac258 per tonne, while Germany and several other European countries are considering a floor price for carbon emissions, an option that is increasingly supported by investment funds and companies. Since 2008, carbon prices under the European Emissions Trading System have fallen from around \u20ac30 per tonne to \u20ac6 per tonne due to a glut in emission permits.', Source: Enerdata', Exxon heads for courtroom faceoff with New York in climate probe', October 21, 2016.',  Exxon Mobil Corp is headed to a courtroom in New York for the first time to try to block the state\u2019s demand for accounting documents about how climate change will affect its finances. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, probing whether the company and its accountants tried to hide the risk from investors and the public, sued Exxon and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) in a bid to force them to comply with a subpoena issued in August.

}', Energy News Monitor | Volume XIII; Issue 20', Coal Ministry reportedly opposed to NITI Aayog\u2019s draft Energy Policy as draft policy threatens to take away CIL\u2019s monopoly on pricing amongst other roundups',  ', Electricity transmitting from one area to another', Source: Pixabay',  ', Energy Monitor',  ', Energy Security',  ', November', Coal News Commentary: September \u2013 October 2016', India', The Coal Ministry was reportedly opposed to NITI Aayog\u2019s draft Energy Policy as the draft policy threatens to take away CIL\u2019s monopoly on pricing. The draft National Energy Policy has recommended aligning domestic coal prices with international rates. While there is some truth in the observation that there is reluctance on the part of CIL to let go of control one must also keep in mind that power tariff is regulated which limits CIL\u2019s ability to set prices.  The power sector consumes most of the coal produced by CIL and so if coal prices are de-regulated, power tariff must also be freed of all formal and informal controls.', Other news that was reported this week betrayed the lack of demand for coal. Not only was coal import declining, off-take of domestic coal too appeared to be below expectations. The onset of winter in the Northern part of the country may increase demand as people begin to turn on their heaters.', Coal beneficiation was also in the news which is a good sign. If the coal sector wants to remain competitive in a challenging environment the focus must shift from quantity to quality. Though India is ranked third in the world in coal production in terms of quantity it slips to fifth place in terms of quality. For every 1 tonne of coal mined in Australia, India has to mine 1.5 tonnes of coal to obtain the same energy content. India cannot afford to sustain this inefficiency.', Increase in domestic tax on coking coal was also reported widely this week. Apart from regular taxes, mining now involves the payment for DMF, payment of NMET, both as a percentage of royalty, and clean energy cess that has been increased to ` 400 per tonne for FY17 in addition to auction commitments. Unless there is some change in tax policy Indian coking coal may lose out to competition from imports.  This is not necessarily in national interest.', Rest of the World ', China reportedly imported 24.26 MT of coal in September, up more than a third from a year ago according to Reuters. The reason behind this is said to be government-enforced mine closures which forced coal users to turn towards imported coal. For the year to date, imports increased 15.2 percent to 180 MT. China\u2019s coal import behaviour has traditionally been based on price arbitrage. In 2009, China, a traditional net exporter of coal, suddenly imported a record breaking 126 MT of coal which accounted for 15 percent of globally traded coal. As per a study, China\u2019s sudden coal import behaviour did not represent a structural shift in the global market but rather a cost-minimisation strategy that would involve both buying and selling coal in the international market to take advantage of the arbitrage opportunities in the price of domestic and globally traded coal.', China\u2019s coal imports also betrayed its geopolitical clout as it imported coal from North Korea ignoring western sanctions. China reportedly imported 2.465 MT of coal from North Korea in August, the highest on record, and 61 percent above what was bought in April, the month sanctions were supposed to take effect.  Coal from North Korea is anthracite, a high grade coal used in steel and other industries.  Mongolia has reportedly recorded a 50.1 percent increase in coal exports to China and Indonesia an increase of 18 percent.', NATIONAL: OIL', Safety concerns loom over LPG scheme for BPL homes', October 25, 2016.',  The Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), which envisages providing liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) connections to families below poverty line (BPL), has run into trouble as distributors have pointed out serious safety loopholes in the scheme and have threatened a long drawn protest. The protest has been triggered by a recent incident in Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh, where an entire Ujjwala beneficiary family perished after an LPG leakage and the distributor has been booked under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections. The oil ministry has said that the government has been acting on the inputs and has taken adequate steps to ensure safety of users. Federation of LPG Distributors of India has pointed out that 90% of the BPL households with LPG connections are unsafe and do not fulfil the basic safety criteria including separate kitchen and living space, pucca house and concrete slabs for cooking. In case of any mishap, the distributor, who is the end link in the chain, can be held liable under IPC provisions, marketing discipline guidelines of oil marketing companies (OMCs) and Essential Commodities Act.', Source: The Economic Times', Four-day old strike by IOC tanker lorries ends', October 25, 2016.',  The four-day old indefinite agitation by a section of tanker lorries, demanding modification of tender conditions and hike in transport charges, ended following talks initiated by the government. The strike by lorries carrying fuel of Indian Oil Corp (IOC) had badly affected movement of petroleum products in Kerala, leading to petrol pumps going dry in some parts of the state. Even supply of aviation fuels from Irumpanam depot in Kochi to three international airports in the state had been hit due to the strike. Transport Minister A K Saseendran said the strike has been called off and further discussions would be held later. Tanker lorries transporting fuel to retail outlets from Kochi and Kozhikode depots of IOC, had demanded a hike in fare from ` 2.02 per km to ` 3.50 per km, which was not agreeable to IOC, as it would result in escalation of fuel costs. The strike began, following which the lorries did not collect fuel from Irumpanam in kochi and Kozhikode plants.', Source: Business Standard', Cabinet may take a call on Cairn India\u2019s Barmer extension', October 24, 2016.',  A decision on the 10-year-extension for production sharing contract (PSC) of Barmer oil and gas block of Cairn India and Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) in Rajasthan beyond 2020 is likely to be taken by the Cabinet. The government is likely to take up a group of 28 pre-new exploration licensing policy (NELP) exploratory blocks for clearance soon, including the Barmer block. The block, which is also known as Rajasthan block, includes the Mangala, Bhagyam, Aishwariya and Raageshwari oil and gas fields. It is the biggest onshore oil producing project in India and produces about 166,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, accounting for about 27 percent of the country\u2019s overall oil production. In March this year, the Cabinet had cleared the extension of 28 small- and medium-sized discovered fields.', Source: Business Standard', RIL to seal ethane ship deal', October 24, 2016.',  Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) is set to buy six very large ethane carriers (VLEC) from South Korea\u2019s Samsung Heavy Industries Co Ltd for $600 million. The deal is to be signed in Mongolia\u2019s capital Ulan Bator. These bespoke carriers -the largest such ships to be built -will carry liquefied ethane, a key feedstock for petrochemicals, from the US to RIL\u2019s refinery in Jamnagar off the coast of Gujarat. A very large ethane carrier is a hybrid of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) carrier and a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) carrier. RIL had entered into a strategic association with Japanese shipping powerhouse Mitsui OSK Lines for the ethane carriers in December 2014. Mitsui is supervising construction and will operate and manage the fleet for RIL with deliveries commencing in December.', Source: The Economic Times', Oil Minister launches Ujjwala LPG scheme in Amethi', October 24, 2016.',  Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan attacked Amethi MP Rahul Gandhi for turning down the government\u2019s formal invite to attend the inauguration of the Rajiv Gandhi Petroleum Technology Institute (RGPTI). Launching the NDA government\u2019s ambitious Ujjawala liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) scheme, the minister gave away 1,000 free gas connections to Amethi\u2019s poor.', Source: The Economic Times', RIL forays into LPG retailing', October 23, 2016.',  Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), operator of the world\u2019s biggest oil-refining complex, has forayed into cooking gas retailing, launching a 4-kg liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinder on pilot basis. LPG consumption is growing by over 10 percent and private refiners RIL and Essar Oil want a pie of it. Currently, public sector retailers Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum control retail LPG market, selling cooking gas in 5-kg, 14.2-kg and 19-kg cylinders. They sell 12 cylinders of 14.2-kg or 34 bottles of 5-kg per year to households on subsidised rates and any requirement above that on market price. The 19-kg cylinder is for commercial use.', Source: The Economic Times', Oil Minister asks states to help bring petro products under GST', October 23, 2016.',  Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan nudged the states to agree on bringing all petroleum products under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime. He said petroleum is currently under \u2018state list\u2019 for the purpose of taxation under GST. As per the GST Constitutional Amendment Bill, petroleum products like LPG, kerosene and naptha would attract GST. However, other products \u2014 crude oil, natural gas, petrol, diesel, high speed diesel and aviation turbine fuel \u2014 have been excluded from GST for initial years. Hence, these products will continue to be taxed in the hands of the states as they are being taxed at present. The GST Council will decide on the date of inclusion of these products in the GST basket and rates thereon. Pradhan asked Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan to support bringing all petroleum products under the GST regime. With two different kinds of taxation structure, in the new regime the oil and gas industry would have to comply with both the current tax regime as well as GST.', Source: The Times of India', Cooking gas scarcity hits Mizoram', October 20, 2016.',  People in Mizoram are facing a harrowing time due to acute scarcity of cooking gas. Things have come to such a pass that people are willing to pay up to Rs 3,000 for one cylinder in the black market but to no avail. Residents of Aizawl said a cylinder, which used to last for a month earlier, now don\u2019t even last for even 15 days. A number of families in Aizawl and other towns are using firewood and stoves for cooking. The scarcity of cooking gas, which is going on since July, started after a non-tribal contractor refused to transport LPG cylinders to Mizoram in the wake of Young Mizo Association (YMA) volunteers launching a crackdown on drivers and their accomplices for tampering with LPG cylinders. The YMA volunteers have seized over 600 cylinders which were tampered with on NH-54. State food, civil supplies and consumer affairs department said the contractor\u2019s bid for Indian Oil Corp\u2019s (IOC) tender was too low and unworkable which prompted the drivers, who were underpaid, to resort to tampering with cooking gas cylinders to get extra money. Officials at the Mualkhang gas bottling plant in Kolasib district said they are no trucks to transport gas cylinders. Minister for food, civil supplies and consumer affairs John Rotluangliana, said the scarcity will soon be over as the IOC has allowed coking gas distributors to hire trucks for transporting cylinders.', Source: The Times of India', RIL gross refining margins to moderate in September quarter', October 19, 2016.',  Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) is expected to see its gross refining margins (GRM) decline in the September quarter after repeating a seven-year high in the June quarter, even as analysts expect its petrochemical margins to remain healthy and offset the fall in GRMs. In a poll, five analysts estimated a consolidated net profit of ` 7,268 crore and revenue of ` 62,920 crore. In the September 2015 quarter, the company reported a consolidated net profit of ` 6,720 crore and turnover of ` 75,117 crore. RIL will announce its financial results for the July-September 2016 quarter on October 20.', Source: Business Standard', NATIONAL: GAS', Govt wins $1 bn price dispute with RIL, BG', October 25, 2016.',  The Centre has won an international arbitration involving potential claim of more than $1 billion, initiated six years ago by Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) and the Indian arm of BG (formerly British Gas) following a gas price and royalty dispute in the PannaMukta and Tapti fields off the Mumbai coast. The London-based arbitration panel rejected RIL-BG\u2019s main demands for higher cost recovery limit and certain deductions while calculating wellhead price of gas, all of which have a direct impact on their revenue. The arbitration tribunal has by majority issued a final partial award (FPA), and separately, two dissenting opinions in the matter. RIL is in the process of reviewing the FPA and the dissenting opinions in detail and shall be taking the appropriate next steps based on legal advice. The tribunal has scheduled a procedural hearing on December 18-19 where the procedural timetable of the arbitration going forward is likely to be decided.', Source: The Times of India', Adani Petronet gets green nod for Rs',  4.6 bn Dahej port expansion', October 24, 2016.',  Adani Petronet has received green clearance for the third phase expansion of its Dahej port in Bharuch district of Gujarat that will entail an investment of about Rs 464.32 crore. Adani Petronet (Dahej) Port Pvt Ltd (APPPL), a joint venture of Adani Enterprise and Petronet LNG, has developed the Dahej port in a phased manner. The third phase expansion will entail raising cargo-handling capacity to 23 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) from 11.7 mtpa and development of other supporting infrastructure.', Source: The Economic Times', KINFRA sets-up petrochemical park in Kochi', October 22, 2016.',  The Kerala government has accorded an in-principal approval to the Kerala Industrial Infrastructure Development Corp (KINFRA) to set up a petrochemical park in Kochi. The project cost estimated to be ` 1,864 crore, including land cost and cost of internal infrastructure. KINFRA intends to set up the park in 600 acre of land to be procured from FACT at Ambalamugal, Kochi, the company said. The proposal assumes significance in view of the expansion proposal of Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL), proximity to the port and natural gas infrastructure at the location, KINFRA said.', Source: The Hindu Business Line', CCI to probe GAIL for unfair business ways', October 19, 2016.',  The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has ordered an investigation against GAIL (India) Ltd for indulging in alleged unfair business practices with regard to supply and distribution of gas to industrial players.

The capacity of the power plant to be set up will be decided by JSW Energy in consultation with SEC based on the coal resources found during the exploration of an area of approximately 16,000 hectares to be prospected by JSW Energy under a prospecting licence granted to them. In addition to meeting the total power demand of Swaziland which currently stands at around 300 MW, JSW Energy and SEC shall also explore the possibility of exporting power to the neighbouring countries that are connected through a common transmission network, it said. The MoU provides for setting up a thermal power plant and undertaking of mining activities pursuant to execution of definitive agreements \u2013 a long term Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) to be guaranteed by the Kingdom of Swaziland and fuel supply agreement from captive coal resources, among others.', Source: The Economic Times', CIL to start spot e-auction', October 19, 2016.',  Coal India Ltd (CIL) will begin a special spot e-auction of coal and will put on offer 20 million tonnes (MT) of the fossil fuel for various sectors, including power, amid the government\u2019s efforts towards 24×7 power for all. The auction will be conducted for four days beginning on October 20. The total validity for lifting of coal under the special spot auction window will be up to March 2017. The reserve price will be limited to the upper cap of 20 per cent add-on over the notified price of coal for the non-power sector. The rake size shall be as per prevalent railway rules. The quantity of coal in a rake will be as indicated in the notice of e-auction of coal companies. CIL had announced a one-time offer of 20 MT of coal under a special spot e-auction in the ongoing fiscal year. The coal ministry had earlier said power producers being supplied coal through the MoU (Memorandum of Understanding) route by CIL will have to take it via special e-auction being conducted for the power sector.

All other sectors require a constant and reliable supply of electricity for the economy to function and grow. What sets the country apart though is the fact that it is the fifth largest producer and consumer of electricity with a capacity of 302 GW. From a meagre 1,743 MWh in 1950-51, the gross electricity generation boomed to 278,733 MWh in 2015, yet India is not a power surplus country even in the present coverage where around 1/4', th',  of its total population is still deprived of access to electricity. The distribution of power generation through different sources, however, is uneven. The thermal power contribution to this is around 63%, followed by hydropower contributing around 25%.

Cash Dubai has held above $48 a barrel for most of October, significantly higher than Platts\u2019 September average for the crude at $43.33 a barrel.', Source: Reuters', China diesel exports rise to record as refiners boost output', October 21, 2016.',  China\u2019s fuel exports rebounded in September, with diesel hitting a record, as refiners increased output following seasonal maintenance. The world\u2019s largest energy consumer exported 1.6 million metric tons of diesel last month, according to data released by the General Administration of Customs. Shipments averaged almost 397,900 barrels a day, more than 50 percent higher from a month earlier. Domestic diesel production gained 3 percent from August to 3.58 million barrels a day, the National Bureau of Statistics data show.', Source: Bloomberg', Woodside quarterly sales drop 9 percent amid declining energy prices', October 20, 2016.',  Woodside Petroleum Ltd, the Australian oil and gas producer, posted a 9 percent drop in third-quarter revenue amid the worst energy price slump in a generation. Sales slid to $988 million from $1.09 billion a year earlier, the Perth-based company said. Output was little changed at 25.2 million barrels of oil equivalent. The producer narrowed its 2016 production guidance to a range of 92 million to 95 million barrels of oil equivalent from the previous band of 90 million to 95 million barrels.', Source: Bloomberg', Gabon oil workers strike cuts output from Onal field', October 20, 2016.',  A strike in Gabon by oil workers at French company Maurel and Prom has cut production from the Onal field to 10,000 barrels per day from 28,000 bpd normally, according to the oil ministry. The strike, which started and began affecting oil production, was related to staff being laid off for missing work during a period of unrest after the presidential election, the Gabon oil workers union ONEP said. Work has also been impacted at the Coucal oil field, the ministry and ONEP said. ONEP has threatened a general oil strike if the eleven workers were not allowed to return to work. Gabon is an OPEC member and Africa\u2019s fourth largest producer with an output of around 220,000 barrels per day, dominated by international oil majors Total and Royal Dutch Shell.', Source: Reuters', US refinery margins fall in four of five regions: Credit Suisse', October 19, 2016.',  Refining margins fell in four of the five US regional petroleum districts in the week ended October 14, Credit Suisse said. Margins in the Midwest region fell the most, falling $4.76 to $11.68 per barrel, followed by the Gulf Coast region, with a decrease of $1.40 to $11.36 per barrel. Margins in the East Coast (Brent) region were down 92 cents at $9.87 per barrel. West Coast region margins were down 28 cents at $20.35 per barrel, while Rockies region margins rose 87 cents to $24.92 per barrel.', Source: Reuters', Iran talking with 16 investors to bid on O&G projects', October 19, 2016.',  Iran is negotiating with 16 international energy companies to help operate and manage 50 oil and gas (O&G) projects around the country to boost production after years of international sanctions. The projects are feasible even with oil at $40 a barrel, the National Iranian Oil Co. (NIOC) said. The South Azadegan field on Iran\u2019s southwestern border will be the first deal announced, and probably needs $10 billion to add 600,000 barrels a day of output, NIOC said.', Source: Bloomberg', International: GAS', Russia says ready to subsidize gas supplies to Belarus', October 25, 2016.',  Russia will subsidize natural gas supplies to Belarus after Minsk settles an outstanding debt for past supplies, Russia\u2019s Deputy Finance Minister Sergei Storchak said. The two countries have been at odds since the start of the year over how much Belarus should pay Gazprom for its gas after a slump in global energy prices. Belarus said that it was poised to give Russia $280 million to cover shortfalls. Gazprom has previously charged Belarus $132 per 1,000 cubic meters of gas.', Source: Reuters', US O&G producers stir from hibernation', October 24, 2016.',  United States (US) oil and gas (O&G) drillers are reporting the biggest and most sustained upturn since oil prices began slumping in the middle of 2014. The number of rigs drilling across the country has risen by 149, or 40 percent, since hitting a cyclical low at the end of May, according to oilfield services company Baker Hughes. The active rig count has risen in 18 of the last 21 weeks confirming that a sustained upturn in drilling is occurring. Most of the extra rigs are targeting oil-rich formations (127) rather than gas-bearing formations (21) though most wells will produce a mix of hydrocarbons.', Source: Reuters', Macquarie closes its London O&G investment desk', October 21, 2016.',  Australia\u2019s top investment bank Macquarie Group has closed its London-based upstream oil and gas (O&G) advisory after a sharp drop in global deal making in recent years. The business, which oversaw the oil and gas production sector in Europe, Middle East and Africa, and which consisted of eight employees, was closed. Three members of the upstream team will move to the Macquarie Capital\u2019s midstream oil and gas investment service under Ed Winter, which focuses on energy infrastructure such as pipelines and storage. Macquarie continues to have exposure to the oil sector through its commodities and financial markets team that runs hedging programs and reserves based loans for companies.', Source: Reuters', Indonesia considers Inpex request to boost Masela LNG output again', October 21, 2016.',  Indonesia expects to decide within \u201cone or two weeks\u201d on a plan by Inpex Corp to increase proposed output from the Masela natural gas field to nearly four times the level originally slated. President Joko Widodo in March rejected a $15 billion plan by Inpex and Shell to develop the world\u2019s largest floating liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility to process gas from Masela, saying an onshore plant would benefit the local economy more. The move was a blow to both companies and pushed the anticipated start of production from the field into the late 2020s. Indonesia gets priority on a large portion of domestically produced LNG, but development of infrastructure to absorb the fuel has been slower than hoped both locally and abroad, putting pressure on gas prices. Inpex is also working with BP, Mitsubishi Corp, China Natinoal Offshore Oil Co and other companies on an $8 billion expansion of the Tangguh project in West Papua province that will boost the project\u2019s annual LNG production capacity by 50 percent. Questions remain on how quickly Indonesia can develop infrastructure to absorb gas from these projects, with at least 60 uncommitted cargoes this year and next.', Source: Reuters', PetroChina said to mull raising gas prices as NDRC urges supply', October 20, 2016.',  PetroChina Co. is considering raising non-residential natural gas prices, while China\u2019s top economic planner has urged major suppliers to raise output, as the country seeks to avoid shortages during the peak winter season. The country\u2019s biggest gas producer and distributor plans to boost prices for industrial and commercial users from as soon as November 20, the earliest possible date it\u2019s allowed to under regulations issued by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC). PetroChina plans to raise prices by between 10 percent and 20 percent. The NDRC called on China\u2019s major natural gas producers, including China National Petroleum Corp, China Petrochemical Corp and China National Offshore Oil Corp, to increase output to alleviate tight supplies in the north and northwest regions.  PetroChina\u2019s planned price increase is partially designed to alleviate gas shortages in the northern provinces, where PetroChina expects to see tight supplies because of high winter-heating demand. China\u2019s natural-gas imports surged to a record last month. China imported 5.73 million metric tons of the fuel in September, the General Administration of Customs said.', Source: Bloomberg', Shell selling 16 upstream assets worth more than $500 mn', October 19, 2016.',  Royal Dutch Shell is currently offering 16 assets worth more than $500 million for sale as part of its vast $30 billion three-year asset sales program, the oil and gas company\u2019s head of upstream Andy Brown said. The Anglo-Dutch company launched the program to reduce its debt following the acquisition of BG Group.', Source: Reuters', International: Coal', China will postpone new coal-fired power plant construction', October 24, 2016. ', The National Energy Administration (NEA) of China has announced new restrictions on the construction of coal-fired power plants, postponing the construction of some projects that have already secured approval, or simply cancelling them. The agency will also stop projects having started construction in 2016 and will reassess the schedule for those whose construction started in 2015.', Source: Enerdata', CEZ sells 296 MW Tisova coal-fired plant in the Czech Republic', October 24, 2016. ', Czech energy group CEZ has reached an agreement with coal mining group Sokolovska uhelna, putting an end to their long commercial disputes and paving the way for further cooperation in future generation of power and heat from the brown coal extracted in the Sokolov region (Czech Republic). Under the terms of the agreement, CEZ will sell its 296 MW Tisova coal-fired power plant to Sokolovska uhelna, which consists of two units commissioned in 1958 and 1960, respectively.', Source: Enerdata', China\u2019s utilities beg for coal as supply expansions yet to kick in', October 21, 2016.',  China\u2019s electric power utilities are scrambling to get coal from anywhere they can, but are coming up short as efforts to boost supply take time to come into effect. China\u2019s government in September ordered miners to boost thermal coal output by 1 million tonnes per day, but it will take months before new supplies from the recent reopening of mines hits the market. Additionally, new rules on trucking have caused logjams in deliveries and transportation price spikes while suppliers at home and abroad are digging in for ever-higher prices. Beijing\u2019s steps to boost coal supplies have done little to derail the months-long price rally. South China coal futures prices hit record highs this week above $85 per tonne, up by 21 percent since the start of the month.', Source: Reuters', US coal industry hopes for respite after perfect storm', October 20, 2016.',  US coal producers have been struck by a range of structural and cyclical factors that hit consumption hard and forced many of them to seek bankruptcy protection during 2015 and 2016.

It will overtake France to have the second-highest number of nuclear reactors by 2020, Agneta Rising, the WNA said. In Asia, 134 operable reactors generated 400 terawatt-hours of electricity in 2015, making up 16 percent of global nuclear generation, the WNA said. Another 39 reactors comprising 47.4 GW are currently under construction in Asia, which comprises nearly two-thirds of global reactor construction. China makes up the bulk with 20 reactors under construction. New reactor construction is mostly led by industrializing countries which have enjoyed high levels of economic growth with an accompanying increase in energy demand, the WNA said. Four countries are expected to account for 70 percent of reactors commissioned in the period to 2030, which are China, Russia, India and South Korea.', Source: Reuters', Humanity enters \u2018new era of climate change\u2019 as CO', 2',  levels break all records: WMO', October 25, 2016.',  The world has now entered a new climate reality era, with average concentration of carbon dioxide (CO', 2) ', expected to remain above the threshold level of 400 parts per million throughout 2016, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). According to the Guardian, WMO bulletin reveals that in 2015, for the first time, CO', 2 ', levels in the atmosphere were at 400 parts per million (ppm) on average across the year as a whole. World\u2019s longest established greenhouse gas monitoring station at Mauna Loa in Hawaii estimates CO', 2 ', concentrations in atmosphere will stay above the symbolic 400ppm for the whole of 2016 and reach new highs. It will not dip below the 400ppm mark again for many generations, the experts said.', Source: Zee News', Masdar to build 200 MW solar project in Jordan', October 24, 2016.',  Abu Dhabi\u2019s renewable energy company Masdar has signed an agreement to supply power from the proposed 200 MW photovoltaic (PV) solar plant in Jordan to National Electric Power Company (NEPCO). The new solar plant, which will be linked to Al Muwaqqar substation located approximately 10 km outside Amman, is expected to generate electricity required to power around 110,000 homes annually. The project is also expected to reduce about 360,000 tons of CO', 2',  emissions annually. In December 2015, Jordan Wind Project Company has commissioned the 117 MW Tafila wind farm in the country.

', The French government has decided not to introduce a carbon price floor of around \u20ac30 per tonne as of 1 January 2017. That carbon price floor was proposed in the 2017 finance bill, that was due to be adopted by the Parliament in November 2016. It would have applied on the basis of CO', 2',  emissions, but operators of gas-fired power plants such as Engie claimed that the measure would raise production costs and make French plants less competitive compared with foreign plants. In the summer 2016, the carbon price floor proposal was thus restricted to coal-fired power plants, which account for less than 2% of power generation. The United Kingdom has already introduced a domestic carbon floor price of around \u20ac258 per tonne, while Germany and several other European countries are considering a floor price for carbon emissions, an option that is increasingly supported by investment funds and companies. Since 2008, carbon prices under the European Emissions Trading System have fallen from around \u20ac30 per tonne to \u20ac6 per tonne due to a glut in emission permits.', Source: Enerdata', Exxon heads for courtroom faceoff with New York in climate probe', October 21, 2016.',  Exxon Mobil Corp is headed to a courtroom in New York for the first time to try to block the state\u2019s demand for accounting documents about how climate change will affect its finances.
