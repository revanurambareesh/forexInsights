', Morphology and volcanology', [', edit', ]', 
', u"Many kimberlites are emplaced as carrot-shaped, vertical intrusions termed 'pipes' (", kimberlite pipes', ). This classic carrot shape is formed due to a complex intrusive process of kimberlitic magma which inherits a large proportion of CO', 2',  (lower amounts of H', 2', O) in the system, which produces a deep explosive boiling stage that causes a significant amount of vertical flaring (Bergman, 1987). Kimberlite classification is based on the recognition of differing rock ', facies', . These differing facies are associated with a particular style of magmatic activity, namely crater, diatreme and ', hypabyssal',  rocks (Clement and Skinner 1985, and Clement, 1982).', 
', The ', morphology',  of kimberlite pipes, and the classical carrot shape, is the result of explosive ', diatreme',  ', volcanism',  from very deep ', mantle', -derived sources. These volcanic explosions produce vertical columns of rock that rise from deep magma reservoirs. The morphology of kimberlite pipes is varied but generally includes a sheeted dyke complex of tabular, vertically dipping feeder dykes in the root of the pipe which extends down to the mantle. Within 1.5\u20132 km (0.93\u20131.24 mi) of the surface, the highly pressured magma explodes upwards and expands to form a conical to cylindrical ', diatreme', , which erupts to the surface. The surface expression is rarely preserved, but is usually similar to a ', maar volcano', . The diameter of a kimberlite pipe at the surface is typically a few hundred meters to a kilometer (up to 0.6 mile).', 
', Two ', Jurassic',  kimberlite ', dikes',  exist in ', Pennsylvania', . One, the Gates-Adah Dike, outcrops on the ', Monongahela River',  on the border of ', Fayette',  and ', Greene',  Counties. The other, the Dixonville-Tanoma Dike in central ', Indiana',  County, does not outcrop at the surface and was discovered by miners.', [1]', 
', Petrology', [', edit', ]', 
', Both the location and origin of kimberlitic magmas are areas of contention. Their extreme enrichment and geochemistry has led to a large amount of speculation about their origin, with models placing their source within the sub-continental lithospheric mantle (SCLM) or even as deep as the transition zone. The mechanism of enrichment has also been the topic of interest with models including partial melting, assimilation of subducted sediment or derivation from a primary magma source.', 
', u"Historically, kimberlites have been subdivided into two distinct varieties termed 'basaltic' and 'micaceous' based primarily on petrographic observations (Wagner, 1914). This was later revised by Smith (1983) who renamed these divisions Group I and Group II based on the isotopic affinities of these rocks using the Nd, Sr and Pb systems. Mitchell (1995) later proposed that these group I and II kimberlites display such distinct differences, that they may not be as closely related as once thought. He showed that Group II kimberlites actually show closer affinities to ", lamproites',  than they do to Group I kimberlites. Hence, he reclassified Group II kimberlites as orangeites to prevent confusion.', 
', Group I kimberlites', [', edit', ]', 
', Group-I kimberlites are of CO', 2', -rich ', ultramafic',  potassic igneous rocks dominated by primary ', forsteritic olivine',  and carbonate minerals, with a trace mineral assemblage of magnesian ', ilmenite', , chromium ', pyrope', , ', almandine', -pyrope, chromium ', diopside',  (in some cases subcalcic), ', phlogopite', , ', enstatite',  and of Ti-poor ', chromite', . Group I kimberlites exhibit a distinctive inequigranular texture caused by macrocrystic (0.5\u201310 mm or 0.020\u20130.394 in) to megacrystic (10\u2013200 mm or 0.39\u20137.87 in) phenocrysts of olivine, pyrope, chromian diopside, magnesian ilmenite and phlogopite, in a fine to medium grained groundmass.', 
', The groundmass mineralogy, which more closely resembles a true composition of the igneous rock, is dominated by carbonate and significant amounts of forsteritic olivine, with lesser amounts of pyrope garnet, Cr-', diopside', , magnesian ilmenite and ', spinel', .', 
', Olivine Lamproites', [', edit', ]', 
', Olivine Lamproites were previously called Group II kimberlite or orangeite in response to the mistaken belief that they only occurred in South Africa. Their occurrence and petrology, however, are identical globally and should not be erroneously referred to as kimberlite.', [2]',  Olivine lamproites are ', ultrapotassic', , ', peralkaline rocks',  rich in volatiles (dominantly H', 2', O). The distinctive characteristic of olivine lamproites is ', phlogopite',  macrocrysts and microphenocrysts, together with groundmass micas that vary in composition from phlogopite to "tetraferriphlogopite" (anomalously Al-poor phlogopite requiring Fe to enter the tetrahedral site). Resorbed olivine macrocrysts and euhedral primary crystals of groundmass olivine are common but not essential constituents.', 
', Characteristic primary phases in the groundmass include: zoned pyroxenes (cores of diopside rimmed by Ti-aegirine); spinel-group minerals (magnesian ', chromite',  to titaniferous ', magnetite', ); Sr- and ', REE', -rich ', perovskite', ; Sr-rich ', apatite', ; REE-rich phosphates (', monazite', , daqingshanite); potassian barian ', hollandite',  group minerals; Nb-bearing ', rutile',  and Mn-bearing ', ilmenite', .', 
', Kimberlitic indicator minerals', [', edit', ]', 
', Kimberlites are peculiar igneous rocks because they contain a variety of mineral species with chemical compositions that indicate they formed under high pressure and temperature within the mantle. These minerals such as chromium diopside (a ', pyroxene', ), chromium spinels, magnesian ilmenite, and pyrope garnets rich in chromium, are generally absent from most other igneous rocks, making them particularly useful as indicators for kimberlites.', 
', These indicator minerals are generally sought in stream sediments in modern ', alluvial material', . Their presence may indicate the presence of a kimberlite within the erosional watershed which produced the alluvium.',

', Economic importance', [', edit', ]', 
', Kimberlites are the most important source of primary ', diamonds', . Many kimberlite pipes also produce rich ', alluvial',  or ', eluvial',  diamond ', placer deposits', . About 6,400 kimberlite pipes have been discovered in the world, of those about 900 have been classified as diamondiferous, and of those just over 30 have been economic enough to diamond mine.', [5]', 
', The deposits occurring at ', Kimberley', , ', South Africa',  were the first recognized and the source of the name. The Kimberley ', diamonds',  were originally found in ', weathered',  kimberlite which was colored yellow by ', limonite', , and so was called ', yellow ground', . Deeper workings encountered less altered rock, ', serpentinized',  kimberlite, which miners call ', blue ground', .', 
', See also ', Mir Mine',  and ', Udachnaya pipe', , both in ', Sakha Republic', , ', Siberia', .', 
', u"The blue and yellow ground were both prolific producers of diamonds. After the yellow ground had been exhausted, miners in the late 19th century accidentally cut into the blue ground and found gem quality diamonds in quantity. The economic importance of the time was such that, with a flood of diamonds being found, the miners undercut each other's prices and eventually decreased the diamonds' value down to cost in a short time.", [6]',

This was later revised by Smith (1983) who renamed these divisions Group I and Group II based on the isotopic affinities of these rocks using the Nd, Sr and Pb systems. Mitchell (1995) later proposed that these group I and II kimberlites display such distinct differences, that they may not be as closely related as once thought. He showed that Group II kimberlites actually show closer affinities to ", lamproites',  than they do to Group I kimberlites. Hence, he reclassified Group II kimberlites as orangeites to prevent confusion.', 
', Group I kimberlites', [', edit', ]', 
', Group-I kimberlites are of CO', 2', -rich ', ultramafic',  potassic igneous rocks dominated by primary ', forsteritic olivine',  and carbonate minerals, with a trace mineral assemblage of magnesian ', ilmenite', , chromium ', pyrope', , ', almandine', -pyrope, chromium ', diopside',  (in some cases subcalcic), ', phlogopite', , ', enstatite',  and of Ti-poor ', chromite', . Group I kimberlites exhibit a distinctive inequigranular texture caused by macrocrystic (0.5\u201310 mm or 0.020\u20130.394 in) to megacrystic (10\u2013200 mm or 0.39\u20137.87 in) phenocrysts of olivine, pyrope, chromian diopside, magnesian ilmenite and phlogopite, in a fine to medium grained groundmass.', 
', The groundmass mineralogy, which more closely resembles a true composition of the igneous rock, is dominated by carbonate and significant amounts of forsteritic olivine, with lesser amounts of pyrope garnet, Cr-', diopside', , magnesian ilmenite and ', spinel', .', 
', Olivine Lamproites', [', edit', ]', 
', Olivine Lamproites were previously called Group II kimberlite or orangeite in response to the mistaken belief that they only occurred in South Africa. Their occurrence and petrology, however, are identical globally and should not be erroneously referred to as kimberlite.', [2]',  Olivine lamproites are ', ultrapotassic', , ', peralkaline rocks',  rich in volatiles (dominantly H', 2', O). The distinctive characteristic of olivine lamproites is ', phlogopite',  macrocrysts and microphenocrysts, together with groundmass micas that vary in composition from phlogopite to "tetraferriphlogopite" (anomalously Al-poor phlogopite requiring Fe to enter the tetrahedral site). Resorbed olivine macrocrysts and euhedral primary crystals of groundmass olivine are common but not essential constituents.', 
', Characteristic primary phases in the groundmass include: zoned pyroxenes (cores of diopside rimmed by Ti-aegirine); spinel-group minerals (magnesian ', chromite',  to titaniferous ', magnetite', ); Sr- and ', REE', -rich ', perovskite', ; Sr-rich ', apatite', ; REE-rich phosphates (', monazite', , daqingshanite); potassian barian ', hollandite',  group minerals; Nb-bearing ', rutile',  and Mn-bearing ', ilmenite', .', 
', Kimberlitic indicator minerals', [', edit', ]', 
', Kimberlites are peculiar igneous rocks because they contain a variety of mineral species with chemical compositions that indicate they formed under high pressure and temperature within the mantle. These minerals such as chromium diopside (a ', pyroxene', ), chromium spinels, magnesian ilmenite, and pyrope garnets rich in chromium, are generally absent from most other igneous rocks, making them particularly useful as indicators for kimberlites.', 
', These indicator minerals are generally sought in stream sediments in modern ', alluvial material', . Their presence may indicate the presence of a kimberlite within the erosional watershed which produced the alluvium.',

', Economic importance', [', edit', ]', 
', Kimberlites are the most important source of primary ', diamonds', . Many kimberlite pipes also produce rich ', alluvial',  or ', eluvial',  diamond ', placer deposits', . About 6,400 kimberlite pipes have been discovered in the world, of those about 900 have been classified as diamondiferous, and of those just over 30 have been economic enough to diamond mine.', [5]', 
', The deposits occurring at ', Kimberley', , ', South Africa',  were the first recognized and the source of the name. The Kimberley ', diamonds',  were originally found in ', weathered',  kimberlite which was colored yellow by ', limonite', , and so was called ', yellow ground', . Deeper workings encountered less altered rock, ', serpentinized',  kimberlite, which miners call ', blue ground', .', 
', See also ', Mir Mine',  and ', Udachnaya pipe', , both in ', Sakha Republic', , ', Siberia', .', 
', u"The blue and yellow ground were both prolific producers of diamonds. After the yellow ground had been exhausted, miners in the late 19th century accidentally cut into the blue ground and found gem quality diamonds in quantity. The economic importance of the time was such that, with a flood of diamonds being found, the miners undercut each other's prices and eventually decreased the diamonds' value down to cost in a short time.", [6]',
