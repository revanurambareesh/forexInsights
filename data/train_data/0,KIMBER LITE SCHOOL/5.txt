Kimberlite magmas are of economic and scientific importance because they
represent the major host to diamonds and are probably the deepest magmas
from continental regions. In addition, kimberlite magmas transport
abundant mantle and crustal xenoliths, thus providing fundamental
information on the composition of the sub-continental lithosphere.
Despite their importance, the composition and ascent mechanism(s) of
kimberlite melts remain poorly constrained. Phlogopite is one of the few
minerals that preserves a history of fluid migration and magmatism in
the mantle and crust and is therefore an invaluable petrogenetic
indicator of kimberlite magma evolution.', 

Here we present major and trace element compositional data for
phlogopite from the Bultfontein kimberlite (Kimberley, South Africa;
i.e. the kimberlite type-locality) and from entrained mantle xenoliths.
Phlogopite macrocrysts (~ > 0.3-0.5 mm) and microcrysts (between ~
0.1 and 0.3 mm) in the Bultfontein kimberlite display concentric
compositional zoning patterns. The cores of these phlogopite grains
exhibit compositions typical of phlogopite contained in peridotite
mantle xenoliths. However, the rims of some grains show compositions
analogous to kimberlite groundmass phlogopite (i.e. high Ti, Al and Ba;
low Cr), whereas other rims and intermediate zones (between cores and
rims) exhibit unusually elevated Cr and lower Al and Ba concentrations.
The latter compositions are indistinguishable from matrix phlogopite in
polymict breccia xenoliths (considered to represent failed kimberlite
intrusions) and from Ti-rich overgrowth rims on phlogopite in other
mantle xenoliths. Consequently, it is likely that these phlogopite
grains crystallized from kimberlite melts and that the high Ti-Cr zones
originated from earlier kimberlite melts at mantle depths.', u"

We postulate that successive pulses of ascending kimberlite magma
progressively metasomatised the conduit along which later kimberlite
pulses ascended, producing progressively decreasing interaction with the
surrounding mantle rocks. In our view, these processes represent the
fundamental mechanism of kimberlite magma ascent. Our study also
indicates that, in addition to xenoliths/xenocrysts and magmatic phases,
kimberlite rocks incorporate material crystallized at various mantle
depths by previous kimberlite intrusions (mantle-derived 'antecrysts').
