', The first, and most notable, of the American Modern Schools was founded in New York City, in 1911, two years after Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia\u2019s execution for ', sedition',  in monarchist Spain on 18 October 1909. Commonly called the ', Ferrer Center', , it was founded by notable anarchists \u2014 including ', Leonard Abbott', , ', Alexander Berkman', , ', Voltairine de Cleyre', , and ', Emma Goldman',  \u2014 first meeting on ', u"St. Mark's Place", , in Manhattan\u2019s ', Lower East Side', , but twice moved elsewhere, first within lower Manhattan, then to ', Harlem', . The Ferrer Center opened with only nine students, one being the son of ', Margaret Sanger', , the ', contraceptives', -rights activist. ', Man Ray', , too, was a student.', 
', Starting in 1912, the school\u2019s principal was the philosopher ', Will Durant', , who also taught there. Besides Berkman and Goldman, the Ferrer Center faculty included the ', Ashcan School',  painters ', Robert Henri',  and ', George Bellows', , and its guest lecturers included writers and political activists such as Margaret Sanger, ', Jack London', , and ', Upton Sinclair', .', [1]',  Student Magda Schoenwetter, recalled that the school used ', Montessori',  methods and equipment, and emphasised academic freedom rather than fixed subjects, such as spelling and arithmetic.', [2]',

', The Modern School',  magazine, Spring, 1920', 
', 
', 
', In July 1914, radical anarchists who frequented the Ferrer Center, and loosely associated with its adult education program, plotted to bomb the mansion of tycoon industrialist ', John D. Rockefeller', . On failing to enter the Rockefeller estate, they took the bomb back to the Lexington Avenue apartment of ', Louise Berger',  (a school habitué and an editor of the ', Mother Earth Bulletin', ), where it exploded, killing four people, including three of the bombers, and wounding many others, and brought political notoriety upon the Ferrer Center.', [3]', 
', Other Modern Schools', [', edit', ]', 
', After the 4 July 1914 ', Lexington Avenue bombing', , the police investigated and several times raided the Ferrer Center and other labor and anarchist organisations in New York City.', [3]',  Acknowledging the urban danger to their school, the organizers bought 68 acres (275,000 m²) in ', Piscataway Township, New Jersey', , and moved there in 1914, becoming the center of the Stelton Colony. Moreover, beyond New York City, the ', Ferrer Colony and Modern School',  was founded (ca. 1910\u20131915) as a Modern School-based community, that endured some forty years.', 
', In 1933, James and Nellie Dick, who earlier had been principals of the Stelton Modern School, founded the Modern School in ', Lakewood, New Jersey', ,', [3]',  which survived the original Modern School, the Ferrer Center, becoming the final surviving such school, lasting until 1958.', [4]', 
', The Modern School',  magazine', [', edit', ]', 
', The Modern School',  magazine originally began as a newsletter for parents, when the school was in New York City, printed with the manual ', printing press',  used in teaching printing as a profession. After moving to the Stelton Colony, New Jersey, the magazine\u2019s content expanded to poetry, prose, art, and ', libertarian education',  articles; the cover emblem and interior graphics were designed by ', Rockwell Kent', . Artists and writers, among them ', Hart Crane',  and ', Wallace Stevens', , praised ', The Modern School',  as \u201cthe most beautifully printed magazine in existence.\u201d',
