', In 1856, ', Harvard University', -educated ', physician',  and ', Boston Brahmin',  George Cheyne Shattuck, inspired by the educational theories of ', Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi', ,', [11]',  turned his country home in the hamlet of Millville, New Hampshire into a school for boys.', [12]',  Shattuck wanted his boys educated in the austere, bucolic countryside. A newly appointed board of trustees chose Henry Coit, a 24-year-old clergyman, to preside over the school for its first 39 years.', [13]', u" In addition to Shattuck's two boys and Coit and his wife there was one other student.", [14]',  The original location was 50 acres, but over the years surrounding lands were acquired.', [15]', 
', Throughout the latter half of the 19th century, the school expanded. In 1884, it built the first ', squash',  courts in America. During the infancy of ice hockey in the United States, the school established itself as a powerhouse that often played and beat collegiate teams at Harvard and Yale.', [13]',  Its Lower School Pond once held nine hockey rinks. By 1895, when Coit died, the school had 35 teachers and 345 students.', [14]', 
', In 1910, ', Samuel Smith Drury',  took over as rector. Drury, who had served as a missionary in the ', Philippines', , found St. Paul's in almost all aspects \u2014 student body, faculty, and curriculum \u2014 severely lacking a serious commitment to academic pursuits and moral upstandingness. Accordingly, he presided over, among other things, the hiring of better teachers, the tightening of academic standards, and the dissolution of secret societies and their replacement with a student council. Drury also presided over the school throughout the 1920s and 1930s during what August Hecksher called its "', Augustan',  era".', [13]', 
', u"Thirty years later, the 1960s ushered in a turbulent period for St. Paul's. In 1968, students wrote an acerbic manifesto describing the school administration as an oppressive regime. As a result of this manifesto, seated meals were reduced from three times a day to four times a week, courses were shortened to be terms (rather than years) long, Chapel was reduced to four times a week, and the school's grading system was changed to eliminate + and - grades and given its current High Honors, Honors, High Pass, Pass, and Unsatisfactory labels instead of A\u2013F.", [16]', u" By the end of the sixties, St. Paul's had begun to admit sizable numbers of minorities in every class, had secularized its previously strict religious schedule considerably, expanded its course offerings, and was poised to begin ", coeducation', . It admitted girls for the first time in 1971.', [17]', 
', A new library, designed by ', Robert A. M. Stern',  and Carroll Cline,', [18]',  opened in 1991; a $24 million, 95,000 sq. ft. Athletic & Fitness Center', [19]', [20]',  opened in 2004. The school celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2006. The new $50 million science and math building \u2014 the Lindsay Center \u2014 opened in fall 2011.', [21]', 
', The modern school, in addition to students drawn from the ', highest levels of American society',  and international elites, serves a ', diverse',  body of students from ethnic groups in the United States.', [22]',

', The school's rural 2,000-acre (809 ha) campus is familiarly known as "Millville", after a now-abandoned mill whose relic still stands in the woods near the Lower School Pond. The overwhelming majority of the land comprises wild and wooded areas. The campus itself includes four ponds and the upper third of the ', Turkey River', .', 
', u"There are 18 dorms, nine boys' and nine girls', which each house between 20 and 40 students and are vertically integrated: every dorm has members of all four forms. The architecture of the dormitories varies from the ", Collegiate Gothic',  style of the "Quad" dorms (built in 1927)', [23]',  to the spare, ', modern',  style of the Kittredge building (built in the early seventies).', [24]', 
', Classes are held in five buildings: language and humanities classes meet in the Schoolhouse; math and science classes in the Lindsay Family Center for Mathematics and Science; visual arts in Hargate; music and ballet classes in the Oates Performing Arts Center; and theater classes, in the New Space ', black box theater', . The Schoolhouse, Moore and the Lindsay Center form a quadrangle, along with Memorial Hall, the 600-seat theater used for all school gatherings not suited to the chapel space.', 
', The Ohrstrom library houses approximately 75,000 books', [25]',  and overlooks the Lower School Pond. Perhaps the focal point of the campus is the Chapel of St. Peter and St. Paul, constructed in the late 19th century, also known as the New Chapel. There is an Old Chapel, too small now to accommodate the entire facility and student body.', [26]',

', u"Rather than having physical education classes, St. Paul's requires all its students to play sports. These sports range from the internationally competing crew team to intramural hockey.", 
', Three Tuesdays a month during the Fall and Winter terms and every Tuesday and Thursday during the Spring term, students attend seated meal, at which formal attire is required. Seven students and a faculty member are randomly assigned to each table for a family-style dinner, and the table is excused only after everyone has eaten. In the winter, students have dinner with their advisors and advisee groups (a group of 5-6 students are assigned a faculty member to be their advisor), either at the advisors home or at the Upper Dining Hall. The school supplies money for one meal in town.', 
', In the evenings, meetings are held for clubs and activities, music ensembles like the Chorus and Band, theater rehearsals, ', a cappella',  groups (the all-male Testostertones, the all-female Mad Hatters, and the co-ed Deli Line), the Debate Team, and other extracurriculars.',

', According to ', Shamus Khan', , author of ', u"Privilege: The Making of an Adolescent Elite at St. Paul's School",  and a ', sociologist', u" who is a St. Paul's alumnus, students are ", socialized',  to function as privileged holders of power and status in an open society. Privilege in ', meritocracy',  is acquired through talent, hard work, and a wide variety of cultural and social experiences.', [28]',  ', Economic inequality',  and ', social inequality',  are explained by the lack of talent, hard work, and limited cultural and social experience of the less privileged. Thus high status is earned, not based on entitlement.', [29]',  According to Khan, "Today what is distinct among the elite is not their exclusivity but their ease within and broad acceptance of a more open world."', [30]',

', u"St. Paul's is home to many long-standing traditions. Near the start of the school year, the Rector announces a surprise holiday \u2014 Cricket Holiday \u2014 in morning Chapel. Classes are canceled for the day and the Rector leads new students and faculty on a tour of the woods surrounding the School. Tuesdays are generally preferred for the holiday by the Rector as students who leave the grounds are forced to return by the start time of Seated Meal or Advisee Dinner. The tradition dates back to the first Rector, Henry Augustus Coit, who preferred ", cricket',  over ', baseball',  as a "more refined sport."', 
', During February, the Missionary Society (the school's community service organization) plans and announces Mish Holiday. The holiday is announced the day before, the evening is given over to a theme dance, and the next day is a day off from school. The Missionary Society has used extravagant stunts to announce the holiday, including, in recent years, fireworks over the Lower School Pond and a plane trailing a "Happy Mish!" banner.', 
', Students at St. Paul's are assigned to one of three "clubs" for their time at St. Paul's \u2014 "Isthmian," "Delphian" or "Old Hundred". Those who participate in "club sports" (intramural) play for their club. Students who participate in crew are also assigned to one of two "Boat Clubs" \u2014 "Halcyon" or "Shattuck". Descendants of graduates are assigned to the same clubs as their relatives.', 
', The annual Inter-House Inter-Club Race, known among students as the "Dorm Run" but now officially named the "Charles B. Morgan Run", takes place late in Fall Term, usually in early to mid-November. Students are invited to earn points for their dorm and club by running in a 2-mile (3.2 km) cross country race. The current student record is 9:48, set in 2006 by Peter Harrison '07.', [34]', 
', During a weekend in the Fall Term, the Student Council holds Fall Ball, a dinner/dance known among students as the Cocktails. On the same night, there is a talent show that focuses on fifth formers (eleventh graders). Fifth former "MCs" are elected by their form to host the show.', 
', During the Winter Term, the school holds the annual Fiske Cup Competition. Each participating dorm produces a student-directed and performed play. Most plays are held in dorm common rooms.', 
', u"In the Spring Term, the school holds a school-wide public speaking contest called the Hugh Camp Cup. The finalists' speeches are delivered before the entire school, and the student body votes on a winner, whose name is engraved on the prize. Alumnus ", John Kerry',  achieved this distinction during his sixth form year.', [35]', u" Recent winners include Tiger Gao '17 in 2014 and Stellan Bechtold '17 in 2015.", 
', u"On the last night of the term, students gather in the Chapel at 9 p.m. for the Last Night service. At the Last Night service for Spring Term, the last night of school before summer vacation, the faculty lines up outside the Chapel after the service and students shake hands with every member as they exit. On the Sixth Formers' last night on campus, they gather as a class in the Old Chapel. At the conclusion of the service, the rest of the student body waits outside to congratulate them and say their goodbyes.", 
', During Anniversary Weekend, held on the first weekend of June, alumni converge on the school for get-togethers, reunions, and the annual Alumni Parade.

', In 1856, ', Harvard University', -educated ', physician',  and ', Boston Brahmin',  George Cheyne Shattuck, inspired by the educational theories of ', Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi', ,', [11]',  turned his country home in the hamlet of Millville, New Hampshire into a school for boys.', [12]',  Shattuck wanted his boys educated in the austere, bucolic countryside. A newly appointed board of trustees chose Henry Coit, a 24-year-old clergyman, to preside over the school for its first 39 years.', [13]', u" In addition to Shattuck's two boys and Coit and his wife there was one other student.", [14]',  The original location was 50 acres, but over the years surrounding lands were acquired.', [15]', 
', Throughout the latter half of the 19th century, the school expanded. In 1884, it built the first ', squash',  courts in America. During the infancy of ice hockey in the United States, the school established itself as a powerhouse that often played and beat collegiate teams at Harvard and Yale.', [13]',  Its Lower School Pond once held nine hockey rinks. By 1895, when Coit died, the school had 35 teachers and 345 students.', [14]', 
', In 1910, ', Samuel Smith Drury',  took over as rector. Drury, who had served as a missionary in the ', Philippines', , found St. Paul's in almost all aspects \u2014 student body, faculty, and curriculum \u2014 severely lacking a serious commitment to academic pursuits and moral upstandingness. Accordingly, he presided over, among other things, the hiring of better teachers, the tightening of academic standards, and the dissolution of secret societies and their replacement with a student council. Drury also presided over the school throughout the 1920s and 1930s during what August Hecksher called its "', Augustan',  era".', [13]', 
', u"Thirty years later, the 1960s ushered in a turbulent period for St. Paul's. In 1968, students wrote an acerbic manifesto describing the school administration as an oppressive regime. As a result of this manifesto, seated meals were reduced from three times a day to four times a week, courses were shortened to be terms (rather than years) long, Chapel was reduced to four times a week, and the school's grading system was changed to eliminate + and - grades and given its current High Honors, Honors, High Pass, Pass, and Unsatisfactory labels instead of A\u2013F.", [16]', u" By the end of the sixties, St. Paul's had begun to admit sizable numbers of minorities in every class, had secularized its previously strict religious schedule considerably, expanded its course offerings, and was poised to begin ", coeducation', . It admitted girls for the first time in 1971.', [17]', 
', A new library, designed by ', Robert A. M. Stern',  and Carroll Cline,', [18]',  opened in 1991; a $24 million, 95,000 sq. ft. Athletic & Fitness Center', [19]', [20]',  opened in 2004. The school celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2006. The new $50 million science and math building \u2014 the Lindsay Center \u2014 opened in fall 2011.', [21]',

', u"There are 18 dorms, nine boys' and nine girls', which each house between 20 and 40 students and are vertically integrated: every dorm has members of all four forms. The architecture of the dormitories varies from the ", Collegiate Gothic',  style of the "Quad" dorms (built in 1927)', [23]',  to the spare, ', modern',  style of the Kittredge building (built in the early seventies).', [24]', 
', Classes are held in five buildings: language and humanities classes meet in the Schoolhouse; math and science classes in the Lindsay Family Center for Mathematics and Science; visual arts in Hargate; music and ballet classes in the Oates Performing Arts Center; and theater classes, in the New Space ', black box theater', . The Schoolhouse, Moore and the Lindsay Center form a quadrangle, along with Memorial Hall, the 600-seat theater used for all school gatherings not suited to the chapel space.', 
', The Ohrstrom library houses approximately 75,000 books', [25]',  and overlooks the Lower School Pond. Perhaps the focal point of the campus is the Chapel of St. Peter and St. Paul, constructed in the late 19th century, also known as the New Chapel. There is an Old Chapel, too small now to accommodate the entire facility and student body.', [26]',

Seven students and a faculty member are randomly assigned to each table for a family-style dinner, and the table is excused only after everyone has eaten. In the winter, students have dinner with their advisors and advisee groups (a group of 5-6 students are assigned a faculty member to be their advisor), either at the advisors home or at the Upper Dining Hall. The school supplies money for one meal in town.',

', u"St. Paul's is home to many long-standing traditions. Near the start of the school year, the Rector announces a surprise holiday \u2014 Cricket Holiday \u2014 in morning Chapel. Classes are canceled for the day and the Rector leads new students and faculty on a tour of the woods surrounding the School. Tuesdays are generally preferred for the holiday by the Rector as students who leave the grounds are forced to return by the start time of Seated Meal or Advisee Dinner. The tradition dates back to the first Rector, Henry Augustus Coit, who preferred ", cricket',  over ', baseball',  as a "more refined sport."', 
', During February, the Missionary Society (the school's community service organization) plans and announces Mish Holiday. The holiday is announced the day before, the evening is given over to a theme dance, and the next day is a day off from school. The Missionary Society has used extravagant stunts to announce the holiday, including, in recent years, fireworks over the Lower School Pond and a plane trailing a "Happy Mish!" banner.', 
', Students at St. Paul's are assigned to one of three "clubs" for their time at St. Paul's \u2014 "Isthmian," "Delphian" or "Old Hundred". Those who participate in "club sports" (intramural) play for their club. Students who participate in crew are also assigned to one of two "Boat Clubs" \u2014 "Halcyon" or "Shattuck". Descendants of graduates are assigned to the same clubs as their relatives.', 
', The annual Inter-House Inter-Club Race, known among students as the "Dorm Run" but now officially named the "Charles B. Morgan Run", takes place late in Fall Term, usually in early to mid-November. Students are invited to earn points for their dorm and club by running in a 2-mile (3.2 km) cross country race. The current student record is 9:48, set in 2006 by Peter Harrison '07.', [34]', 
', During a weekend in the Fall Term, the Student Council holds Fall Ball, a dinner/dance known among students as the Cocktails. On the same night, there is a talent show that focuses on fifth formers (eleventh graders). Fifth former "MCs" are elected by their form to host the show.', 
', During the Winter Term, the school holds the annual Fiske Cup Competition. Each participating dorm produces a student-directed and performed play. Most plays are held in dorm common rooms.', 
', u"In the Spring Term, the school holds a school-wide public speaking contest called the Hugh Camp Cup. The finalists' speeches are delivered before the entire school, and the student body votes on a winner, whose name is engraved on the prize.

', u"On the last night of the term, students gather in the Chapel at 9 p.m. for the Last Night service. At the Last Night service for Spring Term, the last night of school before summer vacation, the faculty lines up outside the Chapel after the service and students shake hands with every member as they exit. On the Sixth Formers' last night on campus, they gather as a class in the Old Chapel.
