The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) (also 
known as ISO 9362, SWIFT-BIC, BIC code, SWIFT ID or SWIFT code) is a standard 
format of Business Identifier Codes approved by the International Organization 
for Standardization (ISO). It is a unique identification code for both financial 
and non-financial institutions. (When assigned to a non-financial institution, a 
code may also be known as a Business Entity Identifier or BEI.) These codes are 
used when transferring money between banks, particularly for international wire 
transfers, and also for the exchange of other messages between banks. The codes 
can sometimes be found on account statements. SWIFT and BIC codes are basically 
the same.
