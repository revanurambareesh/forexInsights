It is bordered by ', Romania',  to the north, ', Serbia',  and ', Macedonia',  to the west, ', Greece',  and ', Turkey',  to the south, and the ', Black Sea', u" to the east. With a territory of 110,994 square kilometres (42,855 sq mi), Bulgaria is Europe's ", 16th-largest country', .', 
', Organised ', prehistoric',  cultures began developing on current Bulgarian lands during the ', Neolithic',  period. Its ancient history saw the presence of the ', Thracians', , ', Greeks',  and ', Romans', . The emergence of a unified Bulgarian state dates back to the establishment of the ', First Bulgarian Empire',  in 681 AD, which dominated most of the ', Balkans',  and functioned as a cultural hub for ', Slavs',  during the ', Middle Ages', . With the downfall of the ', Second Bulgarian Empire',  in 1396, its territories came under ', Ottoman',  rule for nearly five centuries. The ', Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u201378',  led to the formation of the Third Bulgarian State. The following years saw several conflicts with its neighbours, which prompted Bulgaria to align with Germany in both world wars. In 1946 it became a one-party ', socialist state',  as part of the Soviet-led ', Eastern Bloc', . In ', December 1989',  the ruling ', Communist Party',  allowed ', multi-party', u" elections, which subsequently led to Bulgaria's transition into a ", democracy',  and a market-based economy.', 
', u"Bulgaria's population of 7.4 million people is predominantly urbanised and mainly concentrated in the administrative centres of its ", 28 provinces', . Most commercial and cultural activities are centred on the capital and largest city, ', Sofia', . The strongest sectors of the economy are heavy industry, power engineering, and agriculture, all of which rely on local natural resources.', 
', u"The country's current political structure dates to the adoption of a democratic constitution in 1991. Bulgaria is a ", unitary',  ', parliamentary republic',  with a high degree of political, administrative, and economic centralisation. It is a member of the ', European Union', , ', NATO', , and the ', Council of Europe', ; a founding state of the ', Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe',  (OSCE); and has taken a seat at the ', UN Security Council',  three times.',

This ', conversion',  was followed by a Byzantine recognition of the ', Bulgarian church', [32]',  and the adoption of the ', Cyrillic alphabet',  developed at ', Preslav', [33]',  which strengthened central authority and helped fuse the Slavs and Bulgars into a unified people.', [34]', [35]',  A subsequent cultural golden age began during the 34-year rule of ', Simeon the Great', , who also achieved the largest territorial expansion of the state.', [36]',

The nobility was eliminated and the peasantry was ', enserfed',  to Ottoman masters,', [49]',  with much of the educated clergy fleeing to other countries.', [50]',  Under the Ottoman system, Christians were considered an ', inferior class',  of people. Thus, Bulgarians, like other Christians, were subjected to heavy taxes and a small portion of the Bulgarian populace experienced partial or complete ', Islamisation', ,', [51]',  and their culture was suppressed.', [50]',  Ottoman authorities established the Rum ', Millet', , a religious administrative community which governed all Orthodox Christians regardless of their ethnicity.', [52]',  Most of the local population gradually lost its distinct national consciousness, identifying as Christians.', [53]', [54]',  However, the clergy remaining in some isolated monasteries kept it alive, and that helped it to survive as in some rural, remote areas,', [55]',  as well as in the militant ', Catholic community',  in the northwestern part of the country.', [56]',

The Russian and Bulgarian ', defence of Shipka Pass',  was crucial for the independence of Bulgaria.', [59]', 
', 
', 
', The ', Treaty of San Stefano',  was signed on 3 March 1878 by Russia and the Ottoman Empire, and included a provision to set up an autonomous Bulgarian principality roughly on the territories of the Second Bulgarian Empire.', [60]', [61]',  The other ', Great Powers',  immediately rejected the treaty out of fear that such a large country in the Balkans might threaten their interests. It was superseded by the subsequent ', Treaty of Berlin', , signed on 13 July, provided for a much smaller state comprising ', Moesia',  and the region of ', Sofia', , leaving large populations of Bulgarians outside the new country.', [60]', [62]', u" This played a significant role in forming Bulgaria's militaristic approach to foreign affairs during the first half of the 20th century.", [63]', 
', The Bulgarian principality won ', a war against Serbia',  and incorporated the semi-autonomous Ottoman territory of ', Eastern Rumelia',  in 1885, proclaiming itself an independent state on 5 October 1908.', [64]',  In the years following independence, Bulgaria increasingly militarised and was often referred to as "the Balkan ', Prussia', ".', [65]', [66]', 
', Between 1912 and 1918, Bulgaria became involved in three consecutive conflicts\u2014two ', Balkan Wars',  and ', World War I', . After a disastrous defeat in the ', Second Balkan War', , Bulgaria again found itself fighting on the losing side as a result of its alliance with the ', Central Powers',  in World War I. Despite fielding more than a quarter of its population in a 1,200,000-strong army', [67]', [68]',  and achieving several decisive victories, at ', Doiran',  and ', Dobrich', , the country capitulated in 1918. The war resulted in significant territorial losses, and a total of 87,500 soldiers killed.', [69]',  More than 253,000 refugees ', immigrated',  to Bulgaria from 1912 to 1929 due to the effects of these wars,', [70]',  placing additional strain on the already ruined national economy.', [71]', 
', The political unrest resulting from these losses led to the establishment of a royal ', authoritarian dictatorship',  by Tsar ', Boris III',  (1918\u20131943). Bulgaria entered World War II in 1941 as a member of ', the Axis',  but declined to participate in ', Operation Barbarossa',  and ', saved its Jewish population',  from deportation to ', concentration camps', .', [72]',  The sudden death of Boris III in the summer of 1943 pushed the country into political turmoil as the war turned against Germany and the communist guerrilla movement gained momentum. The government of ', Bogdan Filov',  subsequently failed to achieve peace with the Allies. Bulgaria did not comply with Soviet demands to expel German forces from its territory, resulting in a declaration of war and an invasion by the USSR in September 1944.', [73]',  The communist-dominated ', Fatherland Front',  took power, ended participation in the Axis and joined the Allied side until the war ended.', [74]',

These policies (combined with the end of communist rule in 1989) resulted in the emigration of some 300,000 ethnic Turks to Turkey.', [85]', [86]', 
', Under the influence of the ', collapsing of the Eastern Bloc', , on 10 November 1989 the Communist Party gave up its political monopoly, Zhivkov resigned, and Bulgaria embarked on a transition to a parliamentary democracy.', [87]',  The first free elections in June 1990 were won by the ', Bulgarian Socialist Party',  (BSP, the freshly renamed Communist Party).', [88]',  A ', new constitution',  that provided for a relatively weak elected president and for a prime minister accountable to the legislature was adopted in July 1991. The new system initially failed to improve living standards or create economic growth\u2014the average quality of life and economic performance remained lower than under communism well into the early 2000s.', [89]',  A 1997 reform package restored economic growth, but living standards continued to suffer.', [90]',  After 2001 economic, political and geopolitical conditions improved greatly,', [91]',  and Bulgaria achieved high Human Development status.', [92]',  It became a member of ', NATO',  in 2004', [93]',  and participated in the ', War in Afghanistan', .

It is bordered by ', Romania',  to the north, ', Serbia',  and ', Macedonia',  to the west, ', Greece',  and ', Turkey',  to the south, and the ', Black Sea', u" to the east. With a territory of 110,994 square kilometres (42,855 sq mi), Bulgaria is Europe's ", 16th-largest country', .', 
', Organised ', prehistoric',  cultures began developing on current Bulgarian lands during the ', Neolithic',  period. Its ancient history saw the presence of the ', Thracians', , ', Greeks',  and ', Romans', . The emergence of a unified Bulgarian state dates back to the establishment of the ', First Bulgarian Empire',  in 681 AD, which dominated most of the ', Balkans',  and functioned as a cultural hub for ', Slavs',  during the ', Middle Ages', . With the downfall of the ', Second Bulgarian Empire',  in 1396, its territories came under ', Ottoman',  rule for nearly five centuries. The ', Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u201378',  led to the formation of the Third Bulgarian State. The following years saw several conflicts with its neighbours, which prompted Bulgaria to align with Germany in both world wars. In 1946 it became a one-party ', socialist state',  as part of the Soviet-led ', Eastern Bloc', . In ', December 1989',  the ruling ', Communist Party',  allowed ', multi-party', u" elections, which subsequently led to Bulgaria's transition into a ", democracy',  and a market-based economy.', 
', u"Bulgaria's population of 7.4 million people is predominantly urbanised and mainly concentrated in the administrative centres of its ", 28 provinces', . Most commercial and cultural activities are centred on the capital and largest city, ', Sofia', . The strongest sectors of the economy are heavy industry, power engineering, and agriculture, all of which rely on local natural resources.', 
', u"The country's current political structure dates to the adoption of a democratic constitution in 1991. Bulgaria is a ", unitary',  ', parliamentary republic',  with a high degree of political, administrative, and economic centralisation. It is a member of the ', European Union', , ', NATO', , and the ', Council of Europe', ; a founding state of the ', Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe',  (OSCE); and has taken a seat at the ', UN Security Council',  three times.',

', Human activity in the lands of modern Bulgaria can be traced back to the ', Paleolithic', . Animal bones incised with man-made markings from ', Kozarnika',  cave are assumed to be the earliest examples of ', symbolic behaviour',  in humans.', [6]',  Organised prehistoric societies in Bulgarian lands include the ', Neolithic',  ', Hamangia culture', ,', [7]',  ', Vin\u010da culture', [8]',  and the ', eneolithic',  ', Varna culture',  (fifth millennium BC). The latter is credited with inventing ', gold',  working and exploitation.', [9]', [10]',  Some of these first gold smelters produced the coins, weapons and jewellery of the ', Varna Necropolis treasure', , the oldest in the world with an approximate age of over 6,000 years.', [11]',  This site also offers insights for understanding the social hierarchy of the earliest European societies.', [12]', [13]', 
', Thracians', , one of the three primary ancestral groups of modern Bulgarians,', [14]',  began appearing in the region during the ', Iron Age', .', [15]',  In the late 6th century BC, the ', Persians',  conquered most of present-day Bulgaria.', [16]', [17]', [18]',  and kept it until ', 479 BC', .', [18]',  With influence from the Persians,', [19]',  the bulk of the Thracian tribes were united in the ', Odrysian kingdom',  in the 470s BC by king ', Teres', ,', [20]', [21]', [22]',  but were later subjugated by ', Alexander the Great',  and by the ', Romans',  in 46 AD. After the division of the ', Roman Empire',  in the 5th century the area fell under ', Byzantine',  control. By this time, ', Christianity',  had already spread in the region. A small ', Gothic',  community in ', Nicopolis ad Istrum',  produced the first ', Germanic language',  book in the 4th century, the ', Wulfila Bible', .', [23]', [24]',  The ', first Christian monastery',  in Europe was established around the same time by ', Saint Athanasius',  in central Bulgaria.', [25]',  From the 6th century the easternmost ', South Slavs',  gradually settled in the region, assimilating the Hellenised or Romanised Thracians.', [26]', [27]',

', Succeeding rulers strengthened the Bulgarian state throughout the 8th and 9th centuries. ', Krum', u" doubled the country's territory, killed Byzantine emperor ", Nicephorus I',  in the ', Battle of Pliska', ,', [31]',  and introduced the first written code of law. Paganism was abolished in favour of ', Eastern Orthodox Christianity',  under ', Boris I',  in 864. This ', conversion',  was followed by a Byzantine recognition of the ', Bulgarian church', [32]',  and the adoption of the ', Cyrillic alphabet',  developed at ', Preslav', [33]',  which strengthened central authority and helped fuse the Slavs and Bulgars into a unified people.', [34]', [35]',  A subsequent cultural golden age began during the 34-year rule of ', Simeon the Great', , who also achieved the largest territorial expansion of the state.', [36]', 
', Wars with ', Magyars',  and ', Pechenegs',  and the spread of the ', Bogomil heresy', u" weakened Bulgaria after Simeon's death.", [37]', [38]',  Consecutive ', u"Rus'",  and Byzantine invasions resulted in the seizure of the capital ', Preslav',  by the Byzantine army in 971.', [39]',  Under ', Samuil', , Bulgaria briefly recovered from these attacks,', [40]',  but this rise ended when Byzantine emperor ', Basil II',  defeated the Bulgarian army at ', Klyuch',  in 1014.

', Tarnovo was captured by the Ottomans after a three-month siege in 1393. After the ', Battle of Nicopolis',  in 1396 brought about the fall of the Vidin Tsardom, the Ottomans conquered all Bulgarian lands south of the Danube. The nobility was eliminated and the peasantry was ', enserfed',  to Ottoman masters,', [49]',  with much of the educated clergy fleeing to other countries.', [50]',  Under the Ottoman system, Christians were considered an ', inferior class',  of people. Thus, Bulgarians, like other Christians, were subjected to heavy taxes and a small portion of the Bulgarian populace experienced partial or complete ', Islamisation', ,', [51]',  and their culture was suppressed.', [50]',  Ottoman authorities established the Rum ', Millet', , a religious administrative community which governed all Orthodox Christians regardless of their ethnicity.', [52]',  Most of the local population gradually lost its distinct national consciousness, identifying as Christians.', [53]', [54]',  However, the clergy remaining in some isolated monasteries kept it alive, and that helped it to survive as in some rural, remote areas,', [55]',  as well as in the militant ', Catholic community',  in the northwestern part of the country.', [56]',

Up to 30,000 Bulgarians were killed as Ottoman authorities put down the rebellion. The massacres prompted the ', Great Powers',  to take action.', [58]',  They convened the ', Constantinople Conference',  in 1876, but their decisions were rejected by the Ottomans.

', 
', The ', Treaty of San Stefano',  was signed on 3 March 1878 by Russia and the Ottoman Empire, and included a provision to set up an autonomous Bulgarian principality roughly on the territories of the Second Bulgarian Empire.', [60]', [61]',  The other ', Great Powers',  immediately rejected the treaty out of fear that such a large country in the Balkans might threaten their interests.
