                  ', Job done: The Trinity Forum partners, Mumbai International Airport Limited/GVK, THe Moodie Davitt Report, ACI World and ACI Asia-Pacific celebrate a momentous event', 
', INDIA.',  The Trinity Forum 2016 closed on a powerful note in Mumbai yesterday as speaker after speaker spoke candidly about the dual threats and opportunities offered by e-commerce.', 
', We\u2019ll bring you a full report on this week\u2019s event next week and an extensive picture gallery of surely one of the most vibrant, engaging and focused Trinity Forums in its 13-year history.', 
', Day two\u2019s speakers provided an engaging range of perspectives that, combined, helped deliver a more complete industry picture \u2013 and also sparked a spirited debate. In particular, the discussions consolidated the themes highlighted on day one by providing probably the most detailed examination of passenger profiling and behaviour ever seen at a travel retail event.', 
', The Moodie Davitt Report President ', Dermot Davitt',  launched the day by thanking Mumbai International Airport Limited and GVK for an extraordinary Bollywood-themed Gala Dinner. ', Stefano Baronci, ', Director, Economics,',  ', ACI World, then led the ACI World session: \u2018Evaluating how passenger satisfaction drives airport non-aeronautical revenues.\u2019', 
', In a Trinity Forum exclusive launch, Baronci presented ACI\u2019s latest profiling initiative, ACI Passenger Personas. The series of six personas highlighted the increasing depth and sophistication of passenger profiling methodology \u2013 and opened up the intriguing opportunity for airports and retailers to share a sharper picture of the key target travellers.', 
', Baronci\u2019s startling suggestion that an increase (1%) in customer satisfaction can significantly out-perform corresponding expansion in retail space or rise in traffic was a pivotal finding that sparked much interest (and a surge of online questions via the Forum\u2019s live audience question format).', 
', Guy Stephenson', , Chief Commercial Officer, London Gatwick Airport, consolidated the passenger profiling theme as he emphasised the need for an ever-closer focus on the consumer. But he said that further breakdown of the passenger was needed, noting, \u201cIt\u2019s not just about who the passenger is, it\u2019s also about the time of day\u201d.', 
', Equally articulate perspectives from ', Saurabh Kumar', , Chief Executive Officer, Hyderabad Duty Free Retail Limited, GMR Group, and ', Chris Rayner', , Chief Executive Officer, SSP Asia-Pacific further developed the discussion. Rayner emphasised that a stronger F&B offer does not cannibalise retail spend \u2013 quite the opposite. Kumar further expanded the debate on ACI\u2019s fascinating \u20181% solution\u2019 by citing Hyderabad\u2019s experience of a +6% rise in ASQ score that supported growth in non-aeronautical revenue of twice that rate.', 
', The subsequent debate on the challenges and opportunities of social & digital media and e-commerce led ', Eugene Barry', , Executive Vice President, Commercial & Communications, Dubai Airports, to call for the industry to \u201cstand up, stand out\u201d and create compelling reasons to shop. He expressed frustration at the industry\u2019s weakness in focusing on the whole customer journey. Profiling is vital and \u201cairports need complete integration of approach across the whole airport journey\u2026 a cohesive approach\u201d.', 
', Amit Butani, Peter Zottle and Eugene Barry with moderator Dermot Davitt', 
', Amit Butani', , Founder, DutyFree.Buzz, re-ignited the previous day\u2019s intense analysis of pricing and unveiled his new online price comparison site (DutyFree.Buzz). He also previewed a deeply ambitious new initiative called Proxy, which seeks to encourage travellers not using their allowances to purchase on behalf of others. Both aspects of his presentation generated heavy audience feedback.', 
', Peter Zottl', , Vice President Travel Retail, Swarovski, emphasised the power of embracing digital \u2013 and concluded his highly entertaining session with the point that pricing is a card that can be trumped by skilled customer service. He underlined how Swarovski had reinvented itself time and again over its history and was doing exactly the same in the digital era.', 
', In a superb addressing of the question \u2018How should today\u2019s airports view the travelling consumer?\u2019, ', Glyn Williams', , General Manager, Retail, Sydney Airport, shared the airport\u2019s stunning new passenger experience, built on reaching the customer \u201cfrom roadway to runway\u2019. Additionally, Sydney\u2019s \u2018straight path\u2019 walk-through strategy was a major talking point.', 
', Sydney Airport\u2019s Glyn Williams delivered a superb presentation', 
', The final Trinity Panel promised a straight-talking look at the future and arguably The Trinity Forum\u2019 s standout presentation by ', Kai Schmidhuber ', (below), Executive Vice President Multi-Channel, Fraport, stunned the audience with the depth, foresight and quality of execution of the digitally-powered experience at Fraport.',

                  ', Job done: The Trinity Forum partners, Mumbai International Airport Limited/GVK, THe Moodie Davitt Report, ACI World and ACI Asia-Pacific celebrate a momentous event', 
', INDIA.',  The Trinity Forum 2016 closed on a powerful note in Mumbai yesterday as speaker after speaker spoke candidly about the dual threats and opportunities offered by e-commerce.', 
', We\u2019ll bring you a full report on this week\u2019s event next week and an extensive picture gallery of surely one of the most vibrant, engaging and focused Trinity Forums in its 13-year history.', 
', Day two\u2019s speakers provided an engaging range of perspectives that, combined, helped deliver a more complete industry picture \u2013 and also sparked a spirited debate. In particular, the discussions consolidated the themes highlighted on day one by providing probably the most detailed examination of passenger profiling and behaviour ever seen at a travel retail event.', 
', The Moodie Davitt Report President ', Dermot Davitt',  launched the day by thanking Mumbai International Airport Limited and GVK for an extraordinary Bollywood-themed Gala Dinner. ', Stefano Baronci, ', Director, Economics,',  ', ACI World, then led the ACI World session: \u2018Evaluating how passenger satisfaction drives airport non-aeronautical revenues.\u2019', 
', In a Trinity Forum exclusive launch, Baronci presented ACI\u2019s latest profiling initiative, ACI Passenger Personas. The series of six personas highlighted the increasing depth and sophistication of passenger profiling methodology \u2013 and opened up the intriguing opportunity for airports and retailers to share a sharper picture of the key target travellers.', 
', Baronci\u2019s startling suggestion that an increase (1%) in customer satisfaction can significantly out-perform corresponding expansion in retail space or rise in traffic was a pivotal finding that sparked much interest (and a surge of online questions via the Forum\u2019s live audience question format).', 
', Guy Stephenson', , Chief Commercial Officer, London Gatwick Airport, consolidated the passenger profiling theme as he emphasised the need for an ever-closer focus on the consumer. But he said that further breakdown of the passenger was needed, noting, \u201cIt\u2019s not just about who the passenger is, it\u2019s also about the time of day\u201d.', 
', Equally articulate perspectives from ', Saurabh Kumar', , Chief Executive Officer, Hyderabad Duty Free Retail Limited, GMR Group, and ', Chris Rayner', , Chief Executive Officer, SSP Asia-Pacific further developed the discussion. Rayner emphasised that a stronger F&B offer does not cannibalise retail spend \u2013 quite the opposite. Kumar further expanded the debate on ACI\u2019s fascinating \u20181% solution\u2019 by citing Hyderabad\u2019s experience of a +6% rise in ASQ score that supported growth in non-aeronautical revenue of twice that rate.', 
', The subsequent debate on the challenges and opportunities of social & digital media and e-commerce led ', Eugene Barry', , Executive Vice President, Commercial & Communications, Dubai Airports, to call for the industry to \u201cstand up, stand out\u201d and create compelling reasons to shop. He expressed frustration at the industry\u2019s weakness in focusing on the whole customer journey. Profiling is vital and \u201cairports need complete integration of approach across the whole airport journey\u2026 a cohesive approach\u201d.', 
', Amit Butani, Peter Zottle and Eugene Barry with moderator Dermot Davitt', 
', Amit Butani', , Founder, DutyFree.Buzz, re-ignited the previous day\u2019s intense analysis of pricing and unveiled his new online price comparison site (DutyFree.Buzz). He also previewed a deeply ambitious new initiative called Proxy, which seeks to encourage travellers not using their allowances to purchase on behalf of others. Both aspects of his presentation generated heavy audience feedback.', 
', Peter Zottl', , Vice President Travel Retail, Swarovski, emphasised the power of embracing digital \u2013 and concluded his highly entertaining session with the point that pricing is a card that can be trumped by skilled customer service. He underlined how Swarovski had reinvented itself time and again over its history and was doing exactly the same in the digital era.', 
', In a superb addressing of the question \u2018How should today\u2019s airports view the travelling consumer?\u2019, ', Glyn Williams', , General Manager, Retail, Sydney Airport, shared the airport\u2019s stunning new passenger experience, built on reaching the customer \u201cfrom roadway to runway\u2019. Additionally, Sydney\u2019s \u2018straight path\u2019 walk-through strategy was a major talking point.', 
', Sydney Airport\u2019s Glyn Williams delivered a superb presentation', 
', The final Trinity Panel promised a straight-talking look at the future and arguably The Trinity Forum\u2019 s standout presentation by ', Kai Schmidhuber ', (below), Executive Vice President Multi-Channel, Fraport, stunned the audience with the depth, foresight and quality of execution of the digitally-powered experience at Fraport.', 
', \u201cMobile devices are changing the way we all live,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need an eco-system that combines your online and off-line worlds \u2013 we need new channels to reach them and it\u2019s going to be a very digital journey.\u201d', 
', He noted that \u201cattention is the new currency\u201d \u2013 and an ominous warning that \u201csome of you have already missed the plane\u201d. But the big talking point of his presentation was a trial three-way partnership between Lufthansa, Frankfurt Airport and Gebr Heinemann, in which passengers can browse and shop in the air from the entire ground-shop range and collect on delivery. Moderator Martin Moodie saluted the initiative as a long-awaited \u201cgame changer\u201d and questioned Schmidhuber closely on how such a partnership came about,', 
', In another outstanding presentation, ', Michael Guenoun', , Managing Director Travel Retail Asia, Cartier, followed that with a warning on the impact of the Chinese \u2018daigou\u2019 shopping phenomenon and said the industry must focus on the experiential, not just the transactional. Travel retail remained as relevant as ever, he said, it just needed to be approached and executed the right way for a luxury brand such as Cartier.', 
', Michael Guenoun: \u201cMake the journey less of a process and more of an experience\u201d', 
', Guenoun said: \u201cTravel retail is a fantastic route for brands to communicate with the customer\u201d, adding later, \u201cMake the journey less of a process and more of an experience.\u201d', 
', The irrepressible, entertaining and informative ', Paul Topping, ', Director & Board Member, Flemingo International, then emphasised that the fundamentals of knowing your customer remain paramount.', 
', The irrepressible Paul Topping in unstoppable form', 
', Completing a quality quartet, long-time travel retail expert and former L\u2019Oréal Group executive ', Stefan Dembinski ', expressed his personal views on',  ', the need for evolution. He brought the debate full circle from yesterday\u2019s \u2018climate change\u2019 theme with his call for the industry to \u201cadopt and adapt\u201d.', 
', All presentations will be made available to paying delegates in coming days while October\u2019s issue of The Moodie Davitt Report Print Edition will assess the key take-outs from this seminal event.', 
', In coming days we will unveiling exciting news relating to The Trinity Forum 2017.',
