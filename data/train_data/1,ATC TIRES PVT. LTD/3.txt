Is it a turnover in excess  of  US$500 million with a presence in over 120 countries and service points across 6 continents? Or do 1200 single-minded employees, more than 2200 dealers striving for excellence and an expertise spanning 60 years go in the making of a giant? Or does a giant evolve when the vision is vivid, when values are unshakeable and there is a deep commitment that runs across all levels? If these are the prerequisites to be a giant, then ATG surely is. ',

Is it a turnover in excess  of  US$500 million with a presence in over 120 countries and service points across 6 continents? Or do 1200 single-minded employees, more than 2200 dealers striving for excellence and an expertise spanning 60 years go in the making of a giant? Or does a giant evolve when the vision is vivid, when values are unshakeable and there is a deep commitment that runs across all levels? If these are the prerequisites to be a giant, then ATG surely is. ',
