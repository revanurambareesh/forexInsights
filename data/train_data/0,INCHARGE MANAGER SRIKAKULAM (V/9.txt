		",  ',  ',  ',  ', Managers and Supervisors',  ', There are generally several layers of management in a large corporation, though higher management ranks go by titles such as "general manager" or "director." At the operational or day-to-day level, managers are typically responsible for output and performance of their units and they tend to take an external or global view of their operations. Managers need supervisors, though, to handle internal production or work issues within their units. Supervisors, for example, implement manager decisions through the work of employees they directly oversee.',  ', Manager Job Descriptions',  ', Regardless of a manager's specific industry, common core competencies are typically listed on manager job descriptions. A manager's job description will require an ability to plan, direct and coordinate the operations of a business, division, department or operating unit. Planning and directing activities are major components in manager job descriptions, as are allocating and delegating work duties to staff such as supervisors. Look for a manager's job description to contain key phrases such as "problem analysis" and "problem solving."',  ', Supervisor Job Descriptions',  ', u"True supervisors are much more process- and activity-oriented than the managers for whom they work. Job descriptions for supervisors generally require the ability to coordinate the activities of workers assigned to the supervisor and then report those activities back to managers. A big part of a supervisor's job description deals with executing directives and plans handed over by managers of the supervisor's assigned operating unit. Supervisor job descriptions also frequently mention handling or resolving daily issues, concerns and grievances of assigned workers.",  ', Education and Pay Levels',  ', Education-wise, manager job descriptions frequently list bachelor or higher-level degrees or significant experience. Most job descriptions for actual front-line supervisors may emphasize years of experience over education, though employers are increasingly requiring two-year or even four-year college degrees. Because managers frequently make significant decisions on what their units do, their pay tends to be higher than that of subordinate supervisors. For example, a logistics manager at clothing retailer Old Navy makes about $49,000 annually while a supervisor makes $32,000, according to the CareerBliss website.',  ',  ',  ',  ', u"

		",  ',  ',  ',  ', Managers and Supervisors',  ', There are generally several layers of management in a large corporation, though higher management ranks go by titles such as "general manager" or "director." At the operational or day-to-day level, managers are typically responsible for output and performance of their units and they tend to take an external or global view of their operations. Managers need supervisors, though, to handle internal production or work issues within their units. Supervisors, for example, implement manager decisions through the work of employees they directly oversee.',  ', Manager Job Descriptions',  ', Regardless of a manager's specific industry, common core competencies are typically listed on manager job descriptions. A manager's job description will require an ability to plan, direct and coordinate the operations of a business, division, department or operating unit. Planning and directing activities are major components in manager job descriptions, as are allocating and delegating work duties to staff such as supervisors. Look for a manager's job description to contain key phrases such as "problem analysis" and "problem solving."',  ', Supervisor Job Descriptions',  ', u"True supervisors are much more process- and activity-oriented than the managers for whom they work. Job descriptions for supervisors generally require the ability to coordinate the activities of workers assigned to the supervisor and then report those activities back to managers. A big part of a supervisor's job description deals with executing directives and plans handed over by managers of the supervisor's assigned operating unit. Supervisor job descriptions also frequently mention handling or resolving daily issues, concerns and grievances of assigned workers.",  ', Education and Pay Levels',  ', Education-wise, manager job descriptions frequently list bachelor or higher-level degrees or significant experience. Most job descriptions for actual front-line supervisors may emphasize years of experience over education, though employers are increasingly requiring two-year or even four-year college degrees. Because managers frequently make significant decisions on what their units do, their pay tends to be higher than that of subordinate supervisors. For example, a logistics manager at clothing retailer Old Navy makes about $49,000 annually while a supervisor makes $32,000, according to the CareerBliss website.',  ',  ',  ',  ', u"
