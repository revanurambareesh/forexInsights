Temple of ', Tiruchuzhi', , ', Tamil Nad, 
', 
', 
', Ramana Maharshi was born Venkataraman Iyer on 30 December 1879 in the village ', Tiruchuzhi',  near ', Aruppukkottai', , ', Madurai',  in Tamil Nadu, ', South India', . Venkataraman was the second of four children in an orthodox ', Hind,  ', Brahmin',  family. His father was Sundaram ', Iyer', u" (1848\u20131890), from the lineage of Parashara, and his mother was Azhagammal (1864-1922). He had two brothers Nagaswami (1877\u20131900) and Nagasundaram (1886\u20131953), along with a younger sister Alamelu (1887-1953). Venkataraman's father was a court ", pleader', .', [11]', 
', u"Both a paternal uncle of his father and his father's brother had become sannyasins.", [12]', u" Venkataraman's family belonged to the ", Smarta',  denomination, and regular worship of Siva, Vishnu, Ganesa, Surya and Sakti took place in their home.', [13]', [14]', 
', When Venkataraman was seven he had his ', upanayana', , the traditional initiation of the three upper ', varnas',  into Brahmanical learning and the knowledge of Self. He had a very good memory, being able to recall information after hearing it once, an ability he used to memorise Tamil poems.', [15]', 
', Narasimha notes that Venkataraman used to sleep very deeply, not waking up from loud sounds nor even when his body was beaten by others.', [16]', [17]',  When he was about twelve years old, he may have experienced deep meditative states spontaneously. In ', Sri Ramana Vijayam', , the Tamil biography that first appeared in the 1920s, narrates about a period a few years before the death-experience in Madurai:', 
', 
', Some incomplete practice from a past birth was clinging to me. I would be putting attention solely within, forgetting the body. Sometimes I would be sitting in one place, but when I regained normal consciousness and got up, I would notice that I was lying down in a different narrow space [to the one where I had first sat down].', [note 3]', 
', 
', When he was about eleven his father sent him to live with his paternal uncle Subbaiyar in ', Dindigul',  as he wanted his sons to be educated in the English language so that they would be eligible to enter ', government service', . Only ', Tamil',  was taught at the village school in Tiruchuzhi,', [15]',  which he attended for three years.', [18]',  In 1891, when his uncle was transferred to ', Madurai', , Venkataraman and his elder brother Nagaswami moved with him. In Dindigul, Venkataraman attended a Hindu School where English was taught,', [15]',  and stayed there for a year.', [18]', 
', Sundaram Iyer, his father died suddenly on 18 February 1892.', [19]', u" After his father's death, the family split up; Venkataraman and Nagaswami stayed with Subbaiyar in Madurai.", [12]',

Venkataraman as a young man.', 
', 
', 
', See also: ', Nayanars', , ', Shaiva Siddhanta', , and ', History of Shaivism', 
', u"Venkataraman first attended Scott's Middle School and then the American Mission High School where he became acquainted with Christianity.", [20]', 
', In November 1895 Venkataraman realized that Arunachala, the sacred mountain, was a real place.', [21]',  He had known of its existence from an early age on, and was overwhelmed by the realisation that it really existed.', [21]',  During this time he also read ', Sekkizhar', u"'s ", Periyapuranam', , a book that describes the lives of the 63 ', Nayanars', , which "made a great impression" on him,', [22]', [web 3]',  and revealed to him that "Divine Union" is possible.', [21]',  According to Osborne, a new current of awareness started to awaken during his visits to the Meenakshi Temple at Madura, "a state of blissful consciousness transcending both the physical and mental plane and yet compatible with full use of the physical and mental faculties."', [23]', 
', According to Narasimha, in July 1896,', [22]', [note 4]',  at age 16, a sudden fear of death befell him. He was struck by "a flash of excitement" or "heat," like some ', avesam', , a "current" or "force" that seemed to possess him,', [web 1]',  and he initiated a process of ', self-enquiry',  asking himself what it is that dies. He concluded that the body dies, but that this "current" or "force" remains alive, and recognised this "current" or "force" as his ', Self', , which he later identified with "the personal God, or ', Iswara', ."', [web 1]', 
', In one of his rare written comments on this process Ramana Maharshi wrote, "Enquiring within ', Who is the seer?',  I saw the seer disappear leaving That alone which stands forever. No thought arose to say ', I saw', . How then could the thought arise to say ', I did not see', ".', [web 4]', 
', Later in life, he called his death experience ', akrama mukti', , "', sudden liberation', ", as opposed to the ', krama mukti', , "gradual liberation" as in the Vedanta path of ', jnana yoga', .', [web 3]', [note 5]',  It resulted in a state of mind which he later described as "the state of mind of Iswara or the jnani:"', [web 1]', 
', 
', After reading the language of the sacred books, I see it may be termed suddha manas [pure mind], akhandakara vritti [unbroken experience], prajna [true knowledge] etc.; that is, the state of mind of Iswara or the jnani."', [web 1]', 
', 
', After this event, he lost interest in school studies, friends, and relations. He was absent-minded at school, "imagining and expecting God would suddenly drop down from Heaven before me."', [web 3]',  Avoiding company, he preferred to sit alone, absorbed in concentration on this current or force,', [25]',  and went daily to the Meenakshi Temple, ecstatically devoted to the images of the 63 Nayanars and of ', Nataraja', , wanting "the same grace as was shown to those saints,"', [web 3]',  praying that he "should have the same bhakti that they had"', [web 3]',  and "[weeping] that God should give me the same grace He gave to those saints".', [web 3]', [11]', 
', Knowing his family would not permit him to become a sanyassin and leave home, Venkataraman slipped away, telling his brother he needed to attend a special class at school.', [26]',  Venkataraman boarded a train on 1 September 1896 and traveled to Tiruvannamalai where he remained for the rest of his life.', [', citation needed', ]',

', 
', 
', Ramana Maharshi was born Venkataraman Iyer on 30 December 1879 in the village ', Tiruchuzhi',  near ', Aruppukkottai', , ', Madurai',  in Tamil Nadu, ', South India', . Venkataraman was the second of four children in an orthodox ', Hind,  ', Brahmin',  family. His father was Sundaram ', Iyer', u" (1848\u20131890), from the lineage of Parashara, and his mother was Azhagammal (1864-1922). He had two brothers Nagaswami (1877\u20131900) and Nagasundaram (1886\u20131953), along with a younger sister Alamelu (1887-1953). Venkataraman's father was a court ", pleader', .', [11]', 
', u"Both a paternal uncle of his father and his father's brother had become sannyasins.", [12]', u" Venkataraman's family belonged to the ", Smarta',  denomination, and regular worship of Siva, Vishnu, Ganesa, Surya and Sakti took place in their home.', [13]', [14]', 
', When Venkataraman was seven he had his ', upanayana', , the traditional initiation of the three upper ', varnas',  into Brahmanical learning and the knowledge of Self. He had a very good memory, being able to recall information after hearing it once, an ability he used to memorise Tamil poems.', [15]', 
', Narasimha notes that Venkataraman used to sleep very deeply, not waking up from loud sounds nor even when his body was beaten by others.', [16]', [17]',  When he was about twelve years old, he may have experienced deep meditative states spontaneously. In ', Sri Ramana Vijayam', , the Tamil biography that first appeared in the 1920s, narrates about a period a few years before the death-experience in Madurai:', 
', 
', Some incomplete practice from a past birth was clinging to me. I would be putting attention solely within, forgetting the body. Sometimes I would be sitting in one place, but when I regained normal consciousness and got up, I would notice that I was lying down in a different narrow space [to the one where I had first sat down].', [note 3]', 
', 
', When he was about eleven his father sent him to live with his paternal uncle Subbaiyar in ', Dindigul',  as he wanted his sons to be educated in the English language so that they would be eligible to enter ', government service', . Only ', Tamil',  was taught at the village school in Tiruchuzhi,', [15]',  which he attended for three years.', [18]',  In 1891, when his uncle was transferred to ', Madurai', , Venkataraman and his elder brother Nagaswami moved with him. In Dindigul, Venkataraman attended a Hindu School where English was taught,', [15]',  and stayed there for a year.', [18]', 
', Sundaram Iyer, his father died suddenly on 18 February 1892.', [19]', u" After his father's death, the family split up; Venkataraman and Nagaswami stayed with Subbaiyar in Madurai.", [12]',

', u"Venkataraman first attended Scott's Middle School and then the American Mission High School where he became acquainted with Christianity.", [20]', 
', In November 1895 Venkataraman realized that Arunachala, the sacred mountain, was a real place.', [21]',  He had known of its existence from an early age on, and was overwhelmed by the realisation that it really existed.', [21]',  During this time he also read ', Sekkizhar', u"'s ", Periyapuranam', , a book that describes the lives of the 63 ', Nayanars', , which "made a great impression" on him,', [22]', [web 3]',  and revealed to him that "Divine Union" is possible.', [21]',  According to Osborne, a new current of awareness started to awaken during his visits to the Meenakshi Temple at Madura, "a state of blissful consciousness transcending both the physical and mental plane and yet compatible with full use of the physical and mental faculties."', [23]', 
', According to Narasimha, in July 1896,', [22]', [note 4]',  at age 16, a sudden fear of death befell him. He was struck by "a flash of excitement" or "heat," like some ', avesam', , a "current" or "force" that seemed to possess him,', [web 1]',  and he initiated a process of ', self-enquiry',  asking himself what it is that dies. He concluded that the body dies, but that this "current" or "force" remains alive, and recognised this "current" or "force" as his ', Self', , which he later identified with "the personal God, or ', Iswara', ."', [web 1]', 
', In one of his rare written comments on this process Ramana Maharshi wrote, "Enquiring within ', Who is the seer?',  I saw the seer disappear leaving That alone which stands forever. No thought arose to say ', I saw', . How then could the thought arise to say ', I did not see', ".', [web 4]', 
', Later in life, he called his death experience ', akrama mukti', , "', sudden liberation', ", as opposed to the ', krama mukti', , "gradual liberation" as in the Vedanta path of ', jnana yoga', .', [web 3]', [note 5]',  It resulted in a state of mind which he later described as "the state of mind of Iswara or the jnani:"', [web 1]', 
', 
', After reading the language of the sacred books, I see it may be termed suddha manas [pure mind], akhandakara vritti [unbroken experience], prajna [true knowledge] etc.; that is, the state of mind of Iswara or the jnani."', [web 1]', 
', 
', After this event, he lost interest in school studies, friends, and relations. He was absent-minded at school, "imagining and expecting God would suddenly drop down from Heaven before me."', [web 3]',  Avoiding company, he preferred to sit alone, absorbed in concentration on this current or force,', [25]',  and went daily to the Meenakshi Temple, ecstatically devoted to the images of the 63 Nayanars and of ', Nataraja', , wanting "the same grace as was shown to those saints,"', [web 3]',  praying that he "should have the same bhakti that they had"', [web 3]',  and "[weeping] that God should give me the same grace He gave to those saints".', [web 3]', [11]', 
', Knowing his family would not permit him to become a sanyassin and leave home, Venkataraman slipped away, telling his brother he needed to attend a special class at school.', [26]',  Venkataraman boarded a train on 1 September 1896 and traveled to Tiruvannamalai where he remained for the rest of his life.', [', citation needed', ]',

There, he spent days absorbed in such deep ', sam\u0101dhi',  that he was unaware of the bites of vermin and pests. ', Seshadri Swamigal', , a local saint, discovered him in the underground vault and tried to protect him.', [26]',  After about six weeks in the Patala-lingam, he was carried out and cleaned up. For the next two months he stayed in the Subramanya Shrine, so unaware of his body and surroundings that food had to be placed in his mouth or he would have starved.', 
', Gurumurtam temple (1897\u20131898)', [', edit', ]', 
', In February 1897, six months after his arrival at Tiruvannamalai, Ramana moved to Gurumurtam, a temple about a mile from Tiruvannamalai.', [28]',  Shortly after his arrival a sadhu named Palaniswami went to see him.', [29]', u" Palaniswami's first ", darshan',  left him filled with peace and bliss, and from that time on he served Ramana as his permanent attendant. Besides physical protection, Palaniswami would also beg for alms, cook and prepare meals for himself and Ramana, and care for him as needed.', [30]',  In May 1898 Ramana moved to a mango orchard next to Gurumurtam.', [31]', 
', Osborne wrote that during this time Ramana completely neglected his body.', [30]',  He also ignored the ants which bit him incessantly.', [28]', u" Gradually, despite Ramana's desire for privacy, he attracted attention from visitors who admired his silence and austerities, bringing offerings and singing praises. Eventually a bamboo fence was built to protect him.", [28]', 
', While living at Gurumurtam temple his family discovered his whereabouts. First his uncle Nelliappa Iyer came and pleaded with him to return home, promising that the family would not disturb his ascetic life. Ramana sat motionless and eventually his uncle gave up.', [32]', 
', In September, 1898 Ramana moved to the Shiva-temple at Pavalakkunru, one of the eastern spurs of Arunachala. He refused to return when begged by his mother.', [33]',
