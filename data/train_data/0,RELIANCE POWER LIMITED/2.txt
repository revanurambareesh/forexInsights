', Order to Shanghai Electric', [', edit', ]', 
', Anil Dhirubhai Ambani',  placed a single order for $8.3 billion with ', Shanghai Electric Group Company',  (SEC) for buying 36 coal-fired thermal power generation units, spare parts and related services over a 10-year period. This took the total deal size between Reliance Power and the Chinese power equipment maker over the past couple of years to $10 billion, making it the largest contract between a private Indian company and a government-owned Chinese firm.', 
', While Reliance Power has also given a $2.2 billion deal to US-based ', General Electric', , the agreement signed with SEC is on a different plane. The Chinese company will supply boiler, turbine and generator packages for up to 30,000 MW capacity of coal-based power at six plants, including the 4000 MW ultra mega power project in ', Krishnapatnam', , the 3960 MW Project in Chitrangi and the 4000 MW Power Project in Tilaiya.', 
', Loans from Exim bank', [', edit', ]', 
', Reliance Power Ltd. signed an agreement with the US Export-Import Bank in 2010 for a $5 billion loan to finance power projects. The loan will finance 900 megawatts of renewable technologies such as solar and wind energy,', [5]', u" as well as up to 8000 MW of gas-based power generation technology, the Indian company said in a statement. This $5 billion agreement is in addition to the $917 million already approved by the Ex-Im Bank for Reliance Power's coal-fired power plant at Sasan in central India.", 
', u"The agreement will allow Reliance Power access products and services at competitive rates and help create manufacturing and services jobs in the US. The loan will also enable quicker access to the bank's long-term dollar loans. Reliance Power signed a pact with the US's General Electric Co. (GE) worth INR100 billion ($2.2 billion) to implement a 2400 MW power plant. The plant will be located in the southern Indian town of ", Samalkot',  and the pact was signed during the visit of President Barack Obama.', [6]', 
', Initial public offering and controversies', [', edit', ]', 
', On 15 January 2008, the company attracted $27.5 billion of bids on the first day of its ', initial public offering', u" (IPO), equivalent to 10.5 times the stock on offer, thereby, creating India's IPO record. The upper cut off price for the bid was ", Rs.',  450', [7]',  The proposed IPO was to fund the development of its six power projects across the country whose completion dates are scheduled from December 2009 to March 2014.', [8]', 
', A media report suggested that, if the company\u2019s stock price were to cross Rs. 650\u2013700, Anil Ambani would go past L. N. Mittal to become the richest Indian.', [9]',  "It is a reflection of world community in the future of India... Investors seem to be confident in the future of Indian economy," Indian Finance Minister, ', P. Chidambaram',  told the media about the IPO.', [10]', 
', The ', Securities and Exchange Board of India', , which is an organisation that regulates the activity in the ', Indian',  ', stock market', , placed some restrictions based on a complaint about the formulation of the IPO.', [11]',  The complaint also resulted in a ', public interest litigation',  being filed against the company. However, the ', Supreme Court of India',  passed a ruling that the IPO would go ahead even if any order is passed by any Indian court against the venture.', [12]', 
', Reliance Power debuted on the stock markets on 11 February 2008. However, the markets were still reeling after the ', January 2008 stock market volatility', , and concerns over speculation that the issue was overpriced sent the stock plummeting soon after its listing. At the end of the day, the stock traded at a value that was 17 per cent lower than its issue price of Rs. 450 .', [13]',  Investors who were betting on the stock reaching 1.5 or even twice its issue price lost a fortune in the process. On 25 February, in an effort to mitigate investor losses, Reliance Power decided to issue 3 bonus shares for every 5 shares held.', [14]', 
', Carbon credits', [', edit', ]', 
', u"On 2 February 2011 United Nations registered Reliance Power's Sasan Power Plant to be eligible for earning carbon credits followed by Krishnapatanm Ultra Mega Power Project and Tilaiya Ultra Mega Power Projects. United Nations issues carbon credits to companies which employs advanced technologies in reducing carbon emission . These carbon credits can then be sold to those companies that are emitting more than their statutory emission limits.",

', Order to Shanghai Electric', [', edit', ]', 
', Anil Dhirubhai Ambani',  placed a single order for $8.3 billion with ', Shanghai Electric Group Company',  (SEC) for buying 36 coal-fired thermal power generation units, spare parts and related services over a 10-year period. This took the total deal size between Reliance Power and the Chinese power equipment maker over the past couple of years to $10 billion, making it the largest contract between a private Indian company and a government-owned Chinese firm.', 
', While Reliance Power has also given a $2.2 billion deal to US-based ', General Electric', , the agreement signed with SEC is on a different plane. The Chinese company will supply boiler, turbine and generator packages for up to 30,000 MW capacity of coal-based power at six plants, including the 4000 MW ultra mega power project in ', Krishnapatnam', , the 3960 MW Project in Chitrangi and the 4000 MW Power Project in Tilaiya.', 
', Loans from Exim bank', [', edit', ]', 
', Reliance Power Ltd. signed an agreement with the US Export-Import Bank in 2010 for a $5 billion loan to finance power projects. The loan will finance 900 megawatts of renewable technologies such as solar and wind energy,', [5]', u" as well as up to 8000 MW of gas-based power generation technology, the Indian company said in a statement. This $5 billion agreement is in addition to the $917 million already approved by the Ex-Im Bank for Reliance Power's coal-fired power plant at Sasan in central India.", 
', u"The agreement will allow Reliance Power access products and services at competitive rates and help create manufacturing and services jobs in the US. The loan will also enable quicker access to the bank's long-term dollar loans. Reliance Power signed a pact with the US's General Electric Co. (GE) worth INR100 billion ($2.2 billion) to implement a 2400 MW power plant. The plant will be located in the southern Indian town of ", Samalkot',  and the pact was signed during the visit of President Barack Obama.', [6]', 
', Initial public offering and controversies', [', edit', ]', 
', On 15 January 2008, the company attracted $27.5 billion of bids on the first day of its ', initial public offering', u" (IPO), equivalent to 10.5 times the stock on offer, thereby, creating India's IPO record. The upper cut off price for the bid was ", Rs.',  450', [7]',  The proposed IPO was to fund the development of its six power projects across the country whose completion dates are scheduled from December 2009 to March 2014.', [8]', 
', A media report suggested that, if the company\u2019s stock price were to cross Rs. 650\u2013700, Anil Ambani would go past L. N. Mittal to become the richest Indian.', [9]',  "It is a reflection of world community in the future of India... Investors seem to be confident in the future of Indian economy," Indian Finance Minister, ', P. Chidambaram',  told the media about the IPO.', [10]', 
', The ', Securities and Exchange Board of India', , which is an organisation that regulates the activity in the ', Indian',  ', stock market', , placed some restrictions based on a complaint about the formulation of the IPO.', [11]',  The complaint also resulted in a ', public interest litigation',  being filed against the company. However, the ', Supreme Court of India',  passed a ruling that the IPO would go ahead even if any order is passed by any Indian court against the venture.', [12]', 
', Reliance Power debuted on the stock markets on 11 February 2008. However, the markets were still reeling after the ', January 2008 stock market volatility', , and concerns over speculation that the issue was overpriced sent the stock plummeting soon after its listing. At the end of the day, the stock traded at a value that was 17 per cent lower than its issue price of Rs. 450 .', [13]',  Investors who were betting on the stock reaching 1.5 or even twice its issue price lost a fortune in the process. On 25 February, in an effort to mitigate investor losses, Reliance Power decided to issue 3 bonus shares for every 5 shares held.', [14]', 
', Carbon credits', [', edit', ]', 
', u"On 2 February 2011 United Nations registered Reliance Power's Sasan Power Plant to be eligible for earning carbon credits followed by Krishnapatanm Ultra Mega Power Project and Tilaiya Ultra Mega Power Projects. United Nations issues carbon credits to companies which employs advanced technologies in reducing carbon emission . These carbon credits can then be sold to those companies that are emitting more than their statutory emission limits.",
