Holtec International set up a subsidiary - SMR LLC - to commercialize a 140 MWe (446 MWt) factory-built reactor concept called Holtec Inherently Safe Modular Underground Reactor (HI-SMUR). The particular design being promoted is a 160 MWe version of this, SMR-160, with two external horizontal steam generators, using fuel similar to that in larger PWRs, including MOX. The 32 full-length fuel assemblies are in a fuel cartridge, which is loaded and unloaded as a single unit from the 31-metre high pressure vessel. Holtec claims a one-week refueling outage every 42 months. It has full passive cooling in operation and after shutdown and a negative temperature coefficient so that it shuts down at high temperatures. The heat sink can be to atmosphere, using dry cooling. The whole reactor system will be installed below ground level, with used fuel storage. A 24-month construction period is envisaged for each $800 million unit ($5000/kW). Operational life claimed is 80 years.', 
Holtec expected to submit an application for design certification to NRC by the end of 2012 and hopes to have the first unit operating in 2018. The detailed design phase is from August 2012. The Shaw Group is providing engineering support for the design, and Areva is involved in the development work. The Construction Permit Application and Preliminary Safety Analysis Report are due in June 2014.', u"
In March 2012 the US DOE signed an agreement with Holtec regarding constructing a demonstration SMR-160 unit at its Savannah River site in South Carolina. NuHub, a South Carolina economic development project, is supporting Holtec's bid for DOE funding for the SMR-160, as are Exelon, Entergy, PSEG, First Energy (though see above re mPower), and SCE&G which would operate the demonstration plant.",  ',
