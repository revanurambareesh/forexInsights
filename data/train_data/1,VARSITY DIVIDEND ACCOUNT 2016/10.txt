         ', Mutual fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. The Funds may make short-term investments, without limitation, for defensive purposes, which investments may provide lower returns than other types of investments. The portion of the Young Investor Fund that invests in underlying ETF\u2019s that track the Index will be subject to certain risks which are unique to tracking the Index. By investing in ETF\u2019s, you will indirectly bear your share of any fees and expenses charged by the underlying funds, in addition to indirectly bearing the principal risks of the funds. Growth-oriented funds may under-perform when growth stocks are out of favor. Please refer to the prospectus for further details. While the funds are no-load, management and other expenses still apply.',
