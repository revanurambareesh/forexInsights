I love how the teachers are always willing to help and they truly care about who you are. Shiloh provides amazing opportunities like the fifth grade play, the three day eighth grade retreat, the Service and Leadership Team, and Global Mission Experience trips for seniors. The Service and Leadership team equips students to become leaders in their community by serving others. Every Thursday we have chapel where students are challenged to lead worship and grow in their walks with Christ. Shiloh also provides college and AP classes so students are better prepared and ahead before they get to college. The Global Mission Experience trips consist of six different destinations where seniors are sent to share the gospel and learn about different cultures. I have been incredibly blessed by coming to Shiloh. I have been academically challenged in my classes, spiritually challenged through chapel and teachers, and physically challenged through sports. Shiloh is about doing life together, serving the Lord, and equipping students to change the world.', High School Senior', Oct 13 2015', Review Your ', School', Report', When I first came to Shiloh, everyone was very accepting and kind. Because Shiloh is a small school, the students and school faculty have a community type feel. The teacher care about us and show it in asking about our lives, our families, or even our weekends. I have a solid group of friends, and because of the college courses they offer, I feel as though I am prepared for college.', High School Senior', Nov 11 2015', Report', We have many opportunities for extracurricular activities including "local mission".

I love how the teachers are always willing to help and they truly care about who you are. Shiloh provides amazing opportunities like the fifth grade play, the three day eighth grade retreat, the Service and Leadership Team, and Global Mission Experience trips for seniors. The Service and Leadership team equips students to become leaders in their community by serving others. Every Thursday we have chapel where students are challenged to lead worship and grow in their walks with Christ. Shiloh also provides college and AP classes so students are better prepared and ahead before they get to college. The Global Mission Experience trips consist of six different destinations where seniors are sent to share the gospel and learn about different cultures. I have been incredibly blessed by coming to Shiloh. I have been academically challenged in my classes, spiritually challenged through chapel and teachers, and physically challenged through sports. Shiloh is about doing life together, serving the Lord, and equipping students to change the world.","rating":5,"author":"High School Senior","created":"2015-10-13T10:31:55Z"},{"guid":"ee622c24-5adf-40fd-877f-753843c1b3d9","body":"When I first came to Shiloh, everyone was very accepting and kind.

I love how the teachers are always willing to help and they truly care about who you are. Shiloh provides amazing opportunities like the fifth grade play, the three day eighth grade retreat, the Service and Leadership Team, and Global Mission Experience trips for seniors. The Service and Leadership team equips students to become leaders in their community by serving others. Every Thursday we have chapel where students are challenged to lead worship and grow in their walks with Christ. Shiloh also provides college and AP classes so students are better prepared and ahead before they get to college. The Global Mission Experience trips consist of six different destinations where seniors are sent to share the gospel and learn about different cultures. I have been incredibly blessed by coming to Shiloh. I have been academically challenged in my classes, spiritually challenged through chapel and teachers, and physically challenged through sports. Shiloh is about doing life together, serving the Lord, and equipping students to change the world.', High School Senior', Oct 13 2015', Review Your ', School', Report', When I first came to Shiloh, everyone was very accepting and kind. Because Shiloh is a small school, the students and school faculty have a community type feel. The teacher care about us and show it in asking about our lives, our families, or even our weekends. I have a solid group of friends, and because of the college courses they offer, I feel as though I am prepared for college.', High School Senior', Nov 11 2015', Report', We have many opportunities for extracurricular activities including "local mission".

I love how the teachers are always willing to help and they truly care about who you are. Shiloh provides amazing opportunities like the fifth grade play, the three day eighth grade retreat, the Service and Leadership Team, and Global Mission Experience trips for seniors. The Service and Leadership team equips students to become leaders in their community by serving others. Every Thursday we have chapel where students are challenged to lead worship and grow in their walks with Christ. Shiloh also provides college and AP classes so students are better prepared and ahead before they get to college. The Global Mission Experience trips consist of six different destinations where seniors are sent to share the gospel and learn about different cultures. I have been incredibly blessed by coming to Shiloh. I have been academically challenged in my classes, spiritually challenged through chapel and teachers, and physically challenged through sports. Shiloh is about doing life together, serving the Lord, and equipping students to change the world.","rating":5,"author":"High School Senior","created":"2015-10-13T10:31:55Z"},{"guid":"ee622c24-5adf-40fd-877f-753843c1b3d9","body":"When I first came to Shiloh, everyone was very accepting and kind.
