', u"Oil India Limited was formed by the Burmah Oil Company Limited as its subsidiary in India 1887 to explore in the Assam Basin, India ( Corley, T A B, 1983, The History of the Burmah Oil Company, 1886-1983). Staff at the Burmah Oil Company Limited had heard from a geologist with the colonial British Indian Geological Survey, Thomas Oldham, that oil was found on the feet of elephants that were being used as beasts of burden in the vicinity of the Digboi village (Arun Metrie, pers. comm., former Burmah Oil economist, 1988). The oil on the elephants' feet was traced to the Digboi area, where a surface fold (anticline in geological parlance) had formed a broad hill. A successful technique for exploration for hydrocarbons at the time was drilling beneath seeps on anticlines (Thornton, S E, 2015, The history of Oil Exploration in the Union of Myanmar, Paper No. 10807), so Oil India drilled beneath the Digboi seeps and found a giant oil field. Several other oil fields were subsequently found by Oil India Limited in what became India's first oil production.", 
', Recoverable oil reserves .As of 2014', [update]',  the company produced 3.466 MMT of crude oil, 2625.81 MMSCM of natural gas and 46,640 tonnes of LPG.', [1]',  Most of this was produced from its traditionally rich oil and gas fields concentrated in the Northeastern part of India and contribute around 80% of total oil and gas produced in the region. The search for newer avenues has seen OIL spreading out its operations in onshore / offshore ', Orissa',  and ', Andaman', , ', Cauvery',  offshore, ', Tamil Nad, , ', Arabian Sea', , deserts of ', Rajasthan', , onshore ', Andhra Pradesh', , riverbeds of ', Brahmaputra',  and logistically difficult hilly terrains of the Indian state ', Mizoram',  and ', Arunachal Pradesh', . In ', Rajasthan', , OIL discovered gas in 1988, heavy oil / bitumen in 1991 and started production of gas in 1996. The company has accumulated over a hundred years of experience in the field of oil and gas production, since the discovery of ', Digboi',  oilfield in 1889.', [', citation needed', ]', 
', The company has over 100,000 square kilometres (39,000 sq mi) of licensed areas for oil and gas exploration. It has emerged as a consistently profitable ', International',  company', [', citation needed', ]',  and present in ', Libya', , ', Gabon', , ', Nigeria', , ', Sudan', , ', Venezuela', , ', Mozambique', , ', Yemen', , ', Iran', , ', Bangladesh',  and United States. OIL has recently emerged in the offshore giant gas-field project of Mozambique and also made discovery of ', oil & gas',  in ', Gabon',  as an Operator and ', Libya',  as non-operator. OIL acquired Shale oil asset in United States during 2012.', 
', In recent years, OIL has stepped up E & P activities significantly in the North-East India. OIL has set up the NEF (', North East Frontier', ) project to intensify its exploration activities in the frontier areas in North East, which are logistically very difficult and geologically complex.', [', citation needed', ]',  Presently, exploration activities are in progress along the Trust Belt areas of Arunachal, Assam including Mizoram. The Company operates a crude oil pipeline in th', 
', History', [', edit', ]', 
', A 1,157-kilometre (719 mi) long fully automated telemetric pipeline with 212 kilometres (132 mi) of looping and a total capacity to transport over 6.0 MMTPA remains the lifeline of the company. Commissioned in 1962, the double skinned crude oil pipeline traverses 78 rivers including the ', Brahmaputra River',  as it meanders through paddy fields, forests and swamps. There are 11 pumping stations, 18 repeater stations and two terminals at ', Numaligarh',  and ', Rongapani', . The engines that drive the giant pumps along the pipeline have more than two hundred thousand hours of service and established a world record of machine hours.', [', citation needed', ]', 
', OIL completed the construction of a 660-kilometre (410 mi) pipeline from Numaligarh to ', Siliguri',  in November 2007. The company also sells its gas to different customers in Assam: ', BVFCL', , ', ASEB', , ', NEEPCO', , ', IOC (AOD)', , and ', APL',  as well as to ', RSEB',  in ', Rajasthan', . It also produces liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) at its plant in ', Duliajan', , Assam.',
