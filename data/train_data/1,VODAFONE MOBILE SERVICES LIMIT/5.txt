      ', For more detailed information ', click here', 
      ', 
      ', 6.1 Why is TPG mobile moving to the Vodafone network?', 
      ',  TPG has been involved in building fibre optic cables to Vodafone mobile base stations as part of their effort in transforming and improving their mobile network. As Vodafone\u2019s key construction partner, we are in a great position to understand the improved quality of the Vodafone mobile network. ', 
        ', 
        We are so confident about our work with Vodafone that we have decided to move our mobile customer base from the Optus network to the Vodafone network. ', 
      ', 
      ', 6.2 Will TPG invite me to move to the Vodafone network?', 
      ', 
      Yes. We are inviting customers to move to the Vodafone network in batches as there are limitations on the number of customers that we and the industry can accommodate transferring daily. Eventually all TPG mobile customers in the Optus network will be invited to move. The entire migration process will take several months.
      ', 
      ', 
      ', 6.3 Will I need a new SIM card in the Vodafone network?', 
      ', Yes. Once you are invited, we will send you a new SIM card which you need to activate in order to start your new plan on the Vodafone network. The SIM card we use is a multi-fit "Magic SIM card" which has all 3 SIM sizes (Standard, Micro and Nano) in one card so you will be covered no matter which SIM type you need. You can pop out the size SIM you need, and pop the pieces back together if you need a larger size.', 
      ', 
      ', 6.4 If I accept the invitation, will my number get transferred across to the Vodafone network?', 
      ', Yes, your mobile number will be transferred to the Vodafone network automatically after you activate your new TPG SIM card. You will remain a TPG customer.', 
      ', 
      ', 6.5 Will there be any changes to my mobile plan?', 
      ', There may be changes to your mobile plan in the Vodafone network. In general, the changes are beneficial for you but please go through the details of your new plan including the Critical Information Summary to assess whether it is suitable for you.', 
      ', 
      ', u"6.6 What happens if I don't want to move to the Vodafone network?", 
      ', We do expect to eventually discontinue our mobile plans in the Optus network. We are confident in the service and plans we offer on the Vodafone network and we recommend you accept the invitation to move to the Vodafone network as early as possible. If you do not accept the invitation and your existing plan is discontinued in the future, we will of course provide you with the appropriate notice.', 
      ', 
      ', 6.7 How can I check the mobile coverage in my area and if my device is compatible with the Vodafone network?', 
      ', Please check our ', mobile coverage page', .', 
      ', 
      ', 6.8 Will I have access to the Vodafone 4G network?', 
      ', Yes, all TPG mobile plans in the Vodafone network have access to the Vodafone 4G network. However, you can only obtain 4G speeds when you use a 4G-ready phone (LTE 1800/850 MHz) in 4G coverage areas as per our ', mobile coverage map', . If you are not within a 4G coverage area or your mobile handset is not 4G compatible, the mobile service will automatically switch over to 3G or 2G and speeds will be much less than that of 4G.', 
      ', 
      ', 6.9 Is there any fee I have to pay to move to the Vodafone network?', 
      ', No. Once you are invited to move to the Vodafone network, we will send a new SIM card to you free of charge. ', 
      ', 
      ', 6.10 Can I get a current plan TPG sells rather than the one being offered to me in the invitation?', 
      ', Yes. When you activate your new TPG SIM card online, you will be given the option to choose from the plan specified in the invitation we sent to you and the plans TPG currently sells.', 
      ', 
      ', 6.11 Someone I know received an invitation from TPG with a different offer from the invitation I received. Can I get that offer?', 
      ', No, the offer is available only for the TPG mobile service number addressed in the invitation. The offer made to you is based on your existing mobile plan.',
