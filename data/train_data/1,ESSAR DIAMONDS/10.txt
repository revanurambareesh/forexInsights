Like the 80,000crore advances to the Bhushan Group. The consortium leaders (separately for Term Loans and Working Capital) SBI and PNB are forcing the member banks to pump in good public money to keep alive the loans. Having thrown away nearly a lakh crore of public money, PSBs have sanctioned fresh loans to Bhushan to enable the borrower to repay the installments and interest due.  There can be no doubt that the Bhushan loans constitute unsustainable debt. The SBI CMD made a statement that the Bhushan steel plants in Orissa are &acirc;Äúworking very well&acirc;Äù. This is typical of the disinformation put out by the PSBs and the RBI. PSBs are, as a matter of routine manipulating the Core Banking System to prevent the correct reporting of bad assets. Last year PSBs have transferred nearly a lakh crore of fraudulent loans to ARCs they themselves set up. By so doing they have removed these toxic assets from their books and saved the executives who sanctioned these loans from scrutiny. Worse, PSBs are treating the loans transferred to ARCs as full recovery when there is no real recovery. Balance sheets are cooked up by PSBs since the last several years to hide their real condition. The RBI has permitted PSBs from this year to appoint their own central auditors making fudging balance sheets even more easy. The RBI has also stopped the direct inspection of large branches of commercial banks', Krishnan ', (Chennai)',  ', How innocently the RBI Guv is talking. He is party to the NPA cover up of PSBs. The RBI should be ashamed.', Banker ', (Mumbai)',  ', It does not require the insight of a RBI Governor to predict what will happen to the high value loan accounts parked by the PSBs in CDR and restructured assets. The majority of the lakhs of crores of loans put in CDR or were restructured by PSBs are fraudulent and therefore unrecoverable loans. The promoters of infra projects had with the connivance of the top most bank officials, the politicians and the RBI, yes the RBI, diverted the loan funds. These advances have not resulted in the creation of any worthwhile assets. Hence the banks have put these accounts in CDR or restructured them not with the hope of reviving them, but to delay the classification as NPA, to try to avoid investigations into the manner in which the loans were sanctioned and the diversion of funds. Simply buying time. A latest example of such an account in CDR is IVRCL. Study the CDR terms and you will know that the promoters have no stake in this account today. The entire process is an exercise in hiding lakhs of crores of NPA. Indeed, what the RBI and the top brass of PSBs is doing today is just one thing:hiding NPAs. Even going to the extent of massive manipulation of accounting procedures.', Banker ', (Mumbai)',  replies to ', Dulla Chandra Sekhar',  ', Open organized looting of the UPA years.

Like the 80,000crore advances to the Bhushan Group. The consortium leaders (separately for Term Loans and Working Capital) SBI and PNB are forcing the member banks to pump in good public money to keep alive the loans. Having thrown away nearly a lakh crore of public money, PSBs have sanctioned fresh loans to Bhushan to enable the borrower to repay the installments and interest due.  There can be no doubt that the Bhushan loans constitute unsustainable debt. The SBI CMD made a statement that the Bhushan steel plants in Orissa are &acirc;Äúworking very well&acirc;Äù. This is typical of the disinformation put out by the PSBs and the RBI. PSBs are, as a matter of routine manipulating the Core Banking System to prevent the correct reporting of bad assets. Last year PSBs have transferred nearly a lakh crore of fraudulent loans to ARCs they themselves set up. By so doing they have removed these toxic assets from their books and saved the executives who sanctioned these loans from scrutiny. Worse, PSBs are treating the loans transferred to ARCs as full recovery when there is no real recovery. Balance sheets are cooked up by PSBs since the last several years to hide their real condition. The RBI has permitted PSBs from this year to appoint their own central auditors making fudging balance sheets even more easy. The RBI has also stopped the direct inspection of large branches of commercial banks', Krishnan ', (Chennai)',  ', How innocently the RBI Guv is talking. He is party to the NPA cover up of PSBs. The RBI should be ashamed.', Banker ', (Mumbai)',  ', It does not require the insight of a RBI Governor to predict what will happen to the high value loan accounts parked by the PSBs in CDR and restructured assets. The majority of the lakhs of crores of loans put in CDR or were restructured by PSBs are fraudulent and therefore unrecoverable loans. The promoters of infra projects had with the connivance of the top most bank officials, the politicians and the RBI, yes the RBI, diverted the loan funds. These advances have not resulted in the creation of any worthwhile assets. Hence the banks have put these accounts in CDR or restructured them not with the hope of reviving them, but to delay the classification as NPA, to try to avoid investigations into the manner in which the loans were sanctioned and the diversion of funds. Simply buying time. A latest example of such an account in CDR is IVRCL. Study the CDR terms and you will know that the promoters have no stake in this account today. The entire process is an exercise in hiding lakhs of crores of NPA. Indeed, what the RBI and the top brass of PSBs is doing today is just one thing:hiding NPAs. Even going to the extent of massive manipulation of accounting procedures.', Banker ', (Mumbai)',  replies to ', Dulla Chandra Sekhar',  ', Open organized looting of the UPA years.
