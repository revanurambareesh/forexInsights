', Early life and amateur career', [', edit', ]', 
', The son of ', Dartmouth',  graduates, Jason Heyward was born in ', Ridgewood, New Jersey', . His father, Eugene, is from ', South Carolina', , and mother, Laura, is from New York City; they met at Dartmouth. Eugene played ', basketball',  and majored in ', engineering',  and Laura studied French.', [3]', u" Eugene's uncle, ", Kenny Washington', , played ', basketball',  for two ', John Wooden', -led ', NCAA',  ', championship',  ', UCLA',  teams in ', 1964',  and ', 1965', .', [4]',  Jason has one younger brother, Jacob, who attends the ', University of Miami',  and plans to major within the school of ', communication',  and also plays ', baseball',  for the ', Hurricanes', .', [5]', 
', The Heywards moved to the ', Atlanta metropolitan area',  soon after he was born. Jason played and showed marked ability in ', baseball', u" from an early age. Before he turned 10, he played for a national championship. In fact, Eugene helped fuel both of his sons' passion for baseball. He dedicated himself to driving them to every ", tournament',  and competition possible in the family ', Chevrolet Suburban', , which saw hundreds of thousands of miles between the events and his 90-minute work commute to and from ', Robins Air Force Base',  to the south in ', Houston County', .', [6]', 
', While his father emphasized that working hard and approaching the game with discipline were important, it was to be \u2013 above all \u2013 fun. Heyward maintained this same approach throughout his youth and professional career. One tournament in which he played was the renowned ', East Cobb Baseball',  program, where he was a standout, and has produced other major league players.', [6]',  Heyward attended ', Henry County High School',  in ', McDonough',  near ', Atlanta', u". Heyward briefly played basketball in his youth, but concentrated exclusively on baseball in high school after his father's urging. In February 2010, an ", Associated Press', u" reporter learned from a varsity coach that Heyward's early batting practice exploits proved fatal to an oak tree in deep center field at the high school playing field.", [3]', 
', Facing off against future ', Major League Baseball',  (MLB) ', catcher',  ', Buster Posey',  of ', Lee County High', u" in the Georgia Class AAAA baseball championship during Heyward's sophomore year, Henry County won two of the best-of-three series. Posey was actually the ", starting pitcher',  in the first game as Henry Country prevailed, 2\u20131. Heyward hit a game-tying 400 feet (120 m) ', home run', u" in Game 2 to cap an eight-run comeback, but Lee County prevailed 14\u201310. The next game, Heyward's three-run single proved the game and series winner in a 16\u201314 outcome.", [7]',  During his junior season, he again helped lead the Henry County High Warhawks to the state championship.', [8]',  As a senior, he ', batted',  .520 with eight home runs (HR) and 29 ', runs batted in',  (RBI).', [9]', 
', u"One of Heyward's close friends and teammates from the 2005 AAAA Georgia state championship team,", [10]',  Andrew Wilmot, died in a ', traffic collision',  while attending college. Wilmot was a catcher who wore the ', uniform', u" number 22, the number Heyward would later wear in his major league career to honor him. Wilmot's mother, Tammie Ruston, was Heyward's high school literature teacher in his senior year.", [11]', 
', Numerous colleges showed interest and recruited Heyward, including ', UCLA', , which offered a full-ride ', scholarship',  due in part to the family connection.', [4]',  Heyward was also especially interested in ', Clemson',  and ', Georgia Tech', .', [12]',  Concurrently, the hometown ', Atlanta Braves',  had followed and scouted him for years, while attempting to conceal their excitement.', [6]',  They made him the 14th overall selection in the ', 2007 Major League Baseball draft', . Despite signing a ', National Letter of Intent',  with UCLA,', [12]',  Heyward chose ', professional baseball',  over college and signed a contract with them worth $1.7 million \u2013 $170,000 more than ', MLB', u"'s slot recommendation of $1.53 million on the following August 12. It was the same as the ", 2006',  14th-slot amount that the ', Toronto Blue Jays',  gave ', Travis Snider', .', [9]', [13]',

', 
', 
', After a rapid ascent through the minor leagues, the Braves invited Heyward to ', spring training',  in March ', 2010', . There, his hitting continued to draw notice, as he routinely hit "rockets" all over the field and over the fences, compelling ', manager',  ', Bobby Cox',  to make him a regular in the lineup.', [10]', u" He mentioned that he heard a different, more pronounced sound, of the balls hit off Heyward's bat. ", Reggie Jackson', , a ', New York Yankees',  special assistant, concurred, characterizing that sound as "', stereo', ", while everyone else was "in ', AM', ." Heyward hit two notable batting practice home runs at the ', Champion Stadium',  training complex in the ', Lake Buena Vista, Florida', . One damaged a ', Coca-Cola',  truck in the parking lot, and another broke the ', sunroof', u" of Atlanta Braves' assistant ", general manager', u" Bruce Manno's car.", [3]',  He was initially issued uniform number 71. At the end of spring training, he asked the team for, and received, number 22. He presented one of his jerseys with the number 22 to Ruston to show that he honored her son, which elicited an emotional reaction from her.', [10]', 
', By now one of the most anticipated prospects in all baseball, shirts depicting his ', nickname', , "The J-Hey Kid", were in high demand before he even played his first official major league game. ', Fans',  and ', pundits',  prognosticated on a future ', Hall of Fame',  career, eliciting comparisons to former greats such as ', Darryl Strawberry', , ', Willie McCovey',  and ', Willie Mays', , among many others. In fact, "The J-Hey Kid" was drawn from Mays' own nickname, "The Say Hey Kid." On March 26, after leading the club in on-base and slugging percentages in spring training, the Braves named Heyward their starting ', right fielder', .', [3]', 
', u"Eugene Heyward purchased 60 tickets in advance of his son's MLB debut on April 5 against the ", Chicago Cubs', u". Wearing Heyward's #22 jersey, Ruston was also in attendance for the game.", [23]',  During his ', first MLB plate appearance',  \u2013 and first swing at an MLB pitch \u2013 Heyward hit a ', three-run home run', , estimated at 471 feet (144 m), off starter ', Carlos Zambrano', .', [24]',  The ball landed near the right field seats where Ruston was sitting.', [10]',  Heyward became the fifth player in Braves history to hit a home run in his first major league at bat, and the eleventh in franchise history to do so in his MLB debut, on the heels of ', Jordan Schafer', , who did it the previous year.', [23]', 
', u"Through Atlanta's first 50 games, Heyward robustly lived up to the hype, hitting 10 home runs while batting .301 with a .421 OBP and .596 slugging percentage.", [25]',  He was named the ', National League',  (NL) ', Rookie of the Month',  in both April', [26]',  and May.', [27]',  However, after sustaining a thumb injury while sliding in May, he missed playing time. After he returned later in the season, his performance declined, and consistency was elusive.', [25]',  He was selected as a starter for the NL ', All-Star',  team, but did not participate due to the thumb injury.', [28]', 
', After stealing home in a double steal against the ', Washington Nationals',  in the first inning on July 28, he became the first Brave to do so since ', Rafael Furcal', , who did it more than ten years earlier.', [29]', u" A 16\u20135 victory over the Cubs on August featured Heyward's first MLB multi-home run game and career highs in hits and runs scored with four each.", [30]',  In the final 112 games of the season, Heyward batted .266 with a .381 OBP and .396 SLG.', [25]',  His ', postseason',  debut was on October 7 in the ', National League Division Series',  (NLDS) against the ', San Francisco Giants', .

', Heyward finished his first major league season with a .277 batting average, .393 on-base percentage, 18 HR, 29 doubles, 91 bases on balls, and 83 runs scored in 142 regular season games. He ranked fourth overall in the NL in OBP and walks.', [34]',  His longest streak of reaching base was 36 consecutive games.', [22]',  At the time, his OBP was the second-highest in major league history for a rookie aged 20 years or younger, after ', Ted Williams',  and before ', Frank Robinson', ,', [35]',  and OPS of .849 placed 30th in all MLB history counting rookie seasons.', [36]',  The recipient of several major awards, Heyward was named the ', Sporting News',  NL ', Rookie of the Year', ,', [37]',  ', u"Baseball America'", s ', MLB Rookie of the Year', u", an outfielder on the magazine's All-Rookie Team,", [38]',  and to ', Topps', u"' ", Major League Rookie All-Star Team', .', [39]',  He finished second to Posey for the NL ', Rookie of the Year',  award', [40]',  and 20th in the NL ', Most Valuable Player',  (MVP) award balloting.', [34]', 
', 2011', [', edit', ]', 
', u"Heyward's ", second MLB season',  commenced in a fashion that reprised the high expectations from his rookie season, but injuries ultimately factored into a lengthy and dramatic slump. In the spring, he was diagnosed with a degenerative condition in his lower back.', [25]',  Like his first MLB at-bat, he began with a home run in his first at-bat of the season on March 31, off ', Nationals',  pitcher ', Liván Hernández', . He became just the second player, after ', Kazuo Matsui', , to homer in his first major league at-bat on opening day, and do the same the following year.', [41]',  Since being drafted in 2007, it was also the third time Heyward homered in his first game of the season.',

', From the beginning of spring training, Heyward endured lingering shoulder soreness. After collecting just four hits in 41 at bats in May,', [46]',  the Braves performed a ', magnetic resonance imaging',  (MRI) scan on May 12 which revealed an ', inflamed',  ', rotator cuff',  but no structural damage.', [47]',  He rested and received a ', cortisone',  injection, but aggravated the injury days later during batting practice. The Braves placed him on the ', disabled list',  (DL) on May 22.', [46]',  Public criticism from teammate ', Chipper Jones',  for not playing through his injuries followed the next month. Said Jones, "I think where Jason might have erred was the comment that he made, 'I'm not coming back until it doesn't hurt anymore.' ... What Jason needs to realize is that Jason at 80 percent is a force, and Jason at 80 percent is better than a lot of people in this league."', [48]', u" Jones later explained that he reassured Heyward in a phone call that he did not intend to misrepresent Heyward's efforts to rehabilitate.", [49]', 
', Heyward returned from the DL with increased difficulty to drive the ball while batting.', [44]',  A sixth-inning home run against the ', Baltimore Orioles', u" on July 1 was Heyward's first since April 29 against the ", St. Louis Cardinals', , a span of 104 at-bats.', [50]',  However, he hit just four home runs from the end of April through August 11. Further, his walk rate declined from 14.6 ', percent',  the year before to 10.7 percent. His line drive rate in that time dropped from 17.8 to 13 percent and one-quarter of his balls hit in the air were infield pop-ups, compared with eight percent the year before.', [44]',  During a game against the ', Chicago Cubs',  on August 23, he hit his first career ', grand slam', .', [51]', 
', Through the end of August, the Braves were the NL ', wild card',  leader. However, the Cardinals overcame a ', \u200a', 10',  ', 1', \u2044', 2', -game deficit for the wild card position by winning 20 of their final 28 to eliminate the Braves from the playoffs on the final day, consummating one of the epic late-season collapses in MLB history.', [52]', [53]', u" After battling a shoulder injury from the beginning of the season, Heyward's overall performance dropped off from his rookie season. His batting average dropped 50 points to .227; his other contributions, also in decline, included 14 HR, 42 RBI, 18 doubles, and nine stolen bases in 128 games. He batted .240 against right-handed pitchers, compared with .192 against left-handers.", [50]',

', To remedy the decline in performance from the season before, Heyward took extra steps in his preseason preparation. He streamlined his swing to mitigate bad habits incorporated after the shoulder injury. He modified his diet to include more ', fruits', , ', chicken', , and ', fish', . Further, he participated in ', physical therapy',  to strengthen the shoulder and worked for a leaner weight, dropping from 256 pounds (116 kg) to 235 pounds (107 kg).', [54]',  He started the ', 2012',  season slowly. However, his bases loaded double on May 13 off ', Lance Lynn',  proved the game-winning run as the Braves triumphed over the ', Cardinals', , 7\u20134.', [55]', 
', With a .233 batting average through May,', [56]',  his production increased in June. His first multi-HR game of the season, and second of his career, on June 7 helped secure an 8\u20132 victory over the ', Marlins', .', [57]',  That month, he batted .353 with six HR and a 1.080 OPS. He also registered four outfield ', assists', , including one that ', put',  ', Mark Teixeira',  out at ', home plate',  on June 19, preserving a 4\u20133 win over the ', New York Yankees', .', [58]', 
', The following game, also at ', Yankee Stadium', , he launched two home runs for his third career \u2013 and second of the season \u2013 multi-HR game. It was a contest that featured nine home runs between the two clubs, tying a Yankee Stadium record, including the ', original incarnation',  built in ', 1923', .', [59]',  That same week, ending June 24, he won his first NL ', Player of the Week Award', .

Heyward in the outfield at Busch Stadium in 2015', 
', 
', 
', Standing 6 feet 5 inches (1.96 m) and weighing 245 pounds (111 kg), Heyward has shown to be an all-round talent. In the minor leagues, his ability to hit for batting average and power, speed, plus defense and arm strength sufficient to play right field, caused him to be considered a ', five-tool player', .', [21]', [102]',  Further, his plate discipline and ability to draw walks are unusual for a player his height.', [21]',  He generates much of his power as a ', pull hitter', .', [44]', 
', From very early in his career, Heyward has played with an outside anticipation of developing into one of the most dominant players in the league.', [3]', [103]',  However, he has mentioned being uncomfortable with the pressure that comes with such expectations. Journalist ', Bernie Miklasz',  of the ', St. Louis Post-Dispatch',  opined that the pressures of stardom obliquely induced the overall descent in performance from his rookie season.', [104]', 
', Heyward still has a hole in his swing that has yet to resolve. While he was in the minor leagues, his unorthodox swing was not regarded as a significant issue, but rather was perceived to have worked for him because of his enormous talent. To the contrary, one ', scout',  compared it to an awkward golf swing. "You watch him, he really stiff-arms the bat out there", noting Heyward almost fully extends his arms to attempt to power the head of the bat through the strike zone. He does not protect the inside of part of the strike zone as well as the outside. That creates a weakness that allows pitchers \u2013 especially ', power pitchers',  \u2013 to throw inside, thus exploiting an inability to attain contact on inside pitches efficiently.', [105]', 
', "The ball he hits well is the ball out away from him", according to the same scout. "If pitchers pitch around him, on the outer half, he'll crush it. ... That's why Niese hit him: He went up and in, and Heyward's a diver." Indeed, charts from ', STATS LLC',  depicting Heyward's "Hot Zones", or a hitter's zones of maximum effectiveness, corroborate the scout's findings. Through April 25, 2014, Heyward had swung at 22 of 55 pitches in 2014 that qualified as "up and in", crossing the plate either to the upper left ninth of the strike zone or slightly higher or inside of it. None of those 22 swings had produced a hit.', [105]', 
', However, an injury contributed to lost power in 2011. Before that point, Heyward dropped his hands after the start of the swing and rotated his front shoulder in an upward motion in his mode as a pull hitter. Normally, the front half of his upper body generates bat velocity. During the time the injury had not properly healed, it hindered his ability to generate torque from his front shoulder that contributed most to driving the ball.', [44]',

A sample of Heyward's batting stroke against the ", Arizona Diamondbacks',  in 2015', [106]', 
', 
', 
', In spite of not reaching his offensive projections, his defense has delivered as promised. Heyward has been rated as one of the top right fielders, if not the top right fielder, in MLB. The Fielding Bible staff has said that he "is the best defensive right fielder in baseball, bar none,". He is an expert at instantly picking up and reacting to the path of the batted ball and following it with efficient routes.', [75]',  Such defensive ability was demonstrated on a fly ball off ', Justin Turner', u"'s bat during the 2013 season. The same play was part of a demonstration in 2014 of ", Major League Baseball Advanced Media', u"'s ", Statcast',  system, a hybrid of ', PITCHf/x', , FIELDf/x and a ', radar', -based play tracking. Statcast analyzed that Heyward got a jump off the fly ball the bat in ', \u200a', 2', \u2044', 100',  second, ran at 18.5 miles per hour (29.8 km/h) and took a route with a 97% efficiency. The ball had 4.0 seconds of hang time and he ran 80.9 feet (24.7 m) for the catch.', [107]', 
', In rating of three zones to where the ball is hit in right field in his first five seasons, he was above average at saving bases', [a]',  on shallow-hit (+31) and medium-hit (+40) balls. His greatest strength came with deep-hit balls (+140). In 2014 alone, he saved +40 bases on balls hit to the deepest part of right field, which was the equivalent of 20 doubles.', [75]',  The enormous ground coverage makes up for what would be considered a slightly below average arm among right fielders.', [63]',  Commented Fielding Bible founder John Dewan, "Heyward has been able to accomplish this (winning the Fielding Bible Award) by starting and finishing every play extremely well. He excels at picking up the ball off the bat and rarely takes the wrong angle. He is not afraid to dive, demonstrating tremendous body control when doing so."', [92]', 
', Outside baseball', [', edit', ]', 
', In September 2012, ', Piedmont Henry Hospital',  in ', Stockbridge, Georgia', , selected Heyward as one of ten representatives for their Real Men Wear Pink campaign against ', breast cancer', . He stated at the time one of his grandmothers was battling the condition but had improved, and that her battle was an inspiration for him to participate.', [108]', 
', u"Heyward's brother, Jacob, is an ", outfielder',  in the ', San Francisco Giants',  organization.', [109]',  He was drafted by the Braves out of high school in the ', 2013 MLB Draft',  and the ', San Francisco Giants',  in the ', 2016 MLB Draft', .', [110]', [111]',

', Early life and amateur career', [', edit', ]', 
', The son of ', Dartmouth',  graduates, Jason Heyward was born in ', Ridgewood, New Jersey', . His father, Eugene, is from ', South Carolina', , and mother, Laura, is from New York City; they met at Dartmouth. Eugene played ', basketball',  and majored in ', engineering',  and Laura studied French.', [3]', u" Eugene's uncle, ", Kenny Washington', , played ', basketball',  for two ', John Wooden', -led ', NCAA',  ', championship',  ', UCLA',  teams in ', 1964',  and ', 1965', .', [4]',  Jason has one younger brother, Jacob, who attends the ', University of Miami',  and plans to major within the school of ', communication',  and also plays ', baseball',  for the ', Hurricanes', .', [5]', 
', The Heywards moved to the ', Atlanta metropolitan area',  soon after he was born. Jason played and showed marked ability in ', baseball', u" from an early age. Before he turned 10, he played for a national championship. In fact, Eugene helped fuel both of his sons' passion for baseball. He dedicated himself to driving them to every ", tournament',  and competition possible in the family ', Chevrolet Suburban', , which saw hundreds of thousands of miles between the events and his 90-minute work commute to and from ', Robins Air Force Base',  to the south in ', Houston County', .', [6]', 
', While his father emphasized that working hard and approaching the game with discipline were important, it was to be \u2013 above all \u2013 fun. Heyward maintained this same approach throughout his youth and professional career. One tournament in which he played was the renowned ', East Cobb Baseball',  program, where he was a standout, and has produced other major league players.', [6]',  Heyward attended ', Henry County High School',  in ', McDonough',  near ', Atlanta', u". Heyward briefly played basketball in his youth, but concentrated exclusively on baseball in high school after his father's urging. In February 2010, an ", Associated Press', u" reporter learned from a varsity coach that Heyward's early batting practice exploits proved fatal to an oak tree in deep center field at the high school playing field.", [3]', 
', Facing off against future ', Major League Baseball',  (MLB) ', catcher',  ', Buster Posey',  of ', Lee County High', u" in the Georgia Class AAAA baseball championship during Heyward's sophomore year, Henry County won two of the best-of-three series. Posey was actually the ", starting pitcher',  in the first game as Henry Country prevailed, 2\u20131. Heyward hit a game-tying 400 feet (120 m) ', home run', u" in Game 2 to cap an eight-run comeback, but Lee County prevailed 14\u201310. The next game, Heyward's three-run single proved the game and series winner in a 16\u201314 outcome.", [7]',  During his junior season, he again helped lead the Henry County High Warhawks to the state championship.', [8]',  As a senior, he ', batted',  .520 with eight home runs (HR) and 29 ', runs batted in',  (RBI).', [9]', 
', u"One of Heyward's close friends and teammates from the 2005 AAAA Georgia state championship team,", [10]',  Andrew Wilmot, died in a ', traffic collision',  while attending college. Wilmot was a catcher who wore the ', uniform', u" number 22, the number Heyward would later wear in his major league career to honor him. Wilmot's mother, Tammie Ruston, was Heyward's high school literature teacher in his senior year.", [11]', 
', Numerous colleges showed interest and recruited Heyward, including ', UCLA', , which offered a full-ride ', scholarship',  due in part to the family connection.', [4]',  Heyward was also especially interested in ', Clemson',  and ', Georgia Tech', .', [12]',  Concurrently, the hometown ', Atlanta Braves',  had followed and scouted him for years, while attempting to conceal their excitement.', [6]',  They made him the 14th overall selection in the ', 2007 Major League Baseball draft', . Despite signing a ', National Letter of Intent',  with UCLA,', [12]',  Heyward chose ', professional baseball',  over college and signed a contract with them worth $1.7 million \u2013 $170,000 more than ', MLB', u"'s slot recommendation of $1.53 million on the following August 12. It was the same as the ", 2006',  14th-slot amount that the ', Toronto Blue Jays',  gave ', Travis Snider', .', [9]', [13]',

', GCL Braves, Danville, Rome, and Myrtle Beach (2007\u201308)', [', edit', ]', 
', At age 17, Heyward started his professional career in ', Minor League Baseball', u" in the Braves' system. He played for both the ", Gulf Coast League',  ', Braves',  and the ', Danville Braves',  of the ', Appalachian League',  in 2007.

Heyward in the outfield at Busch Stadium in 2015', 
', 
', 
', Standing 6 feet 5 inches (1.96 m) and weighing 245 pounds (111 kg), Heyward has shown to be an all-round talent. In the minor leagues, his ability to hit for batting average and power, speed, plus defense and arm strength sufficient to play right field, caused him to be considered a ', five-tool player', .', [21]', [102]',  Further, his plate discipline and ability to draw walks are unusual for a player his height.', [21]',  He generates much of his power as a ', pull hitter', .', [44]', 
', From very early in his career, Heyward has played with an outside anticipation of developing into one of the most dominant players in the league.', [3]', [103]',  However, he has mentioned being uncomfortable with the pressure that comes with such expectations. Journalist ', Bernie Miklasz',  of the ', St. Louis Post-Dispatch',  opined that the pressures of stardom obliquely induced the overall descent in performance from his rookie season.', [104]', 
', Heyward still has a hole in his swing that has yet to resolve. While he was in the minor leagues, his unorthodox swing was not regarded as a significant issue, but rather was perceived to have worked for him because of his enormous talent. To the contrary, one ', scout',  compared it to an awkward golf swing. "You watch him, he really stiff-arms the bat out there", noting Heyward almost fully extends his arms to attempt to power the head of the bat through the strike zone. He does not protect the inside of part of the strike zone as well as the outside. That creates a weakness that allows pitchers \u2013 especially ', power pitchers',  \u2013 to throw inside, thus exploiting an inability to attain contact on inside pitches efficiently.', [105]', 
', "The ball he hits well is the ball out away from him", according to the same scout. "If pitchers pitch around him, on the outer half, he'll crush it. ... That's why Niese hit him: He went up and in, and Heyward's a diver." Indeed, charts from ', STATS LLC',  depicting Heyward's "Hot Zones", or a hitter's zones of maximum effectiveness, corroborate the scout's findings. Through April 25, 2014, Heyward had swung at 22 of 55 pitches in 2014 that qualified as "up and in", crossing the plate either to the upper left ninth of the strike zone or slightly higher or inside of it. None of those 22 swings had produced a hit.', [105]', 
', However, an injury contributed to lost power in 2011. Before that point, Heyward dropped his hands after the start of the swing and rotated his front shoulder in an upward motion in his mode as a pull hitter. Normally, the front half of his upper body generates bat velocity. During the time the injury had not properly healed, it hindered his ability to generate torque from his front shoulder that contributed most to driving the ball.', [44]',

A sample of Heyward's batting stroke against the ", Arizona Diamondbacks',  in 2015', [106]', 
', 
', 
', In spite of not reaching his offensive projections, his defense has delivered as promised. Heyward has been rated as one of the top right fielders, if not the top right fielder, in MLB. The Fielding Bible staff has said that he "is the best defensive right fielder in baseball, bar none,". He is an expert at instantly picking up and reacting to the path of the batted ball and following it with efficient routes.', [75]',  Such defensive ability was demonstrated on a fly ball off ', Justin Turner', u"'s bat during the 2013 season. The same play was part of a demonstration in 2014 of ", Major League Baseball Advanced Media', u"'s ", Statcast',  system, a hybrid of ', PITCHf/x', , FIELDf/x and a ', radar', -based play tracking. Statcast analyzed that Heyward got a jump off the fly ball the bat in ', \u200a', 2', \u2044', 100',  second, ran at 18.5 miles per hour (29.8 km/h) and took a route with a 97% efficiency. The ball had 4.0 seconds of hang time and he ran 80.9 feet (24.7 m) for the catch.', [107]', 
', In rating of three zones to where the ball is hit in right field in his first five seasons, he was above average at saving bases', [a]',  on shallow-hit (+31) and medium-hit (+40) balls. His greatest strength came with deep-hit balls (+140). In 2014 alone, he saved +40 bases on balls hit to the deepest part of right field, which was the equivalent of 20 doubles.', [75]',  The enormous ground coverage makes up for what would be considered a slightly below average arm among right fielders.', [63]',  Commented Fielding Bible founder John Dewan, "Heyward has been able to accomplish this (winning the Fielding Bible Award) by starting and finishing every play extremely well. He excels at picking up the ball off the bat and rarely takes the wrong angle. He is not afraid to dive, demonstrating tremendous body control when doing so."', [92]', 
', Outside baseball', [', edit', ]', 
', In September 2012, ', Piedmont Henry Hospital',  in ', Stockbridge, Georgia', , selected Heyward as one of ten representatives for their Real Men Wear Pink campaign against ', breast cancer', . He stated at the time one of his grandmothers was battling the condition but had improved, and that her battle was an inspiration for him to participate.', [108]', 
', u"Heyward's brother, Jacob, is an ", outfielder',  in the ', San Francisco Giants',  organization.', [109]',  He was drafted by the Braves out of high school in the ', 2013 MLB Draft',  and the ', San Francisco Giants',  in the ', 2016 MLB Draft', .', [110]', [111]',

', a',  ', b',  Developed by the organization that awards ', The Fielding Bible', u", defensive runs saved (DRS) measures a player's total defensive plays made in terms of numbers of runs above or below what the average player at that position made. A calculation system computes the number of plays made league-wide at each position and a plus-minus total rating for each player compared to a league average player. For example, if Heyward made a play that only 20% of right fielders would make, he was credited with .8 points \u2013 or, 1 point minus .20. If he failed to make a play that 75% of right fielders made, then .75 points was subtracted from his score.", [112]',
