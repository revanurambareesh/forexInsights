', Manuel Arístides "Manny" Ramírez Onelcida',  (born May 30, 1972) is a ', Dominican-American',  ', professional baseball',  ', outfielder',  who played in ', Major League Baseball',  (MLB) for parts of 19 seasons. He played with the ', Cleveland Indians', , ', Boston Red Sox', , ', Los Angeles Dodgers', , ', Chicago White Sox', , and ', Tampa Bay Rays',  before playing one season in the ', Chinese Professional Baseball League', . Ramirez is recognized for having had great ', batting',  skill and power. He was a nine-time ', Silver Slugger',  and was one of 25 players to hit 500 career ', home runs', . His 21 ', grand slams',  are third all-time, and his 29 postseason home runs are the most in MLB history. He appeared in 12 ', All-Star Games', , with a streak of eleven consecutive games beginning in 1998 that included every season that he played with the Red Sox.', [1]', 
', Ramirez was born in ', Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic', . When he was 13 years old, he moved to New York City with his parents, Onelcida and Aristides. He attended ', George Washington High School',  and became a baseball standout. He was drafted by the ', Cleveland Indians',  in the first round of the ', 1991 MLB draft', , 13th overall. He made his MLB debut on September 2, 1993.', 
', In 1994, Ramirez became a major league regular, and finished second in voting for the ', Rookie of the Year Award', . By 1995, he had become an ', All-Star', . He was with the Indians in playoff appearances in 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, and 1999; this included an appearance in the ', 1995',  and ', 1997 World Series', u". In 1999, Ramirez set the Indians' single-season RBIs record with 165 RBIs. After the 2000 season, Ramirez signed with ", the Boston Red Sox', . During his time in Boston, Ramirez and teammate ', David Ortiz',  became one of the best offensive tandems in baseball history. Ramirez led the Red Sox to ', World Series',  Championships in ', 2004',  and ', 2007',  before being ', traded',  to the ', Los Angeles Dodgers',  in 2008 as part of a three team deal that also involved the ', Pittsburgh Pirates', .', 
', In ', 2009', u" Ramirez was suspended 50 games for violating baseball's drug policy by taking ", human chorionic gonadotropin', u" (hCG), a women's ", fertility drug',  that is often taken after ', steroids', .', [2]',  In the spring of 2011, Ramirez was informed by MLB of another violation of its drug policy,', [3]',  which would result in a 100-game suspension.', [4]',  He chose to retire on April 8 rather than face a 100-game suspension.', [4]', [5]',  However, in September 2011, Ramirez wished to be reinstated and agreed in December with the league to a reduced 50-game suspension. Though he played at various points in the ', Oakland Athletics', , ', Texas Rangers', , and ', Chicago Cubs',  systems, as well as internationally, Ramirez did not appear in another Major League game.', 
', Known as a complete hitter who could hit for both power and average, and widely regarded as one of the best right handed hitters of his generation, Ramirez finished his career with a lifetime .312 batting average, 555 home runs (15th all time), and 1831 RBI (18th all time).',

', Early life', [', edit', ]', 
', Ramirez was born in ', Santo Domingo', , ', Dominican Republic',  and spent thirteen years living there. As a child, Ramirez was obsessed with baseball. When he was eight years old, his grandmother got him a Dodgers uniform with the number 30 on the back, which he considers to be one of his most prized possessions.', [6]',  In 1985, he moved to the ', Washington Heights',  neighborhood of ', New York City',  with his parents.', [6]',  He would often play ball at the nearby ', Snake Hill', , the same place ', Lou Gehrig',  played during his childhood.', [6]',  Despite living just a short distance from ', Yankee Stadium', , Ramirez rooted for the ', Toronto Blue Jays',  and would watch games when the Blue Jays were in town.', [6]', 
', Ramirez attended ', George Washington High School',  from 1987 to 1991, leaving at the age of 19 without graduating.', [7]', u" During his time on the team, GWHS was seeing a large increase in the number of immigrants. This was apparent, as GWHS's baseball team was composed entirely of Dominicans.", [8]',  As a youth, Ramirez preferred to not be the center of attention and was often very modest.', [8]', 
', During his time at GWHS, he led his team to three straight division championships.', [6]',  He was a three-time all-city selection in baseball, and as a high school senior was named New York City Public School Player of the Year in 1991, hitting for a .650 ', batting average',  with 14 home runs in 22 games.', [8]',  He was inducted into the New York City Public School Athletic Hall of Fame in 1999.', [9]', 
', Career', [', edit', ]', 
', Minor leagues', [', edit', ]', 
', The ', Cleveland Indians',  selected Ramirez with the 13th pick of the ', 1991 draft',  and assigned him to the Rookie-level ', Burlington Indians',  for his professional debut.', [10]',  He was named the ', Appalachian League',  MVP and was selected by ', Baseball America',  as short-season Player of the Year while slugging 19 homers and driving in 63 runs in 59 games, while leading the league in slugging and total bases.', [10]', 
', With the Single-A ', Kinston Indians',  in 1992, Ramirez battled injuries but still hit .278 with 13 homers and 63 RBIs in 81 games and was named as the number three prospect and the "Most Exciting Player in the Carolina League" by Baseball America.', [10]', [11]',  In 1993, Ramirez was named "Minor League Player of the Year" by Baseball America while hitting .333 with 31 homers and 115 RBIs in 129 combined games with the Double-A ', Canton\u2013Akron Indians',  and Triple-A ', Charlotte Knights', .', [10]', [11]',

', Ramirez made his major league debut on September 2, 1993 against the ', Minnesota Twins', , going hitless in four ', at bats',  as the ', designated hitter', .', 
', The following day, when the Indians took on the ', New York Yankees', , Ramirez went 3 for 4 with his first two home runs, with many of his family and friends in attendance at ', Yankee Stadium', .', [1]', [12]',  His first career home run was hit against ', Mélido Pérez', .', [13]',  However, rather humorously, his first MLB hit off Perez was a ', ground rule double',  that bounced into the left field seats as left fielder ', u"Paul O'Neill", u" pursued it. Ramirez, seeing the ball in the seats, continued running thinking he had hit a home run, before returning to second base while his teammates ribbed him. After flying out to O'Neill in his next plate appearance, Ramirez homered in his final two at bats.", 
', In 1994, his first full season in the majors, Ramirez had a strong start to the season, hitting six home runs during the month of April.', [6]',  Despite a weak start to May, he rebounded in the latter half of the month, finishing the month with a .300 batting average.', [6]',  During the season, the Indians were chasing the ', Chicago White Sox',  for first place in the ', American League Central',  (AL Central) division all the way until the end of the season. However, the team fell short of qualifying for the playoffs and their season ended in August due to the ', 1994 MLB strike', .', [6]',  Ramirez finished second in the ', Rookie of the Year',  award voting after batting .269 with 17 home runs and 60 RBIs in 91 games.', [1]', 
', 1995\u20131997', [', edit', ]', 
', u"Ramirez's breakout season came in 1995, when he batted .308 with 31 home runs and 107 RBIs. In July, he was selected to his first ", All-Star Game',  and won his first career ', Silver Slugger Award',  following the season.', [1]',  That year, the Indians reached the postseason, and Ramirez hit two home runs in the ', 1995 American League Championship Series',  against the ', Mariners', , which the Indians won in six games. The Indians then took on the ', Atlanta Braves', u" in the World Series, and Ramirez batted .222 with one home run in the Indians' six-game loss.", [1]',  In December 1995, Ramirez agreed to a $10.15 million, four-year contract.', [14]', 
', u"Ramirez continued to hit well in 1996, batting .309 with 33 home runs and 112 RBIs. The Indians again reached the playoffs, and Ramirez batted .375 with 2 home runs in the Indians' loss to the Orioles in the ", 1996 American League Division Series', .', [1]', u" In 1997, Ramirez's contact continued to improve, though his power dipped slightly, as he hit .328 with 26 home runs and 88 RBIs. This year, the Indians again reached the ", World Series', , and Ramirez batted .154 with two home runs as the Indians lost to the ', Florida Marlins',  in seven games.', [1]', 
', 1998\u20132000', [', edit', ]', 
', In 1998, Ramirez experienced a great increase in power, on his way to becoming one of the great run producers in the game. He batted .294 with 45 home runs and 145 RBIs, and was selected to his second All-Star Game, where he recorded a ', sacrifice fly',  and RBI.', [15]',  Ramirez batted .357 with 2 home runs during the ', ALDS',  versus the Red Sox, which the Indians won in four games. In the ', ALCS',  against the Yankees, Ramirez batted .333 with two home runs, but the Indians lost in six games.', [1]',  Following the season, Ramirez came in sixth place in ', AL MVP',  voting.', [16]', 
', u"Ramirez began 1999 on a hot streak, hitting .337 with 7 home runs in the month of April. Ramirez's hot hitting continued all season, as he batted .364 in May and reached the All-Star break with 25 home runs and 96 RBIs.", [17]',  At the time, it was the third highest single season total for RBI by the All-Star Break in MLB history, behind only ', Hank Greenberg',  (103 in 1935) and ', Juan González', u" (101 in 1998). On September 30, 1999, Ramirez broke the Indians' single-season RBI record (previously 162 by ", Hal Trosky',  in 1936) by hitting a 3-run home run, giving Ramirez 164.', [18]',  He finished 1999 with 165 RBIs, the highest total by any player since ', Jimmie Foxx',  (1938), and batted an eye popping .383 against left handed pitchers. He also batted .383 with runners in scoring position, and .377 with men on base.', [1]',  That season, he finished third in the voting for the ', AL MVP',  award.', [19]',  However, he struggled in the 1999 postseason, going 1-for-18 as the Indians were eliminated by the ', Boston Red Sox',  in 5 games in the ', 1999 American League Division Series', .', 
', In 2000, Ramirez was limited to 118 games due to injuries, but recorded a career-high .351 batting average, along with 38 home runs and 122 RBIs.', [1]',  His return is believed to have started a major comeback that led the Indians to a final record of 90\u201372 and cut the number of games they were behind the leader of the AL Central, the ', Chicago White Sox', , from 11.5 games down to 7.5 games in just a month.', [20]',  Because of his return, ', Roberto Alomar', , ', Omar Vizquel', , and ', Kenny Lofton',  all started getting better pitches to hit, which also significantly increased their batting averages.', [20]',  Despite the comeback, the Indians failed to make the postseason, finishing 5 games behind the White Sox in the AL Central.', [21]',  With free agency looming, Ramirez homered in what would be his final game and at-bat in an Indians uniform, on October 1 against Toronto in front of the home fans at ', Jacobs Field', .',

Ramirez asking the first base umpire if he went around on a swing', 
', 
', 
', In November 2000, the Indians offered Ramirez a seven-year, $119 million contract. While this would have made Ramirez the highest-paid player in baseball, the deal was rejected by Ramirez and his agent, ', Jeff Moorad', , who were seeking a ten-year, $200 million contract.', [22]',  Ramirez was reportedly pursued by the New York Yankees and Seattle Mariners, but in December agreed to an eight-year, $160 million deal with the ', Boston Red Sox', , with $20 million options for 2009 and 2010, pushing the total value of the contract to $200 million for 10 years.', [23]', 
', Ramirez immediately delivered for the Red Sox, hitting .408 in April 2001. He had another sterling first half, amassing a .335 batting average with 26 home runs and 84 RBI at the 2001 All-Star break. However, he missed some time battling hamstring injuries and struggled down the stretch, finishing at .306 with 41 home runs and 125 RBI. On June 23, Ramirez hit two monstrous home runs against the ', Toronto Blue Jays',  at ', Fenway Park', , with the second one hitting the very top of the light tower in left field. Its length was officially listed at 501 feet,', [24]', u" second-longest by a Red Sox player in Fenway Park's history, just short of ", Ted Williams', u"' 1946 record of 502 feet.", [25]',  He also launched a prodigious home run in an away game on June 3 against the Blue Jays into the fifth deck at the ', SkyDome', u", which still stands as the longest home run in that ballpark's history at 491 feet. However, despite his efforts, the Red Sox did not qualify for the MLB postseason in 2001.", 
', Ramirez only played in 120 games in 2002 due to a hamstring injury that put him on the ', disabled list',  (DL) from mid-May to the end of June.', [6]',  Despite this, Ramirez won the AL batting title, hitting .349 (including .438 against lefties), and his .647 slugging percentage was second in the league behind ', Jim Thome', u"'s .677. Like clockwork, Ramirez again reached the 30 home run and 100 RBI plateaus, posting 33 and 107 respectively. He hit his 300th career home run on August 26 against the Angels' ", Ramón Ortiz', . It was the first of two home runs on the night for Ramirez, as he went 5-for-5 overall. However, the Red Sox again failed to qualify for the MLB postseason in 2002.', 
', In 2003, Ramirez again posted strong offensive numbers, finishing with a .325 average, 37 home runs, and 104 RBI. The second half surge of fellow Dominican slugger ', David Ortiz',  gave the Red Sox a formidable one-two punch in the middle of the lineup with Ramirez. However, in the summer, Ramirez missed several games with ', pharyngitis', ,', [6]',  but got into hot water as he was spotted in a bar in the hotel where he lived with a close friend, ', Yankees',  ', infielder',  ', Enrique Wilson', , despite being supposedly too ill to play in the series against the rival Yankees. Boston ', manager',  ', Grady Little',  benched Ramirez for one game as a result.', [26]',  Despite this distraction, the Red Sox finished the season 95-67, qualifying for the MLB postseason for the first time with Ramirez. In the decisive fifth game of their ', Division Series',  matchup against the ', Oakland Athletics', , Ramirez broke a 6th inning 1-1 tie by launching a go-ahead three-run homer off ', Barry Zito',  that set up an ALCS showdown with the rival Yankees. In ALCS Game 3, Ramirez was at the center of a bench-clearing brawl. Early in the game, Red Sox pitcher ', Pedro Martinez',  had hit Yankees outfielder ', Karim Garcia',  up high with a pitch, sparking heated dialogue, and a hard slide by Garcia into Red Sox second baseman ', Todd Walker',  had exacerbated the tensions. The very next inning, Yankees pitcher ', Roger Clemens', u" threw a pitch high and inside to Ramirez, and Manny charged the mound, sparking the melee. The Red Sox lost the game 4-3. Despite Ramirez's strong play in the ", ALCS',  against the Yankees (.310 with 2 home runs), the Red Sox fell to the Yankees in the decisive seventh game on ', Aaron Boone', u"'s infamous extra-inning, walk-off home run.", [27]', 
', During the offseason that followed, the new Red Sox ownership (led by ', John W. Henry', u") and management tried to rid themselves of Ramirez's massive contract, despite his high level of production to date. Believed to be necessary in pursuit of a trade for ", Texas Rangers',  shortstop ', Alex Rodriguez', , the team put Ramirez on irrevocable waivers, thus making him available to any team willing to assume the remainder of his contract. However, all 29 other teams passed on the opportunity to claim Ramirez due to the high cost,', [28]',  and Rodriguez was acquired by the Yankees instead, rather ironically as a replacement for Boone after the latter had blown out his knee playing offseason basketball.', 
', Also noteworthy from 2003 (though it would not be revealed until 2009), according to the ', New York Times', , Ramirez tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs that season from the "survey" drug test, in which MLB players were tested to see if drugs were being used. Players faced no penalties or sanctions for testing positive.', [29]',  Ramirez was one of 104 players to have allegedly tested positive.',

', 
', 
', In 2004, Ramirez led the AL in home runs (43), ', slugging percentage',  (.613) and ', OPS',  (1.009); he finished second in errors committed as a left fielder (7), third in RBIs (130), fourth in doubles (44) and total bases (348), sixth in ', on-base percentage',  (.397), eighth in ', walks',  (82), tenth in runs (108), and posted a .308 ', batting average', .', [1]',  He also led the AL in salary, at $22.5 million.', [1]', 
', In addition, Ramirez and teammate ', David Ortiz', u" became the first pair of AL teammates to hit 40 home runs, have 100 RBIs, and bat .300 since the Yankees' ", Babe Ruth',  and ', Lou Gehrig',  in 1931.', [30]',  Together they hit back-to-back home runs six times, tying the major league single-season mark set by the ', Detroit Tigers', u"' ", Hank Greenberg',  and ', Rudy York',  and later matched by the ', Chicago White Sox', u"'s ", Frank Thomas',  and ', Magglio Ordóñez', .', [30]', 
', In the ', 2004 Major League Baseball All-Star Game', , Ramirez hit a two-run home run off ', Roger Clemens',  in the top of the first inning, giving his teammates a 3\u20130 lead.', [31]',  Ramirez, ', Derek Jeter',  (with a ', single', ), ', Ichiro Suzuki',  (with a ', double', ) and ', Iván Rodríguez',  (with a ', triple', ) became the first All-Star quartet to ', hit for the cycle',  during the same inning.', [31]',  The Red Sox again qualified for the postseason, and Ramirez continued his hot hitting. He hit .385 in the ', 2004 ALDS', , leading the Red Sox to a sweep over the ', Anaheim Angels', , and setting up a rematch in the ', 2004 American League Championship Series',  against the Yankees. Despite not driving in a run in the ALCS, Ramirez hit .300 as the Red Sox completed a historic comeback from down 3 games to 0 to win in seven against the Yankees, setting up a showdown with the ', St. Louis Cardinals',  in the ', 2004 World Series', . Ramirez proceeded to hit .412 with a home run and 4 RBI in a 4-game sweep of the Cardinals, as the Red Sox won their first title since 1918. The home run came in the first inning of Game 3, off Cardinals starter ', Jeff Suppan', u", continuing a streak where the Red Sox scored in the first inning of each game in the series. Ramirez's 2004 season was capped off by being named ", World Series MVP', .', [31]', 
', 2005\u201306', [', edit', ]', 
', On May 15, 2005, Ramirez hit his 400th home run off ', Gil Meche',  of the ', Seattle Mariners', . On July 5, Ramirez hit his 20th career ', grand slam',  \u2014 and his third of the season \u2014 off ', Chris Young',  of the ', Texas Rangers', . On defense, however, he tied for the lead among all major league left fielders in errors, with 7.', [32]',  He posted his highest single season RBI total as a Red Sox in 2005, driving in 144 runs to go along with his 45 homers, but he batted "only" .292, his first time under .300 since 1998. Along with teammate ', David Ortiz', , who drove in 148 runs, the duo combined to drive in an outstanding 292 runs. Ortiz would finish second, and Ramirez fourth, in ', MVP',  voting to winner ', Alex Rodriguez', .', 
', Off the field, the season was one of much conflict for Ramirez.', [33]',  Persistent trade rumors (generally involving the ', New York Mets', ) dogged him all season.', [33]', u" After the Red Sox were eliminated in the first round of that year's playoffs by the eventual ", World Series',  champion ', Chicago White Sox', , Ramirez once again expressed a wish to be traded.', [34]',  This included a threat to not show up for ', spring training',  if his latest demand was not met by Red Sox GM ', Theo Epstein', .', [34]',  Toward this end, in December 2005, Ramirez put his ', Ritz-Carlton',  condominium up for sale.', [35]',  Trade rumors circulated with Ramirez possibly going to the ', Baltimore Orioles',  or the ', New York Mets', , but no deal was reached. By January 5, 2006, Ramirez changed his mind, stating that he was dropping the demand.', [36]',  His agents, in turn, insisted their client was still open to a trade.', [37]',  But no deal materialized.', 
', On June 10, 2006, Ramirez became the 31st player in history to hit 450 home runs, with a solo home run off ', Francisco Cordero',  of the Texas Rangers.', [', citation needed', ]',  Three weeks later, on July 1, he collected his 2000th ', hit', .', [38]',  Beginning in mid-July, he had a 28-game ', hitting streak', , including 12 multi-hit games, 8 HR, and 28 RBIs. He reached 100 RBI for the 9th consecutive season on August 20 in a series against the Yankees, but missed 28 games from mid-August on with soreness in his right knee.', [39]',  Ramirez finished at .321 with 35 home runs and 102 RBI. He also drew a career high 100 walks in 2006, the only time in his career he reached that mark. However, the Red Sox missed the playoffs for the first time since the 2002 season.',

', A heated altercation between Ramirez and teammate ', Kevin Youkilis',  took place on June 5, during a game at ', Fenway Park',  against the ', Tampa Bay Rays', .', [52]',  The ', Boston Globe',  speculated that Youkilis was angry that Ramirez has been slow to join a bench-clearing brawl earlier in the game.

During the series Ramirez was directed to an area hospital for MRIs on both his knees; the results showed no damage.', [59]', u" When back in action, Ramirez frequently failed to run out ground balls. Assuming that this was due to his displeasure about his contract situation (Ramirez could become a free agent at season's end, but the Red Sox held 2 years of team options they had not yet exercised), many Red Sox fans and reporters, including ", Dan Shaughnessy',  of the ', Boston Globe', , called for Ramirez to be traded.', [60]',  Despite all these distractions, Ramirez did continue to hit solidly when on the field, as he batted .299 with 20 home runs and 68 RBI through the first 100 games of the season.',

In 1999, Ramirez set the Indians' single-season RBIs record with 165 RBIs. After the 2000 season, Ramirez signed with ", the Boston Red Sox', . During his time in Boston, Ramirez and teammate ', David Ortiz',  became one of the best offensive tandems in baseball history. Ramirez led the Red Sox to ', World Series',  Championships in ', 2004',  and ', 2007',  before being ', traded',  to the ', Los Angeles Dodgers',  in 2008 as part of a three team deal that also involved the ', Pittsburgh Pirates', .', 
', In ', 2009', u" Ramirez was suspended 50 games for violating baseball's drug policy by taking ", human chorionic gonadotropin', u" (hCG), a women's ", fertility drug',  that is often taken after ', steroids', .', [2]',  In the spring of 2011, Ramirez was informed by MLB of another violation of its drug policy,', [3]',  which would result in a 100-game suspension.', [4]',  He chose to retire on April 8 rather than face a 100-game suspension.', [4]', [5]',  However, in September 2011, Ramirez wished to be reinstated and agreed in December with the league to a reduced 50-game suspension.

', Early life', [', edit', ]', 
', Ramirez was born in ', Santo Domingo', , ', Dominican Republic',  and spent thirteen years living there. As a child, Ramirez was obsessed with baseball. When he was eight years old, his grandmother got him a Dodgers uniform with the number 30 on the back, which he considers to be one of his most prized possessions.', [6]',  In 1985, he moved to the ', Washington Heights',  neighborhood of ', New York City',  with his parents.', [6]',  He would often play ball at the nearby ', Snake Hill', , the same place ', Lou Gehrig',  played during his childhood.', [6]',  Despite living just a short distance from ', Yankee Stadium', , Ramirez rooted for the ', Toronto Blue Jays',  and would watch games when the Blue Jays were in town.', [6]', 
', Ramirez attended ', George Washington High School',  from 1987 to 1991, leaving at the age of 19 without graduating.', [7]', u" During his time on the team, GWHS was seeing a large increase in the number of immigrants. This was apparent, as GWHS's baseball team was composed entirely of Dominicans.", [8]',  As a youth, Ramirez preferred to not be the center of attention and was often very modest.', [8]', 
', During his time at GWHS, he led his team to three straight division championships.', [6]',  He was a three-time all-city selection in baseball, and as a high school senior was named New York City Public School Player of the Year in 1991, hitting for a .650 ', batting average',  with 14 home runs in 22 games.', [8]',  He was inducted into the New York City Public School Athletic Hall of Fame in 1999.', [9]',

', With the Single-A ', Kinston Indians',  in 1992, Ramirez battled injuries but still hit .278 with 13 homers and 63 RBIs in 81 games and was named as the number three prospect and the "Most Exciting Player in the Carolina League" by Baseball America.', [10]', [11]',  In 1993, Ramirez was named "Minor League Player of the Year" by Baseball America while hitting .333 with 31 homers and 115 RBIs in 129 combined games with the Double-A ', Canton\u2013Akron Indians',  and Triple-A ', Charlotte Knights', .', [10]', [11]',

', Ramirez made his major league debut on September 2, 1993 against the ', Minnesota Twins', , going hitless in four ', at bats',  as the ', designated hitter', .', 
', The following day, when the Indians took on the ', New York Yankees', , Ramirez went 3 for 4 with his first two home runs, with many of his family and friends in attendance at ', Yankee Stadium', .', [1]', [12]',  His first career home run was hit against ', Mélido Pérez', .', [13]',  However, rather humorously, his first MLB hit off Perez was a ', ground rule double',  that bounced into the left field seats as left fielder ', u"Paul O'Neill", u" pursued it. Ramirez, seeing the ball in the seats, continued running thinking he had hit a home run, before returning to second base while his teammates ribbed him. After flying out to O'Neill in his next plate appearance, Ramirez homered in his final two at bats.", 
', In 1994, his first full season in the majors, Ramirez had a strong start to the season, hitting six home runs during the month of April.', [6]',  Despite a weak start to May, he rebounded in the latter half of the month, finishing the month with a .300 batting average.', [6]',  During the season, the Indians were chasing the ', Chicago White Sox',  for first place in the ', American League Central',  (AL Central) division all the way until the end of the season. However, the team fell short of qualifying for the playoffs and their season ended in August due to the ', 1994 MLB strike', .', [6]',  Ramirez finished second in the ', Rookie of the Year',  award voting after batting .269 with 17 home runs and 60 RBIs in 91 games.', [1]', 
', 1995\u20131997', [', edit', ]', 
', u"Ramirez's breakout season came in 1995, when he batted .308 with 31 home runs and 107 RBIs. In July, he was selected to his first ", All-Star Game',  and won his first career ', Silver Slugger Award',  following the season.', [1]',  That year, the Indians reached the postseason, and Ramirez hit two home runs in the ', 1995 American League Championship Series',  against the ', Mariners', , which the Indians won in six games. The Indians then took on the ', Atlanta Braves', u" in the World Series, and Ramirez batted .222 with one home run in the Indians' six-game loss.", [1]',  In December 1995, Ramirez agreed to a $10.15 million, four-year contract.', [14]', 
', u"Ramirez continued to hit well in 1996, batting .309 with 33 home runs and 112 RBIs. The Indians again reached the playoffs, and Ramirez batted .375 with 2 home runs in the Indians' loss to the Orioles in the ", 1996 American League Division Series', .', [1]', u" In 1997, Ramirez's contact continued to improve, though his power dipped slightly, as he hit .328 with 26 home runs and 88 RBIs. This year, the Indians again reached the ", World Series', , and Ramirez batted .154 with two home runs as the Indians lost to the ', Florida Marlins',  in seven games.', [1]', 
', 1998\u20132000', [', edit', ]', 
', In 1998, Ramirez experienced a great increase in power, on his way to becoming one of the great run producers in the game. He batted .294 with 45 home runs and 145 RBIs, and was selected to his second All-Star Game, where he recorded a ', sacrifice fly',  and RBI.', [15]',  Ramirez batted .357 with 2 home runs during the ', ALDS',  versus the Red Sox, which the Indians won in four games. In the ', ALCS',  against the Yankees, Ramirez batted .333 with two home runs, but the Indians lost in six games.', [1]',  Following the season, Ramirez came in sixth place in ', AL MVP',  voting.', [16]', 
', u"Ramirez began 1999 on a hot streak, hitting .337 with 7 home runs in the month of April. Ramirez's hot hitting continued all season, as he batted .364 in May and reached the All-Star break with 25 home runs and 96 RBIs.", [17]',  At the time, it was the third highest single season total for RBI by the All-Star Break in MLB history, behind only ', Hank Greenberg',  (103 in 1935) and ', Juan González', u" (101 in 1998). On September 30, 1999, Ramirez broke the Indians' single-season RBI record (previously 162 by ", Hal Trosky',  in 1936) by hitting a 3-run home run, giving Ramirez 164.', [18]',  He finished 1999 with 165 RBIs, the highest total by any player since ', Jimmie Foxx',  (1938), and batted an eye popping .383 against left handed pitchers. He also batted .383 with runners in scoring position, and .377 with men on base.', [1]',  That season, he finished third in the voting for the ', AL MVP',  award.', [19]',  However, he struggled in the 1999 postseason, going 1-for-18 as the Indians were eliminated by the ', Boston Red Sox',  in 5 games in the ', 1999 American League Division Series', .', 
', In 2000, Ramirez was limited to 118 games due to injuries, but recorded a career-high .351 batting average, along with 38 home runs and 122 RBIs.', [1]',  His return is believed to have started a major comeback that led the Indians to a final record of 90\u201372 and cut the number of games they were behind the leader of the AL Central, the ', Chicago White Sox', , from 11.5 games down to 7.5 games in just a month.', [20]',  Because of his return, ', Roberto Alomar', , ', Omar Vizquel', , and ', Kenny Lofton',  all started getting better pitches to hit, which also significantly increased their batting averages.', [20]',  Despite the comeback, the Indians failed to make the postseason, finishing 5 games behind the White Sox in the AL Central.', [21]',  With free agency looming, Ramirez homered in what would be his final game and at-bat in an Indians uniform, on October 1 against Toronto in front of the home fans at ', Jacobs Field', .',

Ramirez asking the first base umpire if he went around on a swing', 
', 
', 
', In November 2000, the Indians offered Ramirez a seven-year, $119 million contract. While this would have made Ramirez the highest-paid player in baseball, the deal was rejected by Ramirez and his agent, ', Jeff Moorad', , who were seeking a ten-year, $200 million contract.', [22]',  Ramirez was reportedly pursued by the New York Yankees and Seattle Mariners, but in December agreed to an eight-year, $160 million deal with the ', Boston Red Sox', , with $20 million options for 2009 and 2010, pushing the total value of the contract to $200 million for 10 years.', [23]', 
', Ramirez immediately delivered for the Red Sox, hitting .408 in April 2001. He had another sterling first half, amassing a .335 batting average with 26 home runs and 84 RBI at the 2001 All-Star break. However, he missed some time battling hamstring injuries and struggled down the stretch, finishing at .306 with 41 home runs and 125 RBI. On June 23, Ramirez hit two monstrous home runs against the ', Toronto Blue Jays',  at ', Fenway Park', , with the second one hitting the very top of the light tower in left field. Its length was officially listed at 501 feet,', [24]', u" second-longest by a Red Sox player in Fenway Park's history, just short of ", Ted Williams', u"' 1946 record of 502 feet.", [25]',  He also launched a prodigious home run in an away game on June 3 against the Blue Jays into the fifth deck at the ', SkyDome', u", which still stands as the longest home run in that ballpark's history at 491 feet. However, despite his efforts, the Red Sox did not qualify for the MLB postseason in 2001.", 
', Ramirez only played in 120 games in 2002 due to a hamstring injury that put him on the ', disabled list',  (DL) from mid-May to the end of June.', [6]',  Despite this, Ramirez won the AL batting title, hitting .349 (including .438 against lefties), and his .647 slugging percentage was second in the league behind ', Jim Thome', u"'s .677. Like clockwork, Ramirez again reached the 30 home run and 100 RBI plateaus, posting 33 and 107 respectively. He hit his 300th career home run on August 26 against the Angels' ", Ramón Ortiz', . It was the first of two home runs on the night for Ramirez, as he went 5-for-5 overall. However, the Red Sox again failed to qualify for the MLB postseason in 2002.', 
', In 2003, Ramirez again posted strong offensive numbers, finishing with a .325 average, 37 home runs, and 104 RBI. The second half surge of fellow Dominican slugger ', David Ortiz',  gave the Red Sox a formidable one-two punch in the middle of the lineup with Ramirez. However, in the summer, Ramirez missed several games with ', pharyngitis', ,', [6]',  but got into hot water as he was spotted in a bar in the hotel where he lived with a close friend, ', Yankees',  ', infielder',  ', Enrique Wilson', , despite being supposedly too ill to play in the series against the rival Yankees. Boston ', manager',  ', Grady Little',  benched Ramirez for one game as a result.', [26]',  Despite this distraction, the Red Sox finished the season 95-67, qualifying for the MLB postseason for the first time with Ramirez. In the decisive fifth game of their ', Division Series',  matchup against the ', Oakland Athletics', , Ramirez broke a 6th inning 1-1 tie by launching a go-ahead three-run homer off ', Barry Zito',  that set up an ALCS showdown with the rival Yankees. In ALCS Game 3, Ramirez was at the center of a bench-clearing brawl. Early in the game, Red Sox pitcher ', Pedro Martinez',  had hit Yankees outfielder ', Karim Garcia',  up high with a pitch, sparking heated dialogue, and a hard slide by Garcia into Red Sox second baseman ', Todd Walker',  had exacerbated the tensions. The very next inning, Yankees pitcher ', Roger Clemens', u" threw a pitch high and inside to Ramirez, and Manny charged the mound, sparking the melee. The Red Sox lost the game 4-3. Despite Ramirez's strong play in the ", ALCS',  against the Yankees (.310 with 2 home runs), the Red Sox fell to the Yankees in the decisive seventh game on ', Aaron Boone', u"'s infamous extra-inning, walk-off home run.", [27]', 
', During the offseason that followed, the new Red Sox ownership (led by ', John W. Henry', u") and management tried to rid themselves of Ramirez's massive contract, despite his high level of production to date. Believed to be necessary in pursuit of a trade for ", Texas Rangers',  shortstop ', Alex Rodriguez', , the team put Ramirez on irrevocable waivers, thus making him available to any team willing to assume the remainder of his contract. However, all 29 other teams passed on the opportunity to claim Ramirez due to the high cost,', [28]',  and Rodriguez was acquired by the Yankees instead, rather ironically as a replacement for Boone after the latter had blown out his knee playing offseason basketball.', 
', Also noteworthy from 2003 (though it would not be revealed until 2009), according to the ', New York Times', , Ramirez tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs that season from the "survey" drug test, in which MLB players were tested to see if drugs were being used. Players faced no penalties or sanctions for testing positive.', [29]',  Ramirez was one of 104 players to have allegedly tested positive.',

', In addition, Ramirez and teammate ', David Ortiz', u" became the first pair of AL teammates to hit 40 home runs, have 100 RBIs, and bat .300 since the Yankees' ", Babe Ruth',  and ', Lou Gehrig',  in 1931.', [30]',  Together they hit back-to-back home runs six times, tying the major league single-season mark set by the ', Detroit Tigers', u"' ", Hank Greenberg',  and ', Rudy York',  and later matched by the ', Chicago White Sox', u"'s ", Frank Thomas',  and ', Magglio Ordóñez', .', [30]', 
', In the ', 2004 Major League Baseball All-Star Game', , Ramirez hit a two-run home run off ', Roger Clemens',  in the top of the first inning, giving his teammates a 3\u20130 lead.', [31]',  Ramirez, ', Derek Jeter',  (with a ', single', ), ', Ichiro Suzuki',  (with a ', double', ) and ', Iván Rodríguez',  (with a ', triple', ) became the first All-Star quartet to ', hit for the cycle',  during the same inning.', [31]',  The Red Sox again qualified for the postseason, and Ramirez continued his hot hitting. He hit .385 in the ', 2004 ALDS', , leading the Red Sox to a sweep over the ', Anaheim Angels', , and setting up a rematch in the ', 2004 American League Championship Series',  against the Yankees. Despite not driving in a run in the ALCS, Ramirez hit .300 as the Red Sox completed a historic comeback from down 3 games to 0 to win in seven against the Yankees, setting up a showdown with the ', St. Louis Cardinals',  in the ', 2004 World Series', . Ramirez proceeded to hit .412 with a home run and 4 RBI in a 4-game sweep of the Cardinals, as the Red Sox won their first title since 1918. The home run came in the first inning of Game 3, off Cardinals starter ', Jeff Suppan', u", continuing a streak where the Red Sox scored in the first inning of each game in the series. Ramirez's 2004 season was capped off by being named ", World Series MVP', .', [31]', 
', 2005\u201306', [', edit', ]', 
', On May 15, 2005, Ramirez hit his 400th home run off ', Gil Meche',  of the ', Seattle Mariners', . On July 5, Ramirez hit his 20th career ', grand slam',  \u2014 and his third of the season \u2014 off ', Chris Young',  of the ', Texas Rangers', . On defense, however, he tied for the lead among all major league left fielders in errors, with 7.', [32]',  He posted his highest single season RBI total as a Red Sox in 2005, driving in 144 runs to go along with his 45 homers, but he batted "only" .292, his first time under .300 since 1998. Along with teammate ', David Ortiz', , who drove in 148 runs, the duo combined to drive in an outstanding 292 runs. Ortiz would finish second, and Ramirez fourth, in ', MVP',  voting to winner ', Alex Rodriguez', .', 
', Off the field, the season was one of much conflict for Ramirez.', [33]',  Persistent trade rumors (generally involving the ', New York Mets', ) dogged him all season.', [33]', u" After the Red Sox were eliminated in the first round of that year's playoffs by the eventual ", World Series',  champion ', Chicago White Sox', , Ramirez once again expressed a wish to be traded.', [34]',  This included a threat to not show up for ', spring training',  if his latest demand was not met by Red Sox GM ', Theo Epstein', .', [34]',  Toward this end, in December 2005, Ramirez put his ', Ritz-Carlton',  condominium up for sale.', [35]',  Trade rumors circulated with Ramirez possibly going to the ', Baltimore Orioles',  or the ', New York Mets', , but no deal was reached. By January 5, 2006, Ramirez changed his mind, stating that he was dropping the demand.', [36]',  His agents, in turn, insisted their client was still open to a trade.', [37]',  But no deal materialized.', 
', On June 10, 2006, Ramirez became the 31st player in history to hit 450 home runs, with a solo home run off ', Francisco Cordero',  of the Texas Rangers.', [', citation needed', ]',  Three weeks later, on July 1, he collected his 2000th ', hit', .', [38]',  Beginning in mid-July, he had a 28-game ', hitting streak', , including 12 multi-hit games, 8 HR, and 28 RBIs. He reached 100 RBI for the 9th consecutive season on August 20 in a series against the Yankees, but missed 28 games from mid-August on with soreness in his right knee.', [39]',  Ramirez finished at .321 with 35 home runs and 102 RBI.

Several minutes before the game, however, he informed manager ', Terry Francona', , through a bench coach, that he would not be playing. During the series Ramirez was directed to an area hospital for MRIs on both his knees; the results showed no damage.', [59]', u" When back in action, Ramirez frequently failed to run out ground balls. Assuming that this was due to his displeasure about his contract situation (Ramirez could become a free agent at season's end, but the Red Sox held 2 years of team options they had not yet exercised), many Red Sox fans and reporters, including ", Dan Shaughnessy',  of the ', Boston Globe', , called for Ramirez to be traded.', [60]',  Despite all these distractions, Ramirez did continue to hit solidly when on the field, as he batted .299 with 20 home runs and 68 RBI through the first 100 games of the season.',

', On July 31, 2008, Ramirez was traded to the ', Los Angeles Dodgers',  in a three-way deal. The Boston Red Sox acquired outfielder ', Jason Bay',  and minor league infielder ', Josh Wilson', , and the ', Pittsburgh Pirates',  got infielder ', Andy LaRoche',  and pitching prospect ', Bryan Morris',  from the Dodgers and outfielder ', Brandon Moss',  and pitcher ', Craig Hansen',  from the Red Sox.', [61]',  Ramirez had always worn ', uniform number',  24, but the Dodgers retired that number in honor of Hall of Fame ', manager',  ', Walter Alston', .

During the playoffs, Ramirez hit .520 with 4 home runs, 2 doubles, 11 walks and 10 RBIs.', [65]', 
', Ramirez was fourth in the voting for the 2008 NL MVP award, with 138 points, behind ', Albert Pujols', , ', Ryan Howard', , and ', Ryan Braun', ;', [66]',  this was remarkable for someone who played less than half a season in the NL. After the Dodgers lost in the playoffs, Ramirez, a free agent to be, was asked about his future. "Gas is up, and so am I", was his reply, indicating that he expected to be valued highly in the free agent market. After long and contentious negotiations that dragged into the start of spring training, Ramirez signed a two-year $45 million contract with the Dodgers on March 4.', [67]',

', After being placed on waivers by the Dodgers, Ramirez was claimed by the ', Chicago White Sox', u". The Dodgers awarded Ramirez to the White Sox on August 30, receiving no prospects, but with the White Sox assuming the $3.8 million remaining on Ramirez's salary.", [84]',  At the time, the White Sox hoped the pickup would bolster their offense for a playoff push. However, Ramirez hit .261 with just one home run and two RBI in his 24 games with the White Sox. He became a free agent at the conclusion of the season, which ended with the White Sox finishing 88-74, 6 games out of first place in the AL Central, and missing the postseason.',

', The signing initially looked like a bargain as Ramirez was among the better hitters in spring training, hitting .311 with 3 home runs and 10 RBI. However, the 38-year-old Ramirez abruptly retired on April 8, 2011, after batting .059 (1-for-17) in his first five games with no home runs and a single RBI.', [88]', u" Ramirez reportedly tested positive for a banned performance-enhancing drug in spring training. His first sample, or A sample, was retested and again returned a positive result.

', Reinstatement', [', edit', ]',

', Upon hearing that his plans to play in the winter league would not work, Ramirez decided that he was willing to serve his 100-game suspension for the second violation of the drug policy, and to request reinstatement with MLB. He stated that he was not prepared for retirement, that he would be available for any MLB team, and if none showed interest, then he would "play in Japan or some other place."', [93]', 
', On December 4, it was announced that Ramirez had formally filed papers with the league to be reinstated to baseball and that an agreement had been reached between MLB and the Players Association that Ramirez would need only to serve a 50-game suspension instead of the original 100.', [94]',

', 
', 
', Ramirez has often attracted attention on and off the field for his quirky behavior and attitude.', [114]',  These incidents are colloquially known as "Manny Moments" or more commonly, "Manny Being Manny".', [114]', [115]',  Instances of this behavior include inducing his Red Sox teammates, including ', Ellis Burks', , to drink alcohol which he had spiked with ', Viagra', ,', [116]',  wearing ', Oakley THUMP',  while playing the outfield,', [117]',  disappearing through a door in the Green Monster to use the bathroom, diving to intercept a throw from teammate ', Johnny Damon',  in the outfield which had been intended for the infield, selling his ', barbecue grill',  on ', eBay', , and high fiving a fan after a catch at the outfield wall before throwing the ball back to the infield to complete a double play.', [118]',  The first known documented usage of the phrase "Manny Being Manny" is attributed to then-Indians manager ', Mike Hargrove', , quoted in a 1995 ', Newsday',  article.', [119]', 
', Ramirez also built a reputation, despite his quirky behavior, of being someone who was a tireless worker at his hitting. He was known for long batting practice and tee sessions as well as constantly reviewing video of his swings and of opposing pitchers. However, while in the batters box during games, he kept his approach extremely simple, relying on the muscle memory and pitch recognition from his training regimen. He was known, at times, to verbally simplify his approach in the batters box to merely "seeing the ball".', [50]',
