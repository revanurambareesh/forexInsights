', William Mack Brown',  (born August 27, 1951) is a former American ', college football',  coach. He was most recently head football coach of the ', Texas Longhorns football',  team of the ', University of Texas at Austin', . He is currently a college football commentator for ', ESPN', .', 
', Prior to his head coach position at Texas, Brown was head coach at ', Appalachian State', , ', Tulane', , and ', North Carolina', . Brown is credited with revitalizing the Texas and North Carolina football programs. The Longhorns beat the ', University of Southern California',  in the 2006 ', Rose Bowl', , ', Ohio State',  at ', The Horseshoe',  in September 2005, and conference rival ', Oklahoma',  in 1998, 1999, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009, and 2013.

', Early life', [', edit', ]', 
', Brown was born as the middle of three children (brothers Mel and Watson) on August 27, 1951, in ', Cookeville, Tennessee', u". During his teenage years, he attended Putnam County High School. Brown's family had a long history with football. His grandfather, Eddie Watson, was an athlete at ", Tennessee Tech', u" and a coach at Putnam County High School for more than three decades. His father, Melvin Brown, was also a coach and an administrator. Mack's older brother ", Watson',  also coached, and was the head football coach at a total of six Division I football schools, ending his career with their hometown school, ', Tennessee Tech', .', [3]',  He attended ', Vanderbilt University',  before attending ', Florida State University',  and graduating in 1974. He later received a graduate degree from the ', University of Southern Mississippi',  in 1976. During his undergraduate years, Brown was a member of ', Sigma Alpha Epsilon',  fraternity.', [4]', 
', Playing career', [', edit', ]', 
', Mack Brown attended ', Vanderbilt University',  from 1969 to 1970. He played for Bill Pace at Vanderbilt, having 82 rushing attempts for 364 yards and 1 touchdown, as well as 7 catches for 50 yards and 1 touchdown for his career there.', [5]',  He later attended ', Florida State University', . Brown played for Florida State under head coach Larry Jones for the 1971\u20131972 seasons. At Florida State he had 31 rushing attempts for 98 yards and 10 catches for 76 yards with no touchdowns in the 1972 season.', [6]',  He started his coaching career as a student coach after a vicious hit in practice from Scott Meseroll prematurely ended his playing career.', 
', Coaching career', [', edit', ]', 
', Early positions', [', edit', ]', 
', u"Brown's first experience coaching came as a student coach of ", wide receivers',  at ', Florida State', , a position he held in 1973 and 1974. From 1975 to 1977 he was the wide receivers coach at ', Southern Miss', . This was followed by a one-year stint as wide receivers coach at ', Memphis State', .', 
', For the 1979 season, he joined the staff of ', Iowa State', , again as a wide receivers coach, before a promotion to ', offensive coordinator', . In 1980, after going 3\u20138 the year prior, Iowa State improved their record to 6\u20135 in large part due to ', running back', u" Dwayne Crutchfield (1,312 yards with 11 TD) and the rest of Brown's offense. The team scored 108 more points that year than they had in 1979. In 1981, despite finishing with a 5\u20135\u20131 record, the team started out with a record of 5\u20131\u20131. RB Dwayne Crutchfield was again a key focal point in Brown's offense and ran for 1,189 yards with 17 TD.", 
', In 1982, Brown moved to ', LSU',  as the ', quarterbacks', u" coach. The LSU Tigers improved their record to 8\u20133\u20131 from 3\u20137\u20131 the year prior in large part due to the Brown's coaching of ", quarterback',  ', Alan Risher', u", who threw for 1,834 yards with 17 TD and 8 INT. He also completed 63.7% of his pass attempts. Risher had thrown 14 TD in the previous two seasons combined before Brown's arrival.", 
', Appalachian State', [', edit', ]', 
', u"Brown's first head coaching job came in 1983 when he led ", Appalachian State',  to a 6\u20135 record. In December 1983, he was seriously considered for the head coaching position at ', LSU',  which had been vacated after ', Jerry Stovall',  was fired, but the position instead went to ', Miami Dolphins',  defensive coordinator ', Bill Arnsparger', .', 
', Oklahoma', [', edit', ]', 
', Brown moved back to a role as offensive coordinator for the ', Oklahoma Sooners',  during the ', 1984 season',  under head coach ', Barry Switzer', . Oklahoma would run for 2,376 yards as a team that season, averaging 216 yards a game. QB ', Danny Bradley',  also would throw for nearly 1,000 yards with 8 TD vs 5 INT. RBs ', Lydell Carr', , ', Steve Sewell', , and ', Spencer Tillman',  combined to run for 1,651 yards with 12 TD.', 
', Tulane', [', edit', ]', 
', u"Brown's second head coaching position came with ", Tulane', u" in 1985, where he also became the school's athletic director in the wake of a ", point shaving',  scandal which led to the shutdown of the ', u"men's basketball",  program. Despite a slow start (a 1\u201310 record in his first year), he made gradual improvement, leading the Green Wave to a 4\u20137 record in 1986 and, in 1987, to a 6\u20136 record and a trip to the ', Independence Bowl', u", Tulane's fifth bowl game in over 40 years.", 
', North Carolina', [', edit', ]', 
', In 1988, Brown took the head coaching job at ', North Carolina', u". Brown's first two teams finished with identical 1\u201310 records, the worst two seasons that the Tar Heels have suffered on the field in modern times. However, the next two years saw a relatively quick return to respectability. In 1990, the Tar Heels finished 6\u20134\u20131. By comparison, the Tar Heels had won only seven games in the previous three years. Included in the 1990 total was a tie of ", Georgia Tech', u" that proved to be the Yellow Jackets' only non-win ", that season',  en route to a share of the national championship. In 1991, the Tar Heels finished 7\u20134, narrowly missing a bowl bid.', 
', Everything finally came together for the Tar Heels in 1992. They finished 8\u20133 in the regular season and second in the ', Atlantic Coast Conference', , and with a victory over ', Mississippi State',  in the ', Peach Bowl', u", they finished the season at 9\u20133. The Peach Bowl was the program's first bowl appearance since 1986, first bowl win since 1982, and first appearance in a final Top 25 poll since 1982.", 
', u"The 1992 season was the start of UNC's most successful period since the ", Charlie Justice', u" era in the late 1940s. Brown coached the Tar Heels to five consecutive bowl games, including UNC's only two ", u"New Year's Day", u" bowl games in more than half a century (or three, if one counts the 1992\u201393 Peach Bowl, which was played the day after New Year's to avoid a conflict with the ", Sugar Bowl', ). They were ranked in the AP Top 25 every week from October 1992 through the start of the 1995 season. They finished in the final rankings in four out of five years, including two straight appearances in the top 10. They also won 10 regular-season games in 1993 and 1997, only the second and third times the Tar Heels have accomplished this. Largely due to ', Florida State', u" joining the league in 1992, Brown was unable to win an ACC title\u2014something the Tar Heels haven't done since 1980.", 
', u"Brown's time at UNC also saw renewed popularity for a team that had long played in the shadow of the school's powerhouse ", basketball team', . Games at ', Kenan Memorial Stadium',  were almost always sold out, the highlight being a ', standing-room only',  crowd of 62,000 that watched the Tar Heels play Florida State in 1997, still the largest crowd to watch a college football game on campus in the state of North Carolina. Brown also spearheaded a major renovation to Kenan Stadium that featured upgraded team facilities and an expansion to 60,000 seats.', 
', Not long after the end of the 1997 season, Brown accepted the head coaching job at Texas. His defensive coordinator, ', Carl Torbush', u", coached the Tar Heels in that year's ", Gator Bowl', . North Carolina credits the 1997 regular season to Brown and the Gator Bowl to Torbush. His 69 wins are the second-most in school history, behind only ', Dick Crum', .', 
', Texas', [', edit', ]', 
', Main article: ', Texas Longhorns football under Mack Brown', 
', In his early years at UT, Brown was referred to as "Coach February," due to his success in bringing in high talent recruits.', [7]',  His detractors felt that with all the resources at his disposal at Texas, combined with the talent he was recruiting from high school programs, that he should have more to show for it than appearances in the ', Holiday Bowl',  or ', Cotton Bowl Classic', . They felt that he should be playing for Big 12 titles or even ', National Championships',  instead.', 
', In five of the first seven seasons under Brown, the Longhorns were all but eliminated from either of these two goals due to losses in October to Big 12 rival ', Oklahoma', . Since the two teams played in the same division of the Big 12, a loss by Texas to Oklahoma meant that Texas could not win the south division of the conference unless Oklahoma lost at least two conference games. However, in 1999 Brown led Texas to their second Big 12 title game where they were beaten by a higher ranked ', Nebraska', u" team that they had beaten earlier in the year. In 2001, Brown took Texas to their 3rd Big 12 title game. In that year's campaign, the Longhorns lost to the ", Sooners', , but were given another chance when the Sooners lost to both ', Nebraska',  and ', Oklahoma State', . Texas lost the ', Big 12 Championship Game',  to ', Colorado', , a school they had beaten by a substantial margin earlier in the year. Many felt that Texas would have played in the ', BCS Championship game',  had they beaten Colorado. A similar opportunity presented itself in 2002. After Oklahoma beat Texas, they lost to ', Texas A&M',  and ', Oklahoma State', . However, Texas suffered a loss to ', Texas Tech', , so they did not make the championship game.', 
', In ', 2003', , Texas finished the regular season with a 10\u20132 regular season record, and most observers felt they had the resume to reach their first BCS bowl under Brown. However, when South Champion (and #1 ranked) ', Oklahoma',  lost to North Champion ', Kansas State', u" in the Big 12 championship game, Kansas State received the Big 12 Conference's automatic BCS bid as conference champion and joined Oklahoma in the BCS. The BCS rules specified that no more than two teams from a single conference could receive bids. Texas was frozen out.", 
', Although Brown consistently led the Longhorns to a bowl game to cap off each season in his first six years, he was not able to lead them to a ', Bowl Championship Series',  game, having to settle each year for the ', Holiday Bowl',  or ', Cotton Bowl Classic', . His record in these games was 3\u20133, with two of the three losses coming at the hands of supposedly inferior teams as judged by the rankings headed into the games.', 
', 2004 season', [', edit', ]', 
', Main article: ', 2004 Texas Longhorns football team', 
', In 2004, the Longhorns began the season with a #7 ranking nationally and had risen to #5 coming into the annual matchup with then #2 Oklahoma in the ', Red River Shootout', . Oklahoma shutout the Longhorns 12\u20130. Texas dropped to #9, before rebounding with wins over #24 ', Missouri', , 28\u201320, at #24 Texas Tech, 51\u201321, and at Colorado, 31\u20137. Then Texas set a record for the largest come from-behind-win in school history, beating #19 Oklahoma State, 56\u201335, after falling behind 35\u20137. After this performance, Texas again fell behind against ', Kansas', , but squeaked out a win 27\u201323. Kansas head coach ', Mark Mangino',  stirred up controversy by claiming that the officials were biased in favor of Texas because the conference wanted a second team in a BCS bowl game and Texas was in position to gain an at-large BCS bid. The series of victories brought Texas back up to #5 in the rankings as they welcomed arch-rival Texas A&M to Austin and won 26\u201313. However, ', Oklahoma',  stood undefeated, which meant the Sooners would represent the Big 12 South in the championship game against a much lower ranked team from the North Division. Once again, the loss to Oklahoma had kept Texas out of playing for a national or conference title, and had seemingly destined them to a non-BCS bowl as well.', 
', With Texas and ', California',  both vying for a spot in the ', Rose Bowl', , Brown received criticism for ', lobbying on behalf of his team', , which many perceived was a factor in UT's Rose Bowl invitation. Cal was denied what would have been their first Rose Bowl bid since 1958. "I thought it was a little classless how Coach Brown was begging for votes," Cal quarterback ', Aaron Rodgers',  told reporters in Berkeley. "I think a team's record and the way you play should speak for itself."', [8]', u" Cal's only loss was a 23\u201317 nailbiter on the road at USC. Cal dominated the game statistically, more than doubling USC in total yardage. The Golden Bears had a first-and-goal from the 9-yard-line with roughly one minute left in the fourth quarter, but could not convert. Meanwhile, Texas' lone loss was a 12\u20130 defeat to Oklahoma on a neutral field. USC and Oklahoma, the teams Cal and Texas lost to, respectively, went on to play in the national championship game. USC blew out Oklahoma 55\u201319 in that game. However, Texas fans point to the Holiday Bowl, where Cal was dealt a 45\u201331 loss at the hands of No. 23 Texas Tech, a team which Texas defeated 51\u201321 earlier in the season.", 
', u"Brown's Longhorns accepted the bid to play in the ", Rose Bowl', . It was the first visit by the Longhorns, due mainly to the fact that the Rose Bowl traditionally pitted the winner of the ', Pac-10',  against the winner of the ', Big Ten', u". Texas' opponent was ", Michigan', , whom Texas was playing for the very first time. Texas won the game, 38\u201337, on a last second field goal by kicker ', Dusty Mangum',  in what had been called one of the greatest Rose Bowl games of all time.', [9]', [10]', [11]', [12]', [13]', u" Despite the success of the 2004 season, Coach Brown's resume was still lacking both a conference championship and a national championship.",

The UT Tower lit in a special configuration in honor of the 2006 National Championship football team', 
', 
', 
', Texas opened the season ranked #2 behind USC in every preseason poll. Led by ', quarterback',  ', Vince Young', , Texas defeated their early opponents easily, including a decisive 45\u201312 victory over ', Oklahoma', . That marked the 6th time the Longhorns entered the contest ranked 2nd nationally, and they have won all six times. With the win, Texas started the season 5\u20130 for the first time since 1983. That season was the last time UT had national title hopes, when they ended the regular season 11\u20130 before losing to Georgia in the ', Cotton Bowl Classic', .', 
', After a win over previously undefeated Texas Tech, Texas moved into first place in the ', Bowl Championship Series',  (BCS) standings for the first time since its creation. However, the following week Texas fell back down to #2 in the BCS poll, while USC moved back into the #1 spot. Both teams won all their remaining games, with USC and Texas remaining ranked #1 and #2 throughout the rest of the regular season.', 
', The two teams finally met in the BCS National Championship Game at the ', 2006 Rose Bowl',  in a highly anticipated matchup. Texas and USC were the only two unbeaten ', NCAA',  ', Division I-A', u" (now FBS) teams, and the game marked the first time two teams averaging over 50 points per game had met. The combined 53-game win streak was an NCAA record for teams playing each other and the game was also the first to have teams ranked first and second in every iteration of the BCS standings. The game also featured USC's two ", Heisman',  winners (', Reggie Bush', , ', Matt Leinart', ) as well as a Heisman finalist in Vince Young. In an up and down game, Texas eventually defeated ', the Trojans',  41\u201338, highlighted by a 4th down game-winning touchdown run by ', Vince Young',  in the final minute. The win gave the Longhorns their first national championship in 35 years.', 
', 2006 season', [', edit', ]', 
', Main article: ', 2006 Texas Longhorns football team', 
', u"As the defending national champions, Texas began the season ranked #2 in the optimistic pre-season polls, having replaced the NFL-departed quarterback Vince Young with freshman Colt McCoy. The Longhorns however lost convincingly to #1 ranked Ohio State in the second game of the season in Austin. The Horns quickly rebounded to win seven straight games (including a second straight win over nemesis Oklahoma in the Red River Shootout) to climb into the Big 12 South driver's seat and entertain thoughts of a rematch with Ohio State in the national championship, but in the season's 10th game McCoy was injured and Texas was shocked on the road at Kansas State. After the loss, the Horns returned home still needing a final win to clinch the Big 12 South, and even though McCoy returned for the annual matchup Texas was again shocked, losing, 12\u20137, to intrastate rival Texas A&M. The loss snapped UT's six-game winning streak over the Aggies and the horns settled for the Alamo Bowl where Texas defeated a 6\u20136 Iowa team in a close game to cap off a 10 win season.", 
', 2007 season', [', edit', ]', 
', Main article: ', 2007 Texas Longhorns football team', 
', Mack Brown entered his 10th season as the head coach of the Texas Longhorns with a record of 93\u201322 setting a new mark above 0.8 winning percentage (.809), the best in Longhorn history. The ', 2007 Texas Longhorns football team',  began play ranked third in the all-time list of both total wins and winning percentage, and were ranked in the Top 10 by ', numerous pre-season polls', .', 
', Despite expectations, prior to and during the season a total of seven UT players were ', suspended for various infractions', .', [14]', [15]', [16]', [17]',  Brown said \u201cI am extremely disappointed that four of our student-athletes have had issues with the law this summer. That is not reflective of the high standard of class, character and integrity we have established at Texas for many years. It\u2019s a shame that these recent events have generated a great deal of negative attention, because I do think that overall, this is as good of a group of kids that I\u2019ve ever coached. I think that will show over time.\u201d', [16]',  The negative publicity was more extensive than in past instances but Mack Brown publicly supported the players while denouncing their actions.', 
', For the second straight year, UT merchandise were the top-selling products among buyers of ', Collegiate Licensing Company', .', [18]',  UT used part of the money to give Mack Brown a raise: the ', University of Texas Board of Regents',  voted unanimously to raise Brown's salary by $300,000, bringing his annual compensation to $2.81 million and keeping him among the five highest paid coaches in the sport. The package also contained provisions for up to $3 million in bonuses, including "$100,000 if he wins the Big 12 Championship and $450,000 if he wins this year's national championship, as well as bonuses based on the percent of players who graduate."', [19]', u" Brown's contract was extended through the 2016 season and includes buy-out clauses should another school attempt to hire Brown.", [19]', 
', For the football season, Texas won their first four games although three of them were closer than analysts had expected.', [20]', [21]', [22]', [23]', [24]',  In their next game Texas was beaten for a second year in a row by the Kansas State Wildcats 41\u201321 through play with no turnovers and 21  combined points from defense and special teams.', [25]',  The Kansas State Wildcats scored one touchdown on a punt return, one on a kick return, and one on an interception; Previously, Texas had never allowed all three types of scores in a single season.', [26]',  The 41 points were the most scored against Texas in Austin since UCLA handed the Longhorns a 66\u20133 loss in 1997,', [27]',  and it was the worst home defeat in the Mack Brown era at Texas.', [28]',  Texas lost again the following week in the 2007 ', Red River Shootout', , 28\u201321.', [29]',  With that loss, Texas opened conference play 0\u20132 for the first time since 1956, when they were in the ', Southwest Conference',  and one year before ', Darrell Royal',  became head coach of the Longhorns.', [29]',  But that was as bad as it got for Mack Brown during the first decade of the 21st century. In their ninth regular season game, Texas outscored ', Nebraska', u" 28\u201325, marking Brown's 100th win at Texas. In their next two games, the Longhorns would defeat ", Oklahoma State',  and ', Texas Tech', , but in their final matchup against archrival ', Texas A&M', u", the Longhorns lost 30\u201338. This marked the Longhorns' second straight loss to the Aggies. Despite the loss, Texas went to the ", Holiday Bowl',  to defeat 11th-ranked ', Arizona State',  52\u201334. The Longhorns finished the season 10\u20133, marking their seventh consecutive 10-win season, the third longest of all time in ', FBS',  history, trailing ', Florida State', u"'s 14 from 1987\u201300 and ", Miami', u"'s 8 from 1985\u201392.", [30]',

In ', a game',  played before a record-setting national television audience on November 1, 2008, the Longhorns, who trailed the entire game, took the lead with one minute and twenty-eight seconds remaining on the clock. Texas Tech then scored a comeback touchdown with one second remaining to win the game 39\u201333, ', keeping Texas out', u" of the Big 12 Championship Game and national title pictures. Texas finished the 2008 regular season with a win over Texas A&M, the Longhorns' longest-running rivalry opponent. The biggest margin of victory in the history of the series occurred when Texas beat A&M 48\u20130 in 1898.", [33]',  Texas nearly equaled that record in 2008 by producing a 49\u20139 victory, the second-largest margin of victory for this rivalry series. It was also the 200th career win for Mack Brown,', [33]',  and it set a new attendance record for UT, the State of Texas, the Big 12 Conference, and the southwest region. Texas would go on to win the 2009 Fiesta Bowl by beating Ohio State, 24\u201321.', 
', Final years', [', edit', ]', 
', In ', 2009', , Texas went undefeated in the regular season to win the Big 12 South Division. They defeated Nebraska in the Big 12 Championship Game to earn a berth in the national title game against ', Alabama', . QB Colt McCoy was injured early in the game and did not return, leaving the offense in the hands of inexperienced true freshman ', Garrett Gilbert', . ', Alabama',  was able to take advantage and won. Brown would coach the Longhorns for four more seasons. However, the teams would not match the success of the previous years. In ', 2010', u", the team had a losing record and did not play in a bowl game for the first and only time under Brown. On December 14, 2013, he announced his resignation as Texas' Head Coach effective following that ", u"season's",  bowl game.',

', u"In Austin, Mack and Sally continue to be active in community affairs, serving as honorary co-chairpersons of the Capital Campaign for the Helping Hands of Austin. They have also been instrumental in the opening of The Rise School of Austin (an early childhood education program that integrates children who have disabilities with their typically developing peers) and serve on the school's Board of Directors. They lent their name along with legendary UT QB ", James Street',  to the First Annual James Street/Mack Brown Golf Tournament benefiting The Rise School. The Browns have endorsed a new Texas license plate, which is designed to raise public awareness for ', child abuse',  and ', neglect', , and the need for Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) volunteers. After the ', Aggie Bonfire',  tragedy at ', Texas A&M',  in 1999, the couple initiated a blood drive on the UT campus that attracted more than 250 blood donors.', [40]',  Austin Mayor ', Lee Leffingwell',  pronounced January 30, 2014, "Mack and Sally Brown Day" in honor of the many contributions the Browns had made to the city of Austin during Mack's time as head coach of the Longhorns.', [41]', 
', In October 2006, Mack Brown made a cameo appearance in the ', television pilot',  for ', Friday Night Lights', . Early in the show, a resident is heard to say "Who does [', Coach Taylor', ] think he is? Mack Brown? He's no Mack Brown." Later in the pilot, the real Mack Brown plays the role of a local football booster quizzing high school coach Eric Taylor on his pre-game preparation.', [42]', [43]', [44]',  Brown also appears in commercials for ', College GameDay',  where he sings "', Texas Fight', " with the ', GameDay',  crew; when ', Kirk Herbstreit',  freestyles the song, Brown looks at Herbstreit sternly and says "We don't freestyle 'Texas Fight', big boy."', 
', Salary controversy', [', edit', ]', 
', u"In 2009 Brown's annual salary was increased to $5 million (excluding bonuses and incentives), a raise of about $2 million. The raise created controversy on the UT campus during a time when academic programs were facing significant cutbacks. On December 14, 2009, the UT faculty council held a special meeting to consider the following resolution:", [45]', 
', "We appreciate the contributions of the athletic staff and, especially, the student-athletes, to the community of the University of Texas at Austin. However, at a time when students are facing a deteriorating academic environment in the form of declining class offerings and increasing class sizes, and lecturers, teaching assistants, and staff are facing job terminations, we believe a permanent raise of $2 million (a sum greater than the entire career earnings of a typical university employee) offered to any member of the university community is unseemly and inappropriate."', 
', As of February 2014, Brown, with the title of Special Assistant, earned the highest salary of all employees of the state of Texas.', [46]',

', ^',  ', Cavil was suspended from the team prior to the bowl game in his junior year, for "violation of team rules". The nature of the violation was not specified by Brown, Cavil, or the university. It is uncertain if Cavil would have been welcomed back to the team for his senior season if he had not left early, but it was reported at the time that Brown says he never tells players what to do if they are considering entering the NFL draft early, implying that it was in fact an early departure for the draft. Cavil subsequently went undrafted. ', u"Texas' Cavil puts name into NFL hat",  ', Sports Illustrated',  January 7, 2000',

', William Mack Brown',  (born August 27, 1951) is a former American ', college football',  coach. He was most recently head football coach of the ', Texas Longhorns football',  team of the ', University of Texas at Austin', . He is currently a college football commentator for ', ESPN', .', 
', Prior to his head coach position at Texas, Brown was head coach at ', Appalachian State', , ', Tulane', , and ', North Carolina', . Brown is credited with revitalizing the Texas and North Carolina football programs. The Longhorns beat the ', University of Southern California',  in the 2006 ', Rose Bowl', , ', Ohio State',  at ', The Horseshoe',  in September 2005, and conference rival ', Oklahoma',  in 1998, 1999, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009, and 2013.

', Early life', [', edit', ]', 
', Brown was born as the middle of three children (brothers Mel and Watson) on August 27, 1951, in ', Cookeville, Tennessee', u". During his teenage years, he attended Putnam County High School. Brown's family had a long history with football. His grandfather, Eddie Watson, was an athlete at ", Tennessee Tech', u" and a coach at Putnam County High School for more than three decades. His father, Melvin Brown, was also a coach and an administrator. Mack's older brother ", Watson',  also coached, and was the head football coach at a total of six Division I football schools, ending his career with their hometown school, ', Tennessee Tech', .', [3]',  He attended ', Vanderbilt University',  before attending ', Florida State University',  and graduating in 1974. He later received a graduate degree from the ', University of Southern Mississippi',  in 1976. During his undergraduate years, Brown was a member of ', Sigma Alpha Epsilon',  fraternity.', [4]', 
', Playing career', [', edit', ]', 
', Mack Brown attended ', Vanderbilt University',  from 1969 to 1970. He played for Bill Pace at Vanderbilt, having 82 rushing attempts for 364 yards and 1 touchdown, as well as 7 catches for 50 yards and 1 touchdown for his career there.', [5]',  He later attended ', Florida State University', . Brown played for Florida State under head coach Larry Jones for the 1971\u20131972 seasons. At Florida State he had 31 rushing attempts for 98 yards and 10 catches for 76 yards with no touchdowns in the 1972 season.', [6]',  He started his coaching career as a student coach after a vicious hit in practice from Scott Meseroll prematurely ended his playing career.', 
', Coaching career', [', edit', ]', 
', Early positions', [', edit', ]', 
', u"Brown's first experience coaching came as a student coach of ", wide receivers',  at ', Florida State', , a position he held in 1973 and 1974. From 1975 to 1977 he was the wide receivers coach at ', Southern Miss', . This was followed by a one-year stint as wide receivers coach at ', Memphis State', .', 
', For the 1979 season, he joined the staff of ', Iowa State', , again as a wide receivers coach, before a promotion to ', offensive coordinator', . In 1980, after going 3\u20138 the year prior, Iowa State improved their record to 6\u20135 in large part due to ', running back', u" Dwayne Crutchfield (1,312 yards with 11 TD) and the rest of Brown's offense. The team scored 108 more points that year than they had in 1979. In 1981, despite finishing with a 5\u20135\u20131 record, the team started out with a record of 5\u20131\u20131. RB Dwayne Crutchfield was again a key focal point in Brown's offense and ran for 1,189 yards with 17 TD.", 
', In 1982, Brown moved to ', LSU',  as the ', quarterbacks', u" coach. The LSU Tigers improved their record to 8\u20133\u20131 from 3\u20137\u20131 the year prior in large part due to the Brown's coaching of ", quarterback',  ', Alan Risher', u", who threw for 1,834 yards with 17 TD and 8 INT. He also completed 63.7% of his pass attempts. Risher had thrown 14 TD in the previous two seasons combined before Brown's arrival.", 
', Appalachian State', [', edit', ]', 
', u"Brown's first head coaching job came in 1983 when he led ", Appalachian State',  to a 6\u20135 record. In December 1983, he was seriously considered for the head coaching position at ', LSU',  which had been vacated after ', Jerry Stovall',  was fired, but the position instead went to ', Miami Dolphins',  defensive coordinator ', Bill Arnsparger', .', 
', Oklahoma', [', edit', ]', 
', Brown moved back to a role as offensive coordinator for the ', Oklahoma Sooners',  during the ', 1984 season',  under head coach ', Barry Switzer', . Oklahoma would run for 2,376 yards as a team that season, averaging 216 yards a game. QB ', Danny Bradley',  also would throw for nearly 1,000 yards with 8 TD vs 5 INT. RBs ', Lydell Carr', , ', Steve Sewell', , and ', Spencer Tillman',  combined to run for 1,651 yards with 12 TD.', 
', Tulane', [', edit', ]', 
', u"Brown's second head coaching position came with ", Tulane', u" in 1985, where he also became the school's athletic director in the wake of a ", point shaving',  scandal which led to the shutdown of the ', u"men's basketball",  program. Despite a slow start (a 1\u201310 record in his first year), he made gradual improvement, leading the Green Wave to a 4\u20137 record in 1986 and, in 1987, to a 6\u20136 record and a trip to the ', Independence Bowl', u", Tulane's fifth bowl game in over 40 years.", 
', North Carolina', [', edit', ]', 
', In 1988, Brown took the head coaching job at ', North Carolina', u". Brown's first two teams finished with identical 1\u201310 records, the worst two seasons that the Tar Heels have suffered on the field in modern times. However, the next two years saw a relatively quick return to respectability. In 1990, the Tar Heels finished 6\u20134\u20131. By comparison, the Tar Heels had won only seven games in the previous three years. Included in the 1990 total was a tie of ", Georgia Tech', u" that proved to be the Yellow Jackets' only non-win ", that season',  en route to a share of the national championship. In 1991, the Tar Heels finished 7\u20134, narrowly missing a bowl bid.', 
', Everything finally came together for the Tar Heels in 1992. They finished 8\u20133 in the regular season and second in the ', Atlantic Coast Conference', , and with a victory over ', Mississippi State',  in the ', Peach Bowl', u", they finished the season at 9\u20133. The Peach Bowl was the program's first bowl appearance since 1986, first bowl win since 1982, and first appearance in a final Top 25 poll since 1982.", 
', u"The 1992 season was the start of UNC's most successful period since the ", Charlie Justice', u" era in the late 1940s. Brown coached the Tar Heels to five consecutive bowl games, including UNC's only two ", u"New Year's Day", u" bowl games in more than half a century (or three, if one counts the 1992\u201393 Peach Bowl, which was played the day after New Year's to avoid a conflict with the ", Sugar Bowl', ). They were ranked in the AP Top 25 every week from October 1992 through the start of the 1995 season. They finished in the final rankings in four out of five years, including two straight appearances in the top 10. They also won 10 regular-season games in 1993 and 1997, only the second and third times the Tar Heels have accomplished this. Largely due to ', Florida State', u" joining the league in 1992, Brown was unable to win an ACC title\u2014something the Tar Heels haven't done since 1980.", 
', u"Brown's time at UNC also saw renewed popularity for a team that had long played in the shadow of the school's powerhouse ", basketball team', . Games at ', Kenan Memorial Stadium',  were almost always sold out, the highlight being a ', standing-room only',  crowd of 62,000 that watched the Tar Heels play Florida State in 1997, still the largest crowd to watch a college football game on campus in the state of North Carolina. Brown also spearheaded a major renovation to Kenan Stadium that featured upgraded team facilities and an expansion to 60,000 seats.', 
', Not long after the end of the 1997 season, Brown accepted the head coaching job at Texas. His defensive coordinator, ', Carl Torbush', u", coached the Tar Heels in that year's ", Gator Bowl', . North Carolina credits the 1997 regular season to Brown and the Gator Bowl to Torbush. His 69 wins are the second-most in school history, behind only ', Dick Crum', .', 
', Texas', [', edit', ]', 
', Main article: ', Texas Longhorns football under Mack Brown', 
', In his early years at UT, Brown was referred to as "Coach February," due to his success in bringing in high talent recruits.', [7]',  His detractors felt that with all the resources at his disposal at Texas, combined with the talent he was recruiting from high school programs, that he should have more to show for it than appearances in the ', Holiday Bowl',  or ', Cotton Bowl Classic', . They felt that he should be playing for Big 12 titles or even ', National Championships',  instead.', 
', In five of the first seven seasons under Brown, the Longhorns were all but eliminated from either of these two goals due to losses in October to Big 12 rival ', Oklahoma', . Since the two teams played in the same division of the Big 12, a loss by Texas to Oklahoma meant that Texas could not win the south division of the conference unless Oklahoma lost at least two conference games. However, in 1999 Brown led Texas to their second Big 12 title game where they were beaten by a higher ranked ', Nebraska', u" team that they had beaten earlier in the year. In 2001, Brown took Texas to their 3rd Big 12 title game. In that year's campaign, the Longhorns lost to the ", Sooners', , but were given another chance when the Sooners lost to both ', Nebraska',  and ', Oklahoma State', . Texas lost the ', Big 12 Championship Game',  to ', Colorado', , a school they had beaten by a substantial margin earlier in the year. Many felt that Texas would have played in the ', BCS Championship game',  had they beaten Colorado. A similar opportunity presented itself in 2002. After Oklahoma beat Texas, they lost to ', Texas A&M',  and ', Oklahoma State', . However, Texas suffered a loss to ', Texas Tech', , so they did not make the championship game.', 
', In ', 2003', , Texas finished the regular season with a 10\u20132 regular season record, and most observers felt they had the resume to reach their first BCS bowl under Brown. However, when South Champion (and #1 ranked) ', Oklahoma',  lost to North Champion ', Kansas State', u" in the Big 12 championship game, Kansas State received the Big 12 Conference's automatic BCS bid as conference champion and joined Oklahoma in the BCS. The BCS rules specified that no more than two teams from a single conference could receive bids. Texas was frozen out.", 
', Although Brown consistently led the Longhorns to a bowl game to cap off each season in his first six years, he was not able to lead them to a ', Bowl Championship Series',  game, having to settle each year for the ', Holiday Bowl',  or ', Cotton Bowl Classic', . His record in these games was 3\u20133, with two of the three losses coming at the hands of supposedly inferior teams as judged by the rankings headed into the games.', 
', 2004 season', [', edit', ]', 
', Main article: ', 2004 Texas Longhorns football team', 
', In 2004, the Longhorns began the season with a #7 ranking nationally and had risen to #5 coming into the annual matchup with then #2 Oklahoma in the ', Red River Shootout', . Oklahoma shutout the Longhorns 12\u20130. Texas dropped to #9, before rebounding with wins over #24 ', Missouri', , 28\u201320, at #24 Texas Tech, 51\u201321, and at Colorado, 31\u20137. Then Texas set a record for the largest come from-behind-win in school history, beating #19 Oklahoma State, 56\u201335, after falling behind 35\u20137. After this performance, Texas again fell behind against ', Kansas', , but squeaked out a win 27\u201323. Kansas head coach ', Mark Mangino',  stirred up controversy by claiming that the officials were biased in favor of Texas because the conference wanted a second team in a BCS bowl game and Texas was in position to gain an at-large BCS bid. The series of victories brought Texas back up to #5 in the rankings as they welcomed arch-rival Texas A&M to Austin and won 26\u201313. However, ', Oklahoma',  stood undefeated, which meant the Sooners would represent the Big 12 South in the championship game against a much lower ranked team from the North Division. Once again, the loss to Oklahoma had kept Texas out of playing for a national or conference title, and had seemingly destined them to a non-BCS bowl as well.', 
', With Texas and ', California',  both vying for a spot in the ', Rose Bowl', , Brown received criticism for ', lobbying on behalf of his team', , which many perceived was a factor in UT's Rose Bowl invitation. Cal was denied what would have been their first Rose Bowl bid since 1958. "I thought it was a little classless how Coach Brown was begging for votes," Cal quarterback ', Aaron Rodgers',  told reporters in Berkeley. "I think a team's record and the way you play should speak for itself."', [8]', u" Cal's only loss was a 23\u201317 nailbiter on the road at USC. Cal dominated the game statistically, more than doubling USC in total yardage. The Golden Bears had a first-and-goal from the 9-yard-line with roughly one minute left in the fourth quarter, but could not convert. Meanwhile, Texas' lone loss was a 12\u20130 defeat to Oklahoma on a neutral field. USC and Oklahoma, the teams Cal and Texas lost to, respectively, went on to play in the national championship game. USC blew out Oklahoma 55\u201319 in that game. However, Texas fans point to the Holiday Bowl, where Cal was dealt a 45\u201331 loss at the hands of No. 23 Texas Tech, a team which Texas defeated 51\u201321 earlier in the season.", 
', u"Brown's Longhorns accepted the bid to play in the ", Rose Bowl', . It was the first visit by the Longhorns, due mainly to the fact that the Rose Bowl traditionally pitted the winner of the ', Pac-10',  against the winner of the ', Big Ten', u". Texas' opponent was ", Michigan', , whom Texas was playing for the very first time. Texas won the game, 38\u201337, on a last second field goal by kicker ', Dusty Mangum',  in what had been called one of the greatest Rose Bowl games of all time.', [9]', [10]', [11]', [12]', [13]', u" Despite the success of the 2004 season, Coach Brown's resume was still lacking both a conference championship and a national championship.", 
', 2005 season', [', edit', ]', 
', Main article: ', 2005 Texas Longhorns football team', 
', 
', 
', 
', 
The UT Tower lit in a special configuration in honor of the 2006 National Championship football team', 
', 
', 
', Texas opened the season ranked #2 behind USC in every preseason poll. Led by ', quarterback',  ', Vince Young', , Texas defeated their early opponents easily, including a decisive 45\u201312 victory over ', Oklahoma', . That marked the 6th time the Longhorns entered the contest ranked 2nd nationally, and they have won all six times. With the win, Texas started the season 5\u20130 for the first time since 1983. That season was the last time UT had national title hopes, when they ended the regular season 11\u20130 before losing to Georgia in the ', Cotton Bowl Classic', .', 
', After a win over previously undefeated Texas Tech, Texas moved into first place in the ', Bowl Championship Series',  (BCS) standings for the first time since its creation. However, the following week Texas fell back down to #2 in the BCS poll, while USC moved back into the #1 spot. Both teams won all their remaining games, with USC and Texas remaining ranked #1 and #2 throughout the rest of the regular season.', 
', The two teams finally met in the BCS National Championship Game at the ', 2006 Rose Bowl',  in a highly anticipated matchup. Texas and USC were the only two unbeaten ', NCAA',  ', Division I-A', u" (now FBS) teams, and the game marked the first time two teams averaging over 50 points per game had met. The combined 53-game win streak was an NCAA record for teams playing each other and the game was also the first to have teams ranked first and second in every iteration of the BCS standings. The game also featured USC's two ", Heisman',  winners (', Reggie Bush', , ', Matt Leinart', ) as well as a Heisman finalist in Vince Young. In an up and down game, Texas eventually defeated ', the Trojans',  41\u201338, highlighted by a 4th down game-winning touchdown run by ', Vince Young',  in the final minute. The win gave the Longhorns their first national championship in 35 years.', 
', 2006 season', [', edit', ]', 
', Main article: ', 2006 Texas Longhorns football team', 
', u"As the defending national champions, Texas began the season ranked #2 in the optimistic pre-season polls, having replaced the NFL-departed quarterback Vince Young with freshman Colt McCoy. The Longhorns however lost convincingly to #1 ranked Ohio State in the second game of the season in Austin. The Horns quickly rebounded to win seven straight games (including a second straight win over nemesis Oklahoma in the Red River Shootout) to climb into the Big 12 South driver's seat and entertain thoughts of a rematch with Ohio State in the national championship, but in the season's 10th game McCoy was injured and Texas was shocked on the road at Kansas State. After the loss, the Horns returned home still needing a final win to clinch the Big 12 South, and even though McCoy returned for the annual matchup Texas was again shocked, losing, 12\u20137, to intrastate rival Texas A&M. The loss snapped UT's six-game winning streak over the Aggies and the horns settled for the Alamo Bowl where Texas defeated a 6\u20136 Iowa team in a close game to cap off a 10 win season.", 
', 2007 season', [', edit', ]', 
', Main article: ', 2007 Texas Longhorns football team', 
', Mack Brown entered his 10th season as the head coach of the Texas Longhorns with a record of 93\u201322 setting a new mark above 0.8 winning percentage (.809), the best in Longhorn history. The ', 2007 Texas Longhorns football team',  began play ranked third in the all-time list of both total wins and winning percentage, and were ranked in the Top 10 by ', numerous pre-season polls', .', 
', Despite expectations, prior to and during the season a total of seven UT players were ', suspended for various infractions', .', [14]', [15]', [16]', [17]',  Brown said \u201cI am extremely disappointed that four of our student-athletes have had issues with the law this summer. That is not reflective of the high standard of class, character and integrity we have established at Texas for many years. It\u2019s a shame that these recent events have generated a great deal of negative attention, because I do think that overall, this is as good of a group of kids that I\u2019ve ever coached. I think that will show over time.\u201d', [16]',  The negative publicity was more extensive than in past instances but Mack Brown publicly supported the players while denouncing their actions.', 
', For the second straight year, UT merchandise were the top-selling products among buyers of ', Collegiate Licensing Company', .', [18]',  UT used part of the money to give Mack Brown a raise: the ', University of Texas Board of Regents',  voted unanimously to raise Brown's salary by $300,000, bringing his annual compensation to $2.81 million and keeping him among the five highest paid coaches in the sport. The package also contained provisions for up to $3 million in bonuses, including "$100,000 if he wins the Big 12 Championship and $450,000 if he wins this year's national championship, as well as bonuses based on the percent of players who graduate."', [19]', u" Brown's contract was extended through the 2016 season and includes buy-out clauses should another school attempt to hire Brown.", [19]', 
', For the football season, Texas won their first four games although three of them were closer than analysts had expected.', [20]', [21]', [22]', [23]', [24]',  In their next game Texas was beaten for a second year in a row by the Kansas State Wildcats 41\u201321 through play with no turnovers and 21  combined points from defense and special teams.', [25]',  The Kansas State Wildcats scored one touchdown on a punt return, one on a kick return, and one on an interception; Previously, Texas had never allowed all three types of scores in a single season.', [26]',  The 41 points were the most scored against Texas in Austin since UCLA handed the Longhorns a 66\u20133 loss in 1997,', [27]',  and it was the worst home defeat in the Mack Brown era at Texas.', [28]',  Texas lost again the following week in the 2007 ', Red River Shootout', , 28\u201321.', [29]',  With that loss, Texas opened conference play 0\u20132 for the first time since 1956, when they were in the ', Southwest Conference',  and one year before ', Darrell Royal',  became head coach of the Longhorns.', [29]',  But that was as bad as it got for Mack Brown during the first decade of the 21st century. In their ninth regular season game, Texas outscored ', Nebraska', u" 28\u201325, marking Brown's 100th win at Texas. In their next two games, the Longhorns would defeat ", Oklahoma State',  and ', Texas Tech', , but in their final matchup against archrival ', Texas A&M', u", the Longhorns lost 30\u201338. This marked the Longhorns' second straight loss to the Aggies. Despite the loss, Texas went to the ", Holiday Bowl',  to defeat 11th-ranked ', Arizona State',  52\u201334. The Longhorns finished the season 10\u20133, marking their seventh consecutive 10-win season, the third longest of all time in ', FBS',  history, trailing ', Florida State', u"'s 14 from 1987\u201300 and ", Miami', u"'s 8 from 1985\u201392.", [30]',

', The ', 2008 Texas Longhorns football team',  entered the season ranked 10th in the ', USA Today Coaches Poll', . They won their first four games to rise to number 5 in the national rankings. Texas began ', Big 12 Conference',  play on October 4, 2008 with a trip to ', Boulder, Colorado',  and a win over the ', Colorado Buffaloes', . On October 11, 2008 they defeated the number-one ranked ', Oklahoma Sooners',  in the ', 103rd Red River Shootout', u". It was the third UT win in four seasons, and the first time in Brown's tenure for either team to upset the other in the ", Red River Shootout', .', [31]', 
', Following the victory over OU, the Longhorns vaulted up the standings to first place in the AP, ESPN/USA Today, and Harris Polls. In their next game they secured a win over #11 Missouri in Austin, setting a new school, state, and conference attendance record in the process. It was the first time since 1977 for the Longhorns to play a home football game as the #1 team in the AP.', [32]', u" Texas' reign at the top of the BCS standings was soon brought to an end; however, by the then seventh-ranked ", Red Raiders of Texas Tech', . In ', a game',  played before a record-setting national television audience on November 1, 2008, the Longhorns, who trailed the entire game, took the lead with one minute and twenty-eight seconds remaining on the clock. Texas Tech then scored a comeback touchdown with one second remaining to win the game 39\u201333, ', keeping Texas out', u" of the Big 12 Championship Game and national title pictures. Texas finished the 2008 regular season with a win over Texas A&M, the Longhorns' longest-running rivalry opponent. The biggest margin of victory in the history of the series occurred when Texas beat A&M 48\u20130 in 1898.", [33]',  Texas nearly equaled that record in 2008 by producing a 49\u20139 victory, the second-largest margin of victory for this rivalry series. It was also the 200th career win for Mack Brown,', [33]',  and it set a new attendance record for UT, the State of Texas, the Big 12 Conference, and the southwest region. Texas would go on to win the 2009 Fiesta Bowl by beating Ohio State, 24\u201321.', 
', Final years', [', edit', ]', 
', In ', 2009', , Texas went undefeated in the regular season to win the Big 12 South Division. They defeated Nebraska in the Big 12 Championship Game to earn a berth in the national title game against ', Alabama', . QB Colt McCoy was injured early in the game and did not return, leaving the offense in the hands of inexperienced true freshman ', Garrett Gilbert', . ', Alabama',  was able to take advantage and won. Brown would coach the Longhorns for four more seasons. However, the teams would not match the success of the previous years. In ', 2010', u", the team had a losing record and did not play in a bowl game for the first and only time under Brown. On December 14, 2013, he announced his resignation as Texas' Head Coach effective following that ", u"season's",  bowl game.',

', u"In Austin, Mack and Sally continue to be active in community affairs, serving as honorary co-chairpersons of the Capital Campaign for the Helping Hands of Austin. They have also been instrumental in the opening of The Rise School of Austin (an early childhood education program that integrates children who have disabilities with their typically developing peers) and serve on the school's Board of Directors. They lent their name along with legendary UT QB ", James Street',  to the First Annual James Street/Mack Brown Golf Tournament benefiting The Rise School. The Browns have endorsed a new Texas license plate, which is designed to raise public awareness for ', child abuse',  and ', neglect', , and the need for Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) volunteers. After the ', Aggie Bonfire',  tragedy at ', Texas A&M',  in 1999, the couple initiated a blood drive on the UT campus that attracted more than 250 blood donors.', [40]',  Austin Mayor ', Lee Leffingwell',  pronounced January 30, 2014, "Mack and Sally Brown Day" in honor of the many contributions the Browns had made to the city of Austin during Mack's time as head coach of the Longhorns.', [41]', 
', In October 2006, Mack Brown made a cameo appearance in the ', television pilot',  for ', Friday Night Lights', . Early in the show, a resident is heard to say "Who does [', Coach Taylor', ] think he is? Mack Brown? He's no Mack Brown." Later in the pilot, the real Mack Brown plays the role of a local football booster quizzing high school coach Eric Taylor on his pre-game preparation.', [42]', [43]', [44]',  Brown also appears in commercials for ', College GameDay',  where he sings "', Texas Fight', " with the ', GameDay',  crew; when ', Kirk Herbstreit',  freestyles the song, Brown looks at Herbstreit sternly and says "We don't freestyle 'Texas Fight', big boy."', 
', Salary controversy', [', edit', ]', 
', u"In 2009 Brown's annual salary was increased to $5 million (excluding bonuses and incentives), a raise of about $2 million. The raise created controversy on the UT campus during a time when academic programs were facing significant cutbacks. On December 14, 2009, the UT faculty council held a special meeting to consider the following resolution:", [45]', 
', "We appreciate the contributions of the athletic staff and, especially, the student-athletes, to the community of the University of Texas at Austin. However, at a time when students are facing a deteriorating academic environment in the form of declining class offerings and increasing class sizes, and lecturers, teaching assistants, and staff are facing job terminations, we believe a permanent raise of $2 million (a sum greater than the entire career earnings of a typical university employee) offered to any member of the university community is unseemly and inappropriate."', 
', As of February 2014, Brown, with the title of Special Assistant, earned the highest salary of all employees of the state of Texas.', [46]',

', ^',  ', Cavil was suspended from the team prior to the bowl game in his junior year, for "violation of team rules". The nature of the violation was not specified by Brown, Cavil, or the university. It is uncertain if Cavil would have been welcomed back to the team for his senior season if he had not left early, but it was reported at the time that Brown says he never tells players what to do if they are considering entering the NFL draft early, implying that it was in fact an early departure for the draft.
