      ',  RSF is an Independent Australian owned feature film company producing 
        films for global theatrical/cinema release from its Gold Coast base here 
        in Queensland AUSTRALIA. The name "Rising Sun" was inspired by the Australian 
        Army rising sun emblem adopted at Australia's Federation in 1901. The 
        name is synonymous with the proud traditions established by the Defence 
        Forces and symbolic of the sacrifices made by all soldiers for their nation.

      ', RSF has been developing for some years the feature film ("KOKODA!") based 
        on the actual events and characters of a very famous Australian WWII campaign, 
        outlined further down. It is an exciting concept brought to you by the 
        Writer/Director of the mini-series ANZACS and Writer of the feature films 
        MAN FROM SNOWY RIVER I & II (John Dixon) and the Creator and Producer 
        of the documentary KOKODA-THE BLOODY TRACK, George Friend. 
      ',  "KOKODA!" is an action-adventure drama set in modern day PNG. It is 
        about the head to head clash of two veterans of the WWII campaign, who 
        find themselves on Kokoda once again, some 50 years later. 
      ', u" Their younger charges, an injured pilot and two reluctant locals accompany 
        them. The audience and our characters, are all taken on a roller coaster 
        journey over the old battleground. Confronted by nature's fury and demons 
        from the past, we have a cross cultural, cross generational conflict with 
        their environment, themselves and each other.

      ',  Kokoda: The Track and the History',  
      ',  Kokoda is the name of a Village at the foot of northern edge of the 
        Owen Stanley Ranges, Papua New Guinea (PNG). It is the start of a very 
        famous National Walking Trail crossing the Owen Stanley's on a North-South 
        lateral over some of the most difficult terrain in the world. It is known 
        as the "Kokoda Trail" and referred to often as "the track", which is colloquial 
        Australian for a rough or unformed path or road. 
      ', u" The trail is 90 kilometres in length between Kokoda and Ower's Corner, 
        just 42 kilometres north of Port Moresby (the capital of PNG). It ascends 
        up to nearly 3,000m (7,000ft) at its highest, plunging up and down, sometimes 
        1,000m to 2,000 m at a time, see-sawing its way over the mountain ranges. 
        Distance is measured in time rather than kilometres. 
      ",  Passing through high altitude rain forests, thick jungles, along knife 
        edge ridges down into dank, dark, morose creeks or crossing wide raging 
        torrents at the valley floors. Crossing these obstacles by either wet, 
        slippery and treacherous logs, fording them up to your neck in chilly 
        mountain waters or using temporary and rudimentary native bridges. 
      ',  The Kokoda walking trail, is a 2,000 year old communications path between 
        the villages over the mountains. This was also the battleground for one 
        of the most bitter and savagely contested campaigns of the South Pacific 
        in World War II (WWII). The Campaign was Officially referred to by the 
        War Nomenclatures Committee as the battle of the "Kokoda Trail", hence 
        the appearance of that name in Official records and on Regimental Banners 
        of units that fought there. 
      ', u" Just short of Ower's Corner is a village called Iorabaiwa (pronounced 
        ee-ora-bee-wa), this was the southern most point the Imperial Japanese 
        Army reached in their sweep through the South Pacific in 1942. 
      ",  It was on this unrelenting terrain and in oppressive jungle heat that 
        the two opposing forces clashed head to head from the 21 July till 3 November 
        1942 and provides the backdrop for the action and drama in the feature 
        film "KOKODA!".
