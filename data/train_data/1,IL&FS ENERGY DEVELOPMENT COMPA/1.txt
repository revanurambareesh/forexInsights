The objective was to develop, own and operate power generation and power transmission assets in India and abroad. In a span of five years IEDCL has successfully secured a number of power generation projects having diverse fuel linkages, such as gas, coal, hydro and bagasse ',     ', IEDCL has built considerable in-house expertise in various facets of project development and management such as technical, legal, regulatory, environment and financial',     ', The advisory services in project development and implementation are provided to State Governments, large Public Sector companies as well as Private Sector clients.  This has helped in establishing brand equity, providing priority access to state/central government and regulatory bodies and playing a very active role in formulation of various power sector policies',         ', The brief details of the generation capacities in various stages are as follows: ',     ', Presently around 1000 MW power generation capacities of IEDCL are in operation, 3,000 MW capacities are in various phases of implementation and around 10,000 MW capacities are in project development phase.  On the transmission side, around 250 Kms 400 KV D/C power transmission line is in operation, 410 Kms is under implementation and 145 Kms connecting Nepal and India is in the development phase. IEDCL expects to achieve a gross generation capacity of 14,000 MW by FY2019 ',
