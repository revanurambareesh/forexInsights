G.N. RAY, J.
',      Leave granted. Heard learned counsel for the parties.
     The short	question that  arises for  decision in	this
appeal is  whether the appellant which is government company
wholly owned  and controlled  by the  Central Government  is
excluded from the purview of the Kerala Construction Workers
Welfare Funds  Act 1989	 (Act  No.20  of  1989)	 hereinafter
referred to as the ', Welfare Funds Act', .
',      The appellant  company entered  into an  agreement	 for
construction of	 a stadium at Kaloor, Ernakulam, Kerala with
the respondent	No. 2  Greater Cochin Development Authority.
The terms  of the  contract inter  alia stipulated  that sub
contractors to	be employed  by the  appellant for execution
for the contract were to be approved by the respondent No.2.
The appellant  commenced work of construction of stadium and
from time to time engaged different contractors on a turnkey
basis.
',      The respondent  No.2 started  making deduction from the
part payment  of the  bills raised  by the  appellant at the
rate of	 1% of	the billed  amount for the works executed by
the appellant  on account  of contribution under the ', Welfare
Funds Act',   and the  schemes framed thereunder. The appellant
company protested  against such	 deduction by the respondent
No.2 by contending that the appellant being a company wholly
owned and  controlled by the Central Government did not come
within the purview of the ', Welfare Funds Act', .
',      For the purpose of appreciating rival contention of the
parties to  the	 appeal	 the  following	 provisions  of	 the
', Welfare Funds Act',  are set out here under:

     ', (Central Act',   I of	 1956)	for  any
     Board, Corporation or Society owned
     or controlled  by the Government of
     Kerala  and   includes  the  Kerala
     State Construction Corporation.

     grant which  shall not be less than
     ten per  cent of  the  Contribution
     initially made  by a  member of the
     Fund under sub-section (I).', 
', u"     The appellant  company's case  is	that  the  appellant
company is  wholly owned and controlled by the Government of
India. The  President of  India is  vested with the absolute
power to  appoint and remove the Directors. Each activity of
the company  is controlled  by the  Central Government.	 For
such deep  and pervasive control of the appellant company by
the central  government, the  appellant	 is  essentially  an
establishment or an institution of the Government of India.
",      It may  be stated here that several writ petitions were
filed in  the Kerala  High Court challenging the validity of
', Welfare Funds  Act',  and	by a common judgement dated 7.4.1993
passed by the Singly Bench of the Kerala High Court the said
writ petition  were disposed  of inter alia holding that (i)
', Section 2(g)',   and ', 8(2)', 	of the Welfare Funds Act and clauses
25 and	26 of the scheme framed under the Act are valid (ii)
', Section 9',   is ultravires  and void  (iii) contributions	 are
payable	  under ', Section	 8',  of  the welfare ', Funds Act',  only in
respect of works awarded as commenced after 7th August 1990.
',      The decision  was given  in the said judgment disposing
of writ	 petition directing  that  the	Board  shall  adjust
contribution received  from any	   of  the  said  petitioner
towards construction  for works	 awarded and commenced after
7th August  1990 and  refind the  excess is  any to the writ
petitioners.
', u"     According to  the	appellant  company,  the  said	writ
petitioners were  contractors  registered  with	 the  public
works department  of the State of Kerala and non of the said
writ petitioner was a company wholly owned and controlled by
the Government	of India  like the appellant company. Hence,
the  appellant	 company's  claim   for	 exemption  was	 not
available to  the other writ petitioners. When the claim for
exemption of  the appellant  company was  not acceded to the
appellant company  moved a  writ petition  before the Kerala
High Court.  Since the	decision of  the Single Bench of the
Kerala High  Court was	assailed in  Letter  Patent  Appeals
before the  Division Bench  of the  Kerala High Court by the
aggrieved writ	petitioners, the  writ petition filed by the
appellant company was heard and disposed of along with other
writ appeals  challenging the  validity of the ", Welfare Funds
Act',  and	 by a common judgment, the petition of the appellant
company was disposed of by considering the question of vires
of the Act without considering the claim of exemption by the
appellant company  being a  wholly owned and managed company
of the	Central	 Government.  The  appellant  then  filed  a
special leave  petition being SLP (Civil) No. 26450 of 1995.
By order  dated December  8, 1995 this court disposed of the
said  special  leave  petition	by  giving  liberty  to	 the
appellant company  to approach	the  Kerala  High  Court  by
filing a  review petition.  Such review	 petition being R.P.
No. 9 of 1996 in O.P.No. 11626 of 1994 has been dismissed by
the Kerala  High Court	by order  dated January 15, 1996 and
this appeal  is directed against such decision of the Kerala
High Court.
', u"     Mr.  Dipankar   Gupta,  the   learned  Senior   counsel
appearing for the appellant has contended that the appellant
company is  fully owned by the Central Government. The board
of management  of the  appellant company consists of persons
nominated by  the Central  Government.	There  is  deep	 and
pervasive control  of the  Central  Government	of  all	 the
activities of  the appellant  company. The appellant company
is not	only a	`State' within	the meaning of ", Article 12',  of
the Constitution  by fulfilling	 the criteria  laid down  by
this Court  is various	decision but  for  all	intents	 and
purposes,  the	 appellant   company   is   essentially	  an
undertaking or establishment of the Central Government.
', u"     Mr. Gupta	has contended that `construction work' under
", Section 2(c)',   of the  Welfare Funds  Act  does	not  include
construction work  under taken	by the	Government or any of
its establishment  or institution.  Hence, the	construction
work undertaken by the appellant company being establishment
or institution	of the	Central Government cannot be held to
be construction work under ', Section 2', [c] of the ', Welfare Funds
Act', . In support of his contention, Mr. Gupta has referred to
the Constitution  Bench decision of this Court in Ajay Hasia
and other  Vs. Khalid  Mujib Sehravardi and Other (1981) SCC
', 722. In	 the said  decision, it	 has been held by this Court
that the  court should	give such  an interpretation  to the
expression " other authorities" referred to in ', Article 12',  of
the Constitution  as will  not	stultify  the  operation  in
relation  to   the  fundamental	  rights  by   enabling	 the
government to  its obligation in relation to the fundamental
rights	by   setting  up   an  authority   to  act   as	 its
instrumentality or  agency for carrying its functions. Where
constitutional fundamentals,  vital to	the  maintenance  of
human right  are at stake, functional realism and not facial
cosmetics must	be diagnostic  tool, for  constitutional law
must seek  the substance  and not  the form.  This Court has
also indicated	that the  government  may  act	through	 its
instrumentality or  agency of  natural	persons	 or  it	 may
employ the  instrumentality or agency of judicial persons to
carry  out   its  functions.  It  has  been  held  that	 the
government, in	may of	its commercial	ventures and  public
enterprises, is	 resorting to  more and	 more frequently  to
this resourceful  legal contrivance of a corporation because
it has	many practical	advantage and  at the same time does
involve	 the  slightest	 diminution  in	 its  ownership	 and
control of  the undertaking.  In such, cases, the true owner
is the	State, the  real  operator  is	the  State  and	 the
effective controllorate	 is the State and accountability for
its actions  to the  community and  to Parliament  is of the
State. Even  then, the	corporation is	a distinct  juristic
entity with  a corporate  structure of	its own. It has also
been indicated	by this	 Court that  if a  corporation is an
instrumentality or  agency of  the government,	it  must  be
subjected  to	the  same   limitations	 in   the  field  of
constitutional law  as the  government itself, though in the
eye of	the law,  it would be distinct and independent legal
entity.
',      Mr. Gupta	has  submitted	that  this  Court  has	also
noticed that  in view of the inadequacy of the civil service
to deal	 with new  problems which  came to  the realised, it
became	necessary   to	forge	a  new	 instrumentality  or
administrative device for handing these new problems. It was
in  these  circumstance	 and  with  view  to  supplying	 the
administrative need that the "Corporation came into being as
the third  arm of  the government  and over  the year it has
been increasingly  utilised by the government for setting up
and running public enterprises and carrying out other public
functions."
', (Emphasis supplied)
     Mr. Gupta	therefore submitted  that it  will  be	only
appropriate to	accept the  appellant company as a third arm
of the	government being  an establishment of the government
for the purpose of exemption from the purview of the ', Welfare
Fund Act', .
',      In this  connection, Mr.  Gupta has  also	referred  to
another decision  of this Court in C.V. Raman Vs. Management
of Bank of India and another (1988 (3) SCC 105). In the said
case,  this  Court  has	 taken	into  consideration  of	 the
enforcement of	Tamil Nadu  Shops and ', Establishments Act',  and
similar acts  in other states to the State Bank of India and
the nationalised  banks.  It  has  been	 held  in  the	said
decision that  the State  Bank of India and the nationalised
banks are establishments under the central Government within
the meaning  of Clause	(a) of	Section 4(1)  of Tamil	Nadu
Shops and ', Establishments Act',  as well other parimateria Shops
and ', Establishment  Act', s in  other states.  In the said case,
the contention	of the	employees of  the banks was that the
banks being autonomous corporations having distinct juristic
entity with  a corporate  structure of	their own, cannot be
treated to  be owned  by  the  Central	Government  and	 the
expression "under  the Central Government" connotes complete
control	 in   the  sense  of  being  owned  by	the  Central
Government. Such  contention, however, has not been accepted
by this	 Court. The  contention that since ', Article 12',  of the
Constitution occurs  in Part III of the Constitution dealing
with the  fundamental rights,  the decisions  in  the  cases
dealing with  ', Article 12',   of the Constitution cannot be made
the basis  for contending  that the  State Bank of India and
the nationalised  banks are establishments under the Central
Government under  the Shops  and ', Establishment Act', , has also
not been accepted by this Court in C.V. Raman's case. It has
been  held  that  even	though	the  decisions	relating  to
instrumentality or  agency of  the government  were made  in
connection with	 the fundamental  right, but  in view of the
construction of	 the expression "State or other authorities"
under ', Article  12',  of the Constitution, it cannot be gainsaid
that the  salient principle which have been laid down in the
decisions dealing  with the  import of	', Article	 12',   of	 the
Constitution  with   regard  to	 the  authorities  having  a
corporate  structure  and  exercising  autonomy	 in  certain
spheres, will  certainly be  useful for	 determining  as  to
whether the  State Bank	 of India  and the nationalised bank
are establishments  under the  Central	Government  for	 the
purpose of enforceability of the Shop and ', Establishment Act', .
',      Mr. Gupta	has  submitted	that  the  position  of	 the
autonomous bodies  being instrumentalities  and agencies  of
the  government	  on  account  of  administrative  need	 and
functioning as	`third arm'  of the government as noticed in
Ajay Hasia's  case has	been relied  by this  Court in	C.V.
Raman's case.  Mr. Gupta  has contended	 that  it  has	been
indicated in  paragraph 12  of the  judgment in Raman's case
that if	 the criteria  laid down  in Ajay  Hasia's  case  as
quoted in  the decision,  is applied to the fact of the case
of C.V. Raman, it is obvious that even though the State Bank
of India and  the nationalised banks may not be owned by the
Central	 Government   and  its	employees  may	not  be	 the
employees of  the Central  Government, they  will  certainly
fall within the purview of the expression "under the Central
Government" in	view of	 the existence of deep and pervasive
control of the Central Government over these banks.
',      Mr. Gupta	has, therefore, submitted that the appellant
is essentially	a government  establishment for	 all intents
and purposes and therefore is entitled to get exemption from
the purview  of the  ', Welfare Funds  Act',  by treating it as an
establishment of the Central Government.
', u"     Such  contention	of  Mr.	 Gupta	has,  however,	been
disputed by Mr. R. Nariman, Senior Counsel appearing for the
respondent No.	2, Greater Cochin Development Authority. Mr.
Nariman has submitted that the decision in Ajay Hasia's case
was made in the context of preserving the fundamental rights
of the	citizen of  India vis-a-vis  the government  and its
departments and	 also the  agencies and instrumentalities of
the government	in respect  of which the government has deep
and pervasive  control. In the instant case, the question of
enforcement of fundamental rights is not involved. Moreover,
the ", Welfare  Funds Act', u"	is a  beneficial legislation enacted
for the	 purpose of  ensuring protection  and welfare of the
employees. Mr.	Nariman has  also  submitted  that  in	C.V.
Raman's case,  this Court  has	kept  in  view	the  welfare
measures and  in order	to ensure  welfare measures,  it has
held that the State Bank of India and nationalised banks are
establishment under  the Central Government for the purposes
of Shops  and ", Establishment  Act', . In  the instant  case, the
government Company  is trying  to get  out of the beneficial
measures under	the ', Welfare Funds Act',  which has been enacted
to protect  the interest  of the  labourers. Such beneficial
object under  the Act should not be allowed to be frustrated
by expanding the meaning of instrumentality or agency of the
Central Government  Mr. Nariman	 has further  submitted that
even if	 on account of any ambiguity two interpretations are
possible, the  one which will go to the benefit of labourers
must be	 accepted so  that the	purpose of  the Act  is	 not
frustrated Mr. Nariman has also submitted that the appellant
is a  public undertaking. Referring to Clause (c) of ', Section
2',  of  the Welfare  Fund Act,  Mr. Nariman has submitted that
the  expression	  "Construction	 Work"	 undertaken  by	 the
Government  of	 India	or  any	 of  its  establishments  or
institution  is	 very  significant.  Mr.  Nariman  has	also
submitted that	Clause (e) of ', Section 2',  of the Welfare Funds
Act defines  "Contractor" and  according to  the  definition
under Clause  (e) of  ', Section 2', , Contractor means any person
registered as  a contractor  for carrying  out	construction
work for  consideration for  a government  company  for	 any
State corporation  or society  made  by	 the  Government  of
Kerala and includes Kerala State Government Corporation. Mr.
Nariman has  submitted that  the legislature has intended to
include government company as a contractor in Clause (e) and
if  the	 legislature  has  intended  to	 exclude  government
Company or  public undertaking	for the	 purpose of  ', Section
2(e)', , there  would have	 been  specific	 exclusion  of	such
government company  but such  exclusion has deliberately not
been made  in Clause  2(e). Therefore, the appellant company
cannot claim exemption from the purview of the ', Welfare Funds
Act', .
',      Mr.  Sreekumar,   learned	counsel	 appearing  for	 the
respondent No.3,  namely, the  Construction Workers  for the
Welfare Board, has also disputed the contentions made by Mr.
Gupta Mr.  Kumar has  submitted	 that  the  appellant  is  a
government company and claim that being a government company
it should  get exemption from the enforcement of the ', Welfare
Funds Act', .  Mr. Kumar  has  submitted  that  the  government
Company has  been defined under ', Section 617',  of the Companies
Act. The  government company  means any company in which not
less that fifty one percent of paid share capital is held by
the Central  Governments and  includes a  company which is a
subsidiary of  the Government  Company. Hence, only with 51%
of paid up share capital belonging to the Central Government
or to  the State  Government or	 to both,  a company will be
held to	 be a  government company  even though	such company
cannot be  held to  be fully owned by the government. By the
definition of  government company  under the  ', Companies Act', ,
the government company need not necessarily be company fully
owned  by   the	 Government   and   by	 that	process	  an
instrumentality of the government. Hence, claim of exclusion
from   the purview  of the  Act simply on account of being a
government company  cannot be  accepted. Mr.  Kumar has also
supported the  contention  made	 by  Mr.  Nariman  that	 the
appellant Company  having undertaken the contractual work as
a commercial  venture  should  not  be	permitted  to  claim
exemption from	the purview of the ', Welfare Funds Act',  against
the interest of the poor labourer for whose benefit the said
Act has	 been enacted.	He has, therefore, submitted that no
interference is	 called for  by this  Court and	 the  appeal
should be dismissed.
', u"     After giving  our careful consideration to the facts of
the case  and the  respective contention made by the learned
counsel for the parties, it appears to us that the appellant
company cannot be held to be a department of the government.
There may  be deep  and pervasive  control of the government
over the  appellant company  and the  appellant company,  on
such account  may be  an instrumentality  or agency  of	 the
Central Government  and as such a `State' within the meaning
of ", Article 12', u" of the Constitution. Even though the appellant
company is  an agency  or  instrumentality  of	the  Central
Government,  it	 cannot	 be  held  to  be  a  department  or
establishment  of   the	 government   in  all	cases.	Such
instrumentality or agency has been held to be a third arm of
the government	in Ajay	 Hasia's case  but it  should not be
lost sight of that it was only in the context of enforcement
of fundamental	rights against	the action of government and
its instrumentalities  or agencies  it was  held  that	such
agencies were  the third  arm of  the  government  and	they
cannot avoid constitutional obligation. There is no question
of enforcing  any fundamental  right in the instant case. On
the contrary,  the question of protecting the welfare of the
employees vis-a-vis  the instrumentality  or agency  of	 the
Central Government under the ", Welfare Funds Act',  is to be kept
in mind	 for the purpose of deciding the rival contention of
the parties.  If clauses  2 [c] and [e] of the ', Welfare Funds
Act',  are	 taken into consideration, it will be quite apparent
that  the  legislature	has  not  intended  to	exclude	 the
government company  or the  statutory corporations  from the
purview of  the ', Welfare	 Funds Act', u".  The  decision  in	C.R.
Raman's case,  in our  view, is	 not an	 authority  for	 the
proposition that  an instrumentality or agency of government
is essentially	a government  department for all purpose and
such instrumentality or agency will enjoy the same privilege
and protection	which any government or its establishment or
department  enjoys   in	  relation   to	  a   statute.	 The
establishment of  a government	only connotes  in its  plain
meaning, an establishment directly run by the government and
not through the agency or instrumentality of the Government.
", The Welfare  Funds Act', 	is essentially an act to protect the
interest of  and welfare  of the labourers. Unless expressly
the instrumentality  or agency	of the	government  is	kept
outside the  purview of the said Act, it would not be proper
to interpret  the said	Act in	a wide amplitude by removing
the corporate  veil so as to exclude such instrumentality or
agency from the purview of the said Act.
',      We, therefore, do not find any reason to interfere with
the impugned  decision of  the Kerala  High Court  and	this
appeal, therefore,  fails and  is dismissed.  There will be,
however, no order as to cost.

G.N. RAY, J.
',      Leave granted. Heard learned counsel for the parties.
     The short	question that  arises for  decision in	this
appeal is  whether the appellant which is government company
wholly owned  and controlled  by the  Central Government  is
excluded from the purview of the Kerala Construction Workers
Welfare Funds  Act 1989	 (Act  No.20  of  1989)	 hereinafter
referred to as the ', Welfare Funds Act', .
',      The appellant  company entered  into an  agreement	 for
construction of	 a stadium at Kaloor, Ernakulam, Kerala with
the respondent	No. 2  Greater Cochin Development Authority.
The terms  of the  contract inter  alia stipulated  that sub
contractors to	be employed  by the  appellant for execution
for the contract were to be approved by the respondent No.2.
The appellant  commenced work of construction of stadium and
from time to time engaged different contractors on a turnkey
basis.
',      The respondent  No.2 started  making deduction from the
part payment  of the  bills raised  by the  appellant at the
rate of	 1% of	the billed  amount for the works executed by
the appellant  on account  of contribution under the ', Welfare
Funds Act',   and the  schemes framed thereunder. The appellant
company protested  against such	 deduction by the respondent
No.2 by contending that the appellant being a company wholly
owned and  controlled by the Central Government did not come
within the purview of the ', Welfare Funds Act', .
',      For the purpose of appreciating rival contention of the
parties to  the	 appeal	 the  following	 provisions  of	 the
', Welfare Funds Act',  are set out here under:
',      ', Section 2', .	 Definition  -	In  this
     Act, unless  the context  otherwise

     any local	authority  or  with  the
     Kerala Water  Authority or Devaswom

     Government Company as defined in',  S.
     617',   of   the  Companies  Act  1956
     ', (Central Act',   I of	 1956)	for  any
     Board, Corporation or Society owned
     or controlled  by the Government of
     Kerala  and   includes  the  Kerala
     State Construction Corporation.
',      (f) ......

',      (3) In case where the employer is a
     Contractor,    the	    contribution

     grant which  shall not be less than
     ten per  cent of  the  Contribution
     initially made  by a  member of the
     Fund under sub-section (I).', 
', u"     The appellant  company's case  is	that  the  appellant
company is  wholly owned and controlled by the Government of
India. The  President of  India is  vested with the absolute
power to  appoint and remove the Directors. Each activity of
the company  is controlled  by the  Central Government.	 For
such deep  and pervasive control of the appellant company by
the central  government, the  appellant	 is  essentially  an
establishment or an institution of the Government of India.
",      It may  be stated here that several writ petitions were
filed in  the Kerala  High Court challenging the validity of
', Welfare Funds  Act',  and	by a common judgement dated 7.4.1993
passed by the Singly Bench of the Kerala High Court the said
writ petition  were disposed  of inter alia holding that (i)
', Section 2(g)',   and ', 8(2)', 	of the Welfare Funds Act and clauses
25 and	26 of the scheme framed under the Act are valid (ii)
', Section 9',   is ultravires  and void  (iii) contributions	 are
payable	  under ', Section	 8',  of  the welfare ', Funds Act',  only in
respect of works awarded as commenced after 7th August 1990.
',      The decision  was given  in the said judgment disposing
of writ	 petition directing  that  the	Board  shall  adjust
contribution received  from any	   of  the  said  petitioner
towards construction  for works	 awarded and commenced after
7th August  1990 and  refind the  excess is  any to the writ
petitioners.
', u"     According to  the	appellant  company,  the  said	writ
petitioners were  contractors  registered  with	 the  public
works department  of the State of Kerala and non of the said
writ petitioner was a company wholly owned and controlled by
the Government	of India  like the appellant company. Hence,
the  appellant	 company's  claim   for	 exemption  was	 not
available to  the other writ petitioners. When the claim for
exemption of  the appellant  company was  not acceded to the
appellant company  moved a  writ petition  before the Kerala
High Court.  Since the	decision of  the Single Bench of the
Kerala High  Court was	assailed in  Letter  Patent  Appeals
before the  Division Bench  of the  Kerala High Court by the
aggrieved writ	petitioners, the  writ petition filed by the
appellant company was heard and disposed of along with other
writ appeals  challenging the  validity of the ", Welfare Funds
Act',  and	 by a common judgment, the petition of the appellant
company was disposed of by considering the question of vires
of the Act without considering the claim of exemption by the
appellant company  being a  wholly owned and managed company
of the	Central	 Government.  The  appellant  then  filed  a
special leave  petition being SLP (Civil) No. 26450 of 1995.
By order  dated December  8, 1995 this court disposed of the
said  special  leave  petition	by  giving  liberty  to	 the
appellant company  to approach	the  Kerala  High  Court  by
filing a  review petition.  Such review	 petition being R.P.
No. 9 of 1996 in O.P.No. 11626 of 1994 has been dismissed by
the Kerala  High Court	by order  dated January 15, 1996 and
this appeal  is directed against such decision of the Kerala
High Court.
', u"     Mr.  Dipankar   Gupta,  the   learned  Senior   counsel
appearing for the appellant has contended that the appellant
company is  fully owned by the Central Government. The board
of management  of the  appellant company consists of persons
nominated by  the Central  Government.	There  is  deep	 and
pervasive control  of the  Central  Government	of  all	 the
activities of  the appellant  company. The appellant company
is not	only a	`State' within	the meaning of ", Article 12',  of
the Constitution  by fulfilling	 the criteria  laid down  by
this Court  is various	decision but  for  all	intents	 and
purposes,  the	 appellant   company   is   essentially	  an
undertaking or establishment of the Central Government.
', u"     Mr. Gupta	has contended that `construction work' under
", Section 2(c)',   of the  Welfare Funds  Act  does	not  include
construction work  under taken	by the	Government or any of
its establishment  or institution.  Hence, the	construction
work undertaken by the appellant company being establishment
or institution	of the	Central Government cannot be held to
be construction work under ', Section 2', [c] of the ', Welfare Funds
Act', . In support of his contention, Mr. Gupta has referred to
the Constitution  Bench decision of this Court in Ajay Hasia
and other  Vs. Khalid  Mujib Sehravardi and Other (1981) SCC
', 722. In	 the said  decision, it	 has been held by this Court
that the  court should	give such  an interpretation  to the
expression " other authorities" referred to in ', Article 12',  of
the Constitution  as will  not	stultify  the  operation  in
relation  to   the  fundamental	  rights  by   enabling	 the
government to  its obligation in relation to the fundamental
rights	by   setting  up   an  authority   to  act   as	 its
instrumentality or  agency for carrying its functions. Where
constitutional fundamentals,  vital to	the  maintenance  of
human right  are at stake, functional realism and not facial
cosmetics must	be diagnostic  tool, for  constitutional law
must seek  the substance  and not  the form.  This Court has
also indicated	that the  government  may  act	through	 its
instrumentality or  agency of  natural	persons	 or  it	 may
employ the  instrumentality or agency of judicial persons to
carry  out   its  functions.  It  has  been  held  that	 the
government, in	may of	its commercial	ventures and  public
enterprises, is	 resorting to  more and	 more frequently  to
this resourceful  legal contrivance of a corporation because
it has	many practical	advantage and  at the same time does
involve	 the  slightest	 diminution  in	 its  ownership	 and
control of  the undertaking.  In such, cases, the true owner
is the	State, the  real  operator  is	the  State  and	 the
effective controllorate	 is the State and accountability for
its actions  to the  community and  to Parliament  is of the
State. Even  then, the	corporation is	a distinct  juristic
entity with  a corporate  structure of	its own. It has also
been indicated	by this	 Court that  if a  corporation is an
instrumentality or  agency of  the government,	it  must  be
subjected  to	the  same   limitations	 in   the  field  of
constitutional law  as the  government itself, though in the
eye of	the law,  it would be distinct and independent legal
entity.
',      Mr. Gupta	has  submitted	that  this  Court  has	also
noticed that  in view of the inadequacy of the civil service
to deal	 with new  problems which  came to  the realised, it
became	necessary   to	forge	a  new	 instrumentality  or
administrative device for handing these new problems. It was
in  these  circumstance	 and  with  view  to  supplying	 the
administrative need that the "Corporation came into being as
the third  arm of  the government  and over  the year it has
been increasingly  utilised by the government for setting up
and running public enterprises and carrying out other public
functions."
', (Emphasis supplied)
     Mr. Gupta	therefore submitted  that it  will  be	only
appropriate to	accept the  appellant company as a third arm
of the	government being  an establishment of the government
for the purpose of exemption from the purview of the ', Welfare
Fund Act', .
',      In this  connection, Mr.  Gupta has  also	referred  to
another decision  of this Court in C.V. Raman Vs. Management
of Bank of India and another (1988 (3) SCC 105). In the said
case,  this  Court  has	 taken	into  consideration  of	 the
enforcement of	Tamil Nadu  Shops and ', Establishments Act',  and
similar acts  in other states to the State Bank of India and
the nationalised  banks.  It  has  been	 held  in  the	said
decision that  the State  Bank of India and the nationalised
banks are establishments under the central Government within
the meaning  of Clause	(a) of	Section 4(1)  of Tamil	Nadu
Shops and ', Establishments Act',  as well other parimateria Shops
and ', Establishment  Act', s in  other states.  In the said case,
the contention	of the	employees of  the banks was that the
banks being autonomous corporations having distinct juristic
entity with  a corporate  structure of	their own, cannot be
treated to  be owned  by  the  Central	Government  and	 the
expression "under  the Central Government" connotes complete
control	 in   the  sense  of  being  owned  by	the  Central
Government. Such  contention, however, has not been accepted
by this	 Court. The  contention that since ', Article 12',  of the
Constitution occurs  in Part III of the Constitution dealing
with the  fundamental rights,  the decisions  in  the  cases
dealing with  ', Article 12',   of the Constitution cannot be made
the basis  for contending  that the  State Bank of India and
the nationalised  banks are establishments under the Central
Government under  the Shops  and ', Establishment Act', , has also
not been accepted by this Court in C.V. Raman's case. It has
been  held  that  even	though	the  decisions	relating  to
instrumentality or  agency of  the government  were made  in
connection with	 the fundamental  right, but  in view of the
construction of	 the expression "State or other authorities"
under ', Article  12',  of the Constitution, it cannot be gainsaid
that the  salient principle which have been laid down in the
decisions dealing  with the  import of	', Article	 12',   of	 the
Constitution  with   regard  to	 the  authorities  having  a
corporate  structure  and  exercising  autonomy	 in  certain
spheres, will  certainly be  useful for	 determining  as  to
whether the  State Bank	 of India  and the nationalised bank
are establishments  under the  Central	Government  for	 the
purpose of enforceability of the Shop and ', Establishment Act', .
',      Mr. Gupta	has  submitted	that  the  position  of	 the
autonomous bodies  being instrumentalities  and agencies  of
the  government	  on  account  of  administrative  need	 and
functioning as	`third arm'  of the government as noticed in
Ajay Hasia's  case has	been relied  by this  Court in	C.V.
Raman's case.  Mr. Gupta  has contended	 that  it  has	been
indicated in  paragraph 12  of the  judgment in Raman's case
that if	 the criteria  laid down  in Ajay  Hasia's  case  as
quoted in  the decision,  is applied to the fact of the case
of C.V. Raman, it is obvious that even though the State Bank
of India and  the nationalised banks may not be owned by the
Central	 Government   and  its	employees  may	not  be	 the
employees of  the Central  Government, they  will  certainly
fall within the purview of the expression "under the Central
Government" in	view of	 the existence of deep and pervasive
control of the Central Government over these banks.
',      Mr. Gupta	has, therefore, submitted that the appellant
is essentially	a government  establishment for	 all intents
and purposes and therefore is entitled to get exemption from
the purview  of the  ', Welfare Funds  Act',  by treating it as an
establishment of the Central Government.
', u"     Such  contention	of  Mr.	 Gupta	has,  however,	been
disputed by Mr. R. Nariman, Senior Counsel appearing for the
respondent No.	2, Greater Cochin Development Authority. Mr.
Nariman has submitted that the decision in Ajay Hasia's case
was made in the context of preserving the fundamental rights
of the	citizen of  India vis-a-vis  the government  and its
departments and	 also the  agencies and instrumentalities of
the government	in respect  of which the government has deep
and pervasive  control. In the instant case, the question of
enforcement of fundamental rights is not involved. Moreover,
the ", Welfare  Funds Act', u"	is a  beneficial legislation enacted
for the	 purpose of  ensuring protection  and welfare of the
employees. Mr.	Nariman has  also  submitted  that  in	C.V.
Raman's case,  this Court  has	kept  in  view	the  welfare
measures and  in order	to ensure  welfare measures,  it has
held that the State Bank of India and nationalised banks are
establishment under  the Central Government for the purposes
of Shops  and ", Establishment  Act', . In  the instant  case, the
government Company  is trying  to get  out of the beneficial
measures under	the ', Welfare Funds Act',  which has been enacted
to protect  the interest  of the  labourers. Such beneficial
object under  the Act should not be allowed to be frustrated
by expanding the meaning of instrumentality or agency of the
Central Government  Mr. Nariman	 has further  submitted that
even if	 on account of any ambiguity two interpretations are
possible, the  one which will go to the benefit of labourers
must be	 accepted so  that the	purpose of  the Act  is	 not
frustrated Mr. Nariman has also submitted that the appellant
is a  public undertaking. Referring to Clause (c) of ', Section
2',  of  the Welfare  Fund Act,  Mr. Nariman has submitted that
the  expression	  "Construction	 Work"	 undertaken  by	 the
Government  of	 India	or  any	 of  its  establishments  or
institution  is	 very  significant.  Mr.  Nariman  has	also
submitted that	Clause (e) of ', Section 2',  of the Welfare Funds
Act defines  "Contractor" and  according to  the  definition
under Clause  (e) of  ', Section 2', , Contractor means any person
registered as  a contractor  for carrying  out	construction
work for  consideration for  a government  company  for	 any
State corporation  or society  made  by	 the  Government  of
Kerala and includes Kerala State Government Corporation. Mr.
Nariman has  submitted that  the legislature has intended to
include government company as a contractor in Clause (e) and
if  the	 legislature  has  intended  to	 exclude  government
Company or  public undertaking	for the	 purpose of  ', Section
2(e)', , there  would have	 been  specific	 exclusion  of	such
government company  but such  exclusion has deliberately not
been made  in Clause  2(e). Therefore, the appellant company
cannot claim exemption from the purview of the ', Welfare Funds
Act', .
',      Mr.  Sreekumar,   learned	counsel	 appearing  for	 the
respondent No.3,  namely, the  Construction Workers  for the
Welfare Board, has also disputed the contentions made by Mr.
Gupta Mr.  Kumar has  submitted	 that  the  appellant  is  a
government company and claim that being a government company
it should  get exemption from the enforcement of the ', Welfare
Funds Act', .  Mr. Kumar  has  submitted  that  the  government
Company has  been defined under ', Section 617',  of the Companies
Act. The  government company  means any company in which not
less that fifty one percent of paid share capital is held by
the Central  Governments and  includes a  company which is a
subsidiary of  the Government  Company. Hence, only with 51%
of paid up share capital belonging to the Central Government
or to  the State  Government or	 to both,  a company will be
held to	 be a  government company  even though	such company
cannot be  held to  be fully owned by the government. By the
definition of  government company  under the  ', Companies Act', ,
the government company need not necessarily be company fully
owned  by   the	 Government   and   by	 that	process	  an
instrumentality of the government. Hence, claim of exclusion
from   the purview  of the  Act simply on account of being a
government company  cannot be  accepted. Mr.  Kumar has also
supported the  contention  made	 by  Mr.  Nariman  that	 the
appellant Company  having undertaken the contractual work as
a commercial  venture  should  not  be	permitted  to  claim
exemption from	the purview of the ', Welfare Funds Act',  against
the interest of the poor labourer for whose benefit the said
Act has	 been enacted.	He has, therefore, submitted that no
interference is	 called for  by this  Court and	 the  appeal
should be dismissed.
', u"     After giving  our careful consideration to the facts of
the case  and the  respective contention made by the learned
counsel for the parties, it appears to us that the appellant
company cannot be held to be a department of the government.
There may  be deep  and pervasive  control of the government
over the  appellant company  and the  appellant company,  on
such account  may be  an instrumentality  or agency  of	 the
Central Government  and as such a `State' within the meaning
of ", Article 12', u" of the Constitution. Even though the appellant
company is  an agency  or  instrumentality  of	the  Central
Government,  it	 cannot	 be  held  to  be  a  department  or
establishment  of   the	 government   in  all	cases.	Such
instrumentality or agency has been held to be a third arm of
the government	in Ajay	 Hasia's case  but it  should not be
lost sight of that it was only in the context of enforcement
of fundamental	rights against	the action of government and
its instrumentalities  or agencies  it was  held  that	such
agencies were  the third  arm of  the  government  and	they
cannot avoid constitutional obligation. There is no question
of enforcing  any fundamental  right in the instant case. On
the contrary,  the question of protecting the welfare of the
employees vis-a-vis  the instrumentality  or agency  of	 the
Central Government under the ", Welfare Funds Act',  is to be kept
in mind	 for the purpose of deciding the rival contention of
the parties.  If clauses  2 [c] and [e] of the ', Welfare Funds
Act',  are	 taken into consideration, it will be quite apparent
that  the  legislature	has  not  intended  to	exclude	 the
government company  or the  statutory corporations  from the
purview of  the ', Welfare	 Funds Act', u".  The  decision  in	C.R.
Raman's case,  in our  view, is	 not an	 authority  for	 the
proposition that  an instrumentality or agency of government
is essentially	a government  department for all purpose and
such instrumentality or agency will enjoy the same privilege
and protection	which any government or its establishment or
department  enjoys   in	  relation   to	  a   statute.	 The
establishment of  a government	only connotes  in its  plain
meaning, an establishment directly run by the government and
not through the agency or instrumentality of the Government.
", The Welfare  Funds Act', 	is essentially an act to protect the
interest of  and welfare  of the labourers. Unless expressly
the instrumentality  or agency	of the	government  is	kept
outside the  purview of the said Act, it would not be proper
to interpret  the said	Act in	a wide amplitude by removing
the corporate  veil so as to exclude such instrumentality or
agency from the purview of the said Act.
',      We, therefore, do not find any reason to interfere with
the impugned  decision of  the Kerala  High Court  and	this
appeal, therefore,  fails and  is dismissed.  There will be,
however, no order as to cost.
