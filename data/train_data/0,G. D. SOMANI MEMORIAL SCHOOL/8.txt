The next day, which is Holi is celebrated by people coming together and throwing coloured water and powder at each other. Delicacies such as Gujiya, Mathri and Malpua are distributed. All members of the family and even neighbours assemble in order to celebrate Holi. As a festival, Holi is open to all, as anyone can participate in the festivities. At the end of the day, the whole of Mumbai looks like a canvas that has been painted upon by many colours. During this festival we are taught to end all our bad habits.',

During this festival, idols of Ganpati are installed at homes and the entire family participates in prayers. The mantle on which the idol is kept is lavishly decorated. In Mumbai, Ganesh Chaturthi is celebrated with great vigour as the people form huge processions. During Ganesh Chaturthi relatives, friends and neighbours of all faiths come home and pay homage to the Ganesh idol. During this festival, we are taught to overcome all difficulties.',

', Diwali, or the festival of lights is celebrated in order to commemorate the victory of good over evil; the victory of light over darkness. The entire family along with their relatives come together in order to celebrate this festival. People celebrate Diwali by decorating their houses with earthen lamps called "Diyas". Beautiful firecrackers are burst all over Mumbai. People of all faiths join into the festivities. The value taught during this festival is that light over achieves victory over darkness. This is by far the entire group's favourite festival.',

', Difference In How We Celebrate Our Festivals and How Our Forefathers Celebrated Them', 

',

		', 
			', 
				', 
					
						

', The primary difference between how we celebrate our festivals and how our forefathers celebrated it is the fact that earlier families were joint and hence the entire family participated in the festivities but now, people live in nuclear families and hence the entire family may not be able to participate in the festivities. Another primary difference is that previously, people actually made sweetmeats and delicacies but now people buy it from markets. However people still celebrate festivals with the same pomp and vigour as they did generations ago.',

', Answering the main question, India is a country where people of different communities have been living together, in harmony for centuries. Therefore the festivals have also evolved in such a manner that people of all communities join the festivities.

The next day, which is Holi is celebrated by people coming together and throwing coloured water and powder at each other. Delicacies such as Gujiya, Mathri and Malpua are distributed. All members of the family and even neighbours assemble in order to celebrate Holi. As a festival, Holi is open to all, as anyone can participate in the festivities. At the end of the day, the whole of Mumbai looks like a canvas that has been painted upon by many colours. During this festival we are taught to end all our bad habits.',

During this festival, idols of Ganpati are installed at homes and the entire family participates in prayers. The mantle on which the idol is kept is lavishly decorated. In Mumbai, Ganesh Chaturthi is celebrated with great vigour as the people form huge processions. During Ganesh Chaturthi relatives, friends and neighbours of all faiths come home and pay homage to the Ganesh idol. During this festival, we are taught to overcome all difficulties.',

', Diwali, or the festival of lights is celebrated in order to commemorate the victory of good over evil; the victory of light over darkness. The entire family along with their relatives come together in order to celebrate this festival. People celebrate Diwali by decorating their houses with earthen lamps called "Diyas". Beautiful firecrackers are burst all over Mumbai. People of all faiths join into the festivities. The value taught during this festival is that light over achieves victory over darkness. This is by far the entire group's favourite festival.',

', Difference In How We Celebrate Our Festivals and How Our Forefathers Celebrated Them', 

',

				', 
					
						

', The primary difference between how we celebrate our festivals and how our forefathers celebrated it is the fact that earlier families were joint and hence the entire family participated in the festivities but now, people live in nuclear families and hence the entire family may not be able to participate in the festivities. Another primary difference is that previously, people actually made sweetmeats and delicacies but now people buy it from markets. However people still celebrate festivals with the same pomp and vigour as they did generations ago.',

', Answering the main question, India is a country where people of different communities have been living together, in harmony for centuries. Therefore the festivals have also evolved in such a manner that people of all communities join the festivities.
