', Long-lasting protection against degradation caused by light and heat', 
', Used in a wide number of industries, coatings not only provide countless items with color and texture, but also enhance their appearance and prolong their life.', 
', Light is one of the most important sources of damage to coatings. It triggers photo-oxidation, which typically results in discoloration, i.e., yellowing, or fading of colorants, for example in wall paints or inks. This ultimately leads to photo-degradation, causing additional surface defects, including loss of gloss, cracking and chalking.
  ', 
', Exposure of organic substrates to heat during processing steps, for example synthesis, mixing, extrusion and curing, or during high-temperature-baking cycles of coatings, also results in yellowing, as well as embrittlement and loss of mechanical properties such as tensile strength.', 
', Degradation can be counteracted through the use of suitable light stabilizers. UV absorbers (UVAs) provide protection against photo-oxidation and degradation by soaking up harmful UV rays and converting them into heat. Hindered amine light stabilizers (HALS) inhibit polymer degradation by neutralizing free radicals and regenerate themselves in the process, so they continue to provide protection throughout the life of the product. Primary and secondary antioxidants (AOs) help to prevent degradation caused by the effects of heat.', 
', In order to protect coatings against the harmful effects of light and heat, SONGWON offers a comprehensive range of high-value, high-performance coating stabilizers for numerous substrates, including steel, wood, ceramics, special composites, plastic films and plastic parts used in the inks, automotive and transportation, decorative and architectural, furniture and flooring, industrial and agricultural industries among others.',

', Fluorene type', 
', SONGWON Functional Monomers are used in all epoxy resins, epoxy resin composites and polycarbonates applications \u2013 for example skis, wind turbine foils, electronic components, eyewear, glass replacement, aerospace applications, cars, and many more.', 
', DCPD (dicyclopentadiene) type is mainly used as an epoxy resin modifier (ERM) in epoxy chain-extending reactions, primarily for the manufacture of epoxy composites.', 
', Bisphenol type is used in the manufacture of numerous plastics and epoxy resins. Applications for bisphenol-based plastic, which is clear and tough, include a variety of common consumer goods, such as water bottles, sports equipment, CDs, and DVDs. Epoxy resins containing bisphenols are used to line water pipes and coatings, and in the manufacture of thermal paper, such as that used in sales receipts.', 
', Fluorene type is highly suitable as components of a conducting polymer because they can stabilize and conduct a charge. The luminescent, electronic and absorptive properties of fluorene make it attractive for devices such as organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic solar cells, and organic thin-film sensors.',

', Long-lasting protection against degradation caused by light and heat', 
', Used in a wide number of industries, coatings not only provide countless items with color and texture, but also enhance their appearance and prolong their life.', 
', Light is one of the most important sources of damage to coatings. It triggers photo-oxidation, which typically results in discoloration, i.e., yellowing, or fading of colorants, for example in wall paints or inks. This ultimately leads to photo-degradation, causing additional surface defects, including loss of gloss, cracking and chalking.
  ', 
', Exposure of organic substrates to heat during processing steps, for example synthesis, mixing, extrusion and curing, or during high-temperature-baking cycles of coatings, also results in yellowing, as well as embrittlement and loss of mechanical properties such as tensile strength.', 
', Degradation can be counteracted through the use of suitable light stabilizers. UV absorbers (UVAs) provide protection against photo-oxidation and degradation by soaking up harmful UV rays and converting them into heat. Hindered amine light stabilizers (HALS) inhibit polymer degradation by neutralizing free radicals and regenerate themselves in the process, so they continue to provide protection throughout the life of the product. Primary and secondary antioxidants (AOs) help to prevent degradation caused by the effects of heat.', 
', In order to protect coatings against the harmful effects of light and heat, SONGWON offers a comprehensive range of high-value, high-performance coating stabilizers for numerous substrates, including steel, wood, ceramics, special composites, plastic films and plastic parts used in the inks, automotive and transportation, decorative and architectural, furniture and flooring, industrial and agricultural industries among others.',

', Fluorene type', 
', SONGWON Functional Monomers are used in all epoxy resins, epoxy resin composites and polycarbonates applications \u2013 for example skis, wind turbine foils, electronic components, eyewear, glass replacement, aerospace applications, cars, and many more.', 
', DCPD (dicyclopentadiene) type is mainly used as an epoxy resin modifier (ERM) in epoxy chain-extending reactions, primarily for the manufacture of epoxy composites.', 
', Bisphenol type is used in the manufacture of numerous plastics and epoxy resins. Applications for bisphenol-based plastic, which is clear and tough, include a variety of common consumer goods, such as water bottles, sports equipment, CDs, and DVDs. Epoxy resins containing bisphenols are used to line water pipes and coatings, and in the manufacture of thermal paper, such as that used in sales receipts.', 
', Fluorene type is highly suitable as components of a conducting polymer because they can stabilize and conduct a charge. The luminescent, electronic and absorptive properties of fluorene make it attractive for devices such as organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic solar cells, and organic thin-film sensors.',
