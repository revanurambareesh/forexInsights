The ', National Bureau of Animal Genetic Resources (NBAGR)',  has accorded the genetic recognition. With NBAGR conferring it genetically rare status, conserving these domesticated species would receive a boost.', 
', Key facts:', 
', 
', Kuji Mendha sheep are fast breeders giving multiple birth. Sheep in other parts of Odisha are not known for giving multiple birth. This characteristic makes them distinctive from other species.',

', Kendrapada sheep are primarily used for production of mutton. The other product of economic importance is their skin. They are well adapted to high ambient temperature, high humidity and heavy rains.', 
', 
', Background', :',

', Recent crisis:', 
', In December 2013, political infighting erupted into violence in the streets of the capital, Juba, after South Sudan\u2019s president accused his vice president of an attempted coup. Violence spread across the young nation like wildfire, displacing 413,000 civilians in just the first month of conflict. Tens of thousands of civilians rushed to seek refuge in U.N. bases that were subsequently turned into makeshift displacement camps. The fighting has continued, becoming increasingly brutal and affecting nearly the entire country.', 
', What\u2019s going on now?', 
', A handful of peace agreements have been signed over the course of the war \u2014 the most recent in August 2015 \u2014 but they have been repeatedly violated. The situation remains highly unstable. While some regions have recently become slightly less volatile, allowing people to move around fairly freely and return to their homes, violent outbreaks are still occurring throughout the country.',

', The ', Bornean orangutan',  (Pongo pygmaeus) is now critically endangered, with populations in sharp decline due to habitat destruction and illegal hunting. This was announced by the IUCN recently. Bornean orangutans live only on the ', island of Borneo', , where their populations have declined by 60% since 1950. New projections anticipate their numbers will fall another 22% by the year 2025 to an estimated 47,000 apes. The species, along with the Sumatran orangutan (critically endangered), belongs to the only genus of great apes native to Asia. The new IUCN findings suggest that hunting, habitat destruction, habitat degradation and fragmentation are the biggest drivers behind the population loss.',

            ', I think we have done this because of \u2013 1. To initiate good relations with African nations in terms of agriculture and then in future in terms of industries and services since their economy is still quite primitive. 2. Backup support for most imported agriculture crop that is pulses in case monsoon fails in India. 3. MSP issues in pulses in India force our farmers to go for cash crops or wheat/rice. 4. Diversification of import basket countries of pulses where we already have good tieup with Canada and ASEAN countries. 5. Above all, low exchange rate with India so hardly any problem of depletion of our forex reserves. ',

            ', It is quite obvious that the value of Indian National Rupee is higher than their (African) currency value hence our imports from these countries will be cheaper. Hence we will have to shell out less and can buy more. In another case, if these countries ask us to pay in US Dollars, we will still have to pay lesser as compared to advanced nations. This would mean low effect on our foreign exchange reserves.',

        ', 
            ', But we need to still pay in US Dollars. If the INR is strong against the Dollar, then that would mean more pulses import while paying less Dollars (ultimately less Rupees). Whatever the cost of production be for African countries for growing pulses, it does not matter us till their individual currency is very low in comparison to US Dollar and provided on the other hand our INR value is high using low oil  prices (low energy import bill) & low gold import (diverting consumption towards gold bond schemes).',

        ', 
        ', 
            ', No. It is rather the other way round. If INR is very low against dollar ie about 60 \u2013 70 etc. then foreign countries can buy more while paying less dollars. Exporters will enjoy high exports. This is the same strategy the Chinese use in order to keep their exports very cheap and competitive by consistently keeping the yuan undervalued just like Japanese yen. Secondly, if INR is strong against the dollar then it will mean cheap imports for us like oil. Foreign trips and imported expensive luxury items like perfumes will become more common than domestic ones. ', 
', Coming to pulses, we must not care what cost is incurred for the African nations. We should only care about what is advantageous for us. If we import from developed and industrialised countries like Canada then they will charge more as cost of labour and others expenses is high there  as compared to any poor African country whose first priority is exporting more and not labour costs n sundry expenses. So I say it is always better to import from them given that it will cost us less, say 1 tonne of tur dal at 500 Mozambique dollars and very costly from first world countries like Canada where 1 tonne of tur dal would cost say even 200 Canadian dollars. That\u2019s it. ',
