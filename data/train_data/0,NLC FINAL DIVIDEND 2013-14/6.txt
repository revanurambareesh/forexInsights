', Segment\u2013wise Performance', Mines',  ', Your Company is presently operating four lignite mines with a total capacity of 30.60 MTPA. During the year under review 1592.98 LM3 of Overburden was removed as against 1681.72 LM3 in 2013\u201314. The shortfall of 88.74 LM3 in 2014\u201315 over the previous year was on account of unscheduled stoppages of conveyor systems in overburden benches of Mine\u2013II for taking up vulcanising works and downtime of certain OB system BWEs of ', Mine\u2013IA due to mechanical breakdown.', The total Lignite production from all the mines during the year 2014\u201315 aggregated to 265.43 LT as against 266.09 LT during the previous year 2013\u201314. However the lignite requirements of Power Plants have been fully met with. ', The detailed Mine\u2013wise performance is as under : ', Mine\u2013I including Expansion \u2013 10.5 MTPA',  ', During the year 2014\u201315, Overburden removal was 624.19 LM3 as against 563.39 LM3 achieved during the previous year 2013\u201314 registering a growth of 10.79%.

Further, your Company has also so far installed nine Wind Turbine Generators of 1.50 MW each, aggregating to 13.50 MW, thereby increasing the overall power generating capacity to 3253.50 MW. ', During the year under review, 19729.13 MU of power was generated as against 19988.65 MU in the previous year 2013\u201314. The power generation would have been still higher but for the surrendering of power by the beneficiary States to the extent of about 93 MU. The average PLF for the Company as a whole was 81.36% as against the national average of 65.11%. The power export during the year was 16671.23 MU as against 16956.40 MU during the previous year 2013\u201314. The reason for shortfall in the generation and export as compared to the previous year was mainly on account of operation of units of Barsingsar TPS at lower load due to technical problems and that one Unit of TPS\u2013I (100 MW) was under stoppage between 20th May 2014 and 13th August 2014 due to dislodgement of HP heater shell affecting the generation. Further TPS\u2013I, one of the oldest power plant in the Country is serving for more than five decades and so could not be operated to the desired load due to ageing. ', The detailed Plant\u2013wise performance is as under: ', Thermal Power Station\u2013I \u2013 600 MW',  ', During the year 2014\u201315, the Power generation from this plant was 3631.05 MU as against 4058.14 MU during the previous year 2013\u201314 and 2876.12 MU of power was exported to Tamil Nadu power grid as against 3277.22 MU during the previous year 2013\u201314. During the year under review the Station achieved a PLF of 69.08%. Major Overhaul & Residual Life Assessment study works were carried out in Unit\u20131 & Unit\u20139. Annual maintenance works were carried out in all other units. As stated earlier, ageing of the Plant and shutdown of one Unit (100 MW) for a period of around three months had affected the generation during the year 2014\u201315. ', Thermal Power Station\u2013I Expansion \u2013 420 MW',  ', The Power generation from TPS\u2013I Expansion was 3385.03 MU during the year 2014\u201315 as against 3292.10 MU in 2013\u201314 registering a growth of 2.82%. The power exported during the year under review was 3107.25 MU as against 3013.59 MU during the previous year 2013\u201314 registering a growth of 3.11%.

The PBT and the PAT for the year ended 31st March, 2015 were the highest for any year since inception. ', The reason for increase in the profit for the year 2014\u201315 was on account of increase in sales consequent to truing up of lignite price for the period 2009\u201314 and accounting claim of wage revision arrears approved by CERC vide order dated 12.05.2015.', Dividend',  ', The Board of Directors of your Company has recommended a final dividend of 10% (Rs.1.00 per share) for the year 2014\u201315.
