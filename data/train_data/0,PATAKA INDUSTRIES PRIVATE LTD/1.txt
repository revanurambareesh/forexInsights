', Teachers of Al-Ameen', [', edit', ]', 
', Al-Ameen Mission has a good number of permanent teachers as well as visiting teachers from some reputed schools and colleges. The visiting teachers have shown passion of education beyond traditional teaching territories, as some them become long term associates of Al-Ameen to nurture the talents from the backward minorities. Of all the visiting teachers ', Prof. Mrinal Kanti Dowari',  known for being the authoring standard textbooks of higher secondary ', physics',  in ', west bengal',  remain an withstanding legacy to the Al-Ameen students. Despite most of the permanent teachers in Al-Ameen lacked what it takes to be an outstanding educator or orator during the golden age of Al-Ameen i.e. 2000 -2006(duration when the institution can be considered to have come of age), the dedication was notable regardless of their stature and meagre pay. And the students testimonials speaks out that loud. The success of Al-Ameen students is not just the success of the school but the enduring triumph of the devotion of the teachers to the most well known educational movement among bengali Muslims in recent times. However, there are few teachers which needs to be mentioned for the unequivocal support to the side of the students, be it educational, sentimental,inspirational or motivational. ', Dr. Mosarraf Hossain', , Amir Hossain, Harun Halder, Madat Ali, S.Zakaria, Syed Shaheed-ul Islam, KMZ et al. were the patrons. Many says has these teachers were not there, Al-Ameen would have been known a lot differently. And to a big extent Dr.Mosarraf Hossain can be safely assumed to be the role model of the students by popular judgement. Dr.Hossain and Syed Shaheed-ul Islam have left Al-Ameen shortly after 2006 to start new chapters of educational movement among bengali Muslims. Dr.Hossain and Syed Shaheed-ul Islam has started ', Educare Institution',  for grooming the dream of students in higher studies which is now grouped with ', AshSheefa Group',  founded by Dr.Hossain, Dr.Farukuddin Purkait, Farhad Ahmed, Nurul Amin, all Al-Ameen alumni.',
