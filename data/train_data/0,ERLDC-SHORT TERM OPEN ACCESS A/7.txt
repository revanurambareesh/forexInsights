', In this paper, in the background of evolution of power grids in India, establishment of regulatory framework and operational philosophy in vogue, first reliability aspect of long term, mid term as well as short term (operational / outage) planning has been dealt with. Thereafter issues on the day ahead scheduling of generation as associated with real time operation (linking frequency in particular) for implementation through unique real time pricing mechanism has been highlighted. It has been shown how effectively markets could take care of reliability with self-healing mechanism, particularly in a country like India having power shortages. At the same time important parameter like grid voltage too has figured in, although a lot more is expected in the time to come. Though immediately not tagged with pricing in the power market directly, finally grid security, restoration, mock trial for black start, etc. from reliability angle are the other pertinent aspects that have been touched to conclude. As such reliability coordination in every aspect is playing an important role right from load forecasting to system operation under the changing scenario with the development of power market in India.',

', IEEE Conference',

', S. Mukhopadhaya, R. Joshi', 
', With smart grid typically characterized by attributes like, reliable and secure, efficient and economic, environment friendly and safe to the extreme extent as feasible, it calls for quality transmission and distribution operation backed by generation with optimum utilization of assets considering expected level of commitment from all stakeholders. Latter encompass investors, owners, traders, service providers, operators, and consumers of different categories. Such being the concept plant operation and control assumes an important, but difficult task at every instant of time to go. With Indian grid still growing to meet demand along with expansion of network whether from new generation or strengthening intermediate power systems, stabilization of the process would definitely take some more years. But aspiration of consumers nevertheless is not going to stop from the point of view of quality, besides quantitative adequacy at every instant of time. This calls for on the one hand smart grid to adjust with generation and its possible storage with availability whenever and wherever called for, self-healing mechanism in the face of disturbance, optimum utilization of assets achieving high level of efficiency in operation, while at the other hand consumer getting quality electricity as per quantitative requirement, through successfully enabled provision of services, products marketed, etc. Extensive usage of digital technology in terms of communication and information technology on real-time basis is an essential feature for achieving success in the matter considering the demand-supply scenario accurately at every instant. Depending upon the same means of automatic or intelligent operation and control within smart grid concept has been deliberated in the paper.',

', The phase angle differences across different nodes are a measure of static stress across the grid and its proximity to instability and therefore can be monitored with respect to predetermined stability threshold limits. These threshold limits are being put based on the past experiences of system separation and off line simulations. The novel approach has improved system visualization and situational awareness of the system operators in the "NEW-grid." The paper describes the deployment of direct phase angle measurement for monitoring the security of a large grid and would be a precursor to the deployment of Synchrophasor technology in the Indian electric power systems.',

', Vineeta Agarwal, Suruchi Jain', 
', This paper describes the impact of System frequency on Reactive power. The discussion is based on the study of these two important parameters on generator, urban radial load and SVC. In Northern India wide variation in frequency, in the range of 48.5 - 50.2 Hz, is observed against the permissible limit of 49 - 50.5 Hz in the absence of free governor mode of operation (FGMO). Studies show that relation of Reactive power with respect to frequency is negative. One percent increase/decrease in frequency causes 6-12 % decrease/increase in Reactive power. To minimize this variation in Reactive power, for better Reactive power management, system stability and voltage control, a tighter frequency band is an urgent need today.',

', The National Electricity Policy (NEP) [1], issued by the Government of India, mandates transmission prices to be distance and direction sensitive and capture utilization of the network by each network user. In line with the mandate, the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) [2] has issued Sharing of Interstate Transmission Charges and Losses Regulations, 2010 [3], to introduce point of connection (PoC)-based transmission pricing methodology in India. The methodology under the above regulations introduces one of the major reforms of its kind in the Indian power sector and seeks to share the total transmission charges in proportion to respective utilization of the transmission system by different entities. In this paper, the authors have enumerated their experience gained from the implementation of PoC-based transmission pricing regime in India. Authors have also discussed various issues encountered in the process of implementation and the methodology adopted. Keywords: point of connection (PoC); transmission pricing; min-max fairness; marginal participation; average participation.',

', With more than 21,000 MW installed capacity of renewable energy sources as of now out of an estimated potential of about 189,000 MW, in the years to come it is really a challenge to integrate the same into the smart grids in a country like India. This is basically on account of unevenly distributed renewable resources. With 5 regional grids gradually getting connected, formation of national grid in totality is a reality. Of course with major sources of generation being thermal with availability up to certain distant future, entire thrust has been put in recent years on the development of renewable resources that would be the source of energy to run side by side to the conventional ones. At the same time vast assets created in transmission and distribution will also continue to be gainfully used, may be in conjunction other form of value addition to the same for proper functioning. Under this condition, keeping in mind the eventualities, regulations have been framed and so also the certification process has been made effective to handle the situation particularly on grid connectivity front. Expectations from smart grids by the consumers and suppliers as well of course may lead further refinement to the existing protocols in the process in the years to come as and when harnessing of renewable resources progresses to attain a very high level.',

', In India there are close to forty (40) Load Despatch Centres . In order to assess capabilities of these Load Despatch Centres (LDCs), a nationwide survey was conducted . It emphasizes that institutional capacity building of the LDCs in India is highly relevant in view of the ongoing reforms and restructuring, increasing vulnerabilities of the interconnected grid, rapid growth in the interconnection size, generation capacity addition, equipment/human failure, cyber attacks, environmental threats and fast changing regulatory framework in India. The paper argues that the effective coordination amongst the system operators can come by establishing functional and financial autonomy of the LDCs as well as by strengthening the capabilities of the human resource working in the LDC. The paper provides an overview of the recent initiatives being taken by the policy makers, regulators and the utilities in India for institutional capacity building of the LDCs. Most significant amongst these are the recommendations of the committee constituted by the Union Ministry of Power (MoP), Government of India (GoI) on manpower, certification, and incentives for system operation and ring fencing of LDCs; the report of the various task forces set up by the MoP for implementation of the recommendation of the committee; the Regulations on fees and charges of the LDCs notified by the Electricity Regulatory Commission; the formation of Forum of Load Despatchers (FOLD); the creation of ISO structure for operation of the National and Regional LDCs; and the programme for training and certification of power system operators in India being undertaken. It argues that institutional capacity building of the LDCs in India would be instrumental in synergizing the benefits of the various reform initiatives in the sector. The paper also highlights the various issues being faced in the implementation of the various initiatives and provides a future outlook.',

This robust framework facilitates Bangladesh to access any seller within India through open access. The Point of Connection (POC) mechanism for transmission charges and losses facilitates access to a competitive market. The NLDC India is also posting the transfer capability for power export from India to Bangladesh under various network conditions. Constraints that have arisen in transfer of full 500 MW to Bangladesh during certain hours of the day and certain seasons have been identified and addressed through network augmentation on the Indian side. In the interim period, System Protection Schemes (SPS) were put in place on either side to take care of any AC network depletion. The success story so far has spurred further interest in augmenting the 500 MW HVDC back to back station capacity from 500 MW to 1000 MW. Besides this, feasibility studies are also on for radial exchanges between North Eastern part of India and the Eastern part of Bangladesh.',

', The Indian electricity grid is among one of the largest power grids in the world, with an installed generating capacity of 259 GW as of February 2015. The Indian power sector started its consolidation and expansion in early 1990 with the establishment of a central utility, Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd. (PGCIL). India?s power system is managed by the five regional load dispatch centers (RLDCs), one for each regional power system. The implementation of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) and energy management systems (EMSs) took place from 2002 to 2006. The national load dispatch center (NLDC), which coordinates operations of the five RLDCs, started operations in 2009. Interconnections among the five Indian regional grids started in the early 1990s, and all regional grids have been synchronized since 31 December 2013. Currently, the five RLDCs and the NLDC are managed by the Power System Operation Corporation (POSOCO), a subsidiary of PGCIL. The Indian grid has been able to maintain a reasonable degree of stability over the years, despite the exponential expansion of loads and renewables integration.',

', In line with the mandate provided by the Indian Electricity Act 2003 and the ?ational Electricity Policy the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) has issued a number of Regulations to facilitate trading and introduction of competition in the Electricity Sector in the country. Open Access in inter-state transmission was introduced in May 2004 which facilitated the development of the bilateral market in the country. In order to further streamline the bilateral transactions and to facilitate the implementation of Power Exchange in India, CERC issued the Open Access Regulations 2008. These regulations provided for two categories of Short Term Open Access Transactions namely bilateral and collective (discovered on a power exchange). The paper presents salient features of Power Exchange implementation in India and the experience gained. Indian power grids are well meshed network and congestion occurs in some cases of skewed load generation balance. Congestion management techniques in a single exchange are discussed. Multiple Exchanges have been implemented in the country and sharing of available margins between the Exchanges becomes an issue of crucial importance with reference to achieving overall economy and efficiency. The paper discusses the various possibilities for sharing of the total available margins between the Power Exchanges and the Indian experience in this regard.',

', In this paper, in the background of evolution of power grids in India, establishment of regulatory framework and operational philosophy in vogue, first reliability aspect of long term, mid term as well as short term (operational / outage) planning has been dealt with. Thereafter issues on the day ahead scheduling of generation as associated with real time operation (linking frequency in particular) for implementation through unique real time pricing mechanism has been highlighted. It has been shown how effectively markets could take care of reliability with self-healing mechanism, particularly in a country like India having power shortages. At the same time important parameter like grid voltage too has figured in, although a lot more is expected in the time to come. Though immediately not tagged with pricing in the power market directly, finally grid security, restoration, mock trial for black start, etc. from reliability angle are the other pertinent aspects that have been touched to conclude. As such reliability coordination in every aspect is playing an important role right from load forecasting to system operation under the changing scenario with the development of power market in India.',

', Plant operation and control within smart grid concept: Indian approach', 
', IEEE Conference', 
', 2011', 
', S. Mukhopadhaya, R. Joshi', 
', With smart grid typically characterized by attributes like, reliable and secure, efficient and economic, environment friendly and safe to the extreme extent as feasible, it calls for quality transmission and distribution operation backed by generation with optimum utilization of assets considering expected level of commitment from all stakeholders. Latter encompass investors, owners, traders, service providers, operators, and consumers of different categories. Such being the concept plant operation and control assumes an important, but difficult task at every instant of time to go. With Indian grid still growing to meet demand along with expansion of network whether from new generation or strengthening intermediate power systems, stabilization of the process would definitely take some more years. But aspiration of consumers nevertheless is not going to stop from the point of view of quality, besides quantitative adequacy at every instant of time. This calls for on the one hand smart grid to adjust with generation and its possible storage with availability whenever and wherever called for, self-healing mechanism in the face of disturbance, optimum utilization of assets achieving high level of efficiency in operation, while at the other hand consumer getting quality electricity as per quantitative requirement, through successfully enabled provision of services, products marketed, etc. Extensive usage of digital technology in terms of communication and information technology on real-time basis is an essential feature for achieving success in the matter considering the demand-supply scenario accurately at every instant. Depending upon the same means of automatic or intelligent operation and control within smart grid concept has been deliberated in the paper.',

', Sunil Kumar, Vivek Pandey, Rajesh Kumar', 
', The phase angle differences across different nodes are a measure of static stress across the grid and its proximity to instability and therefore can be monitored with respect to predetermined stability threshold limits. These threshold limits are being put based on the past experiences of system separation and off line simulations. The novel approach has improved system visualization and situational awareness of the system operators in the "NEW-grid." The paper describes the deployment of direct phase angle measurement for monitoring the security of a large grid and would be a precursor to the deployment of Synchrophasor technology in the Indian electric power systems.',

', Reactive Power and System frequency Relationship - A case Study', 
', CBIP 7th International R&D Conference', 
', 2009', 
', Vineeta Agarwal, Suruchi Jain', 
', This paper describes the impact of System frequency on Reactive power. The discussion is based on the study of these two important parameters on generator, urban radial load and SVC. In Northern India wide variation in frequency, in the range of 48.5 - 50.2 Hz, is observed against the permissible limit of 49 - 50.5 Hz in the absence of free governor mode of operation (FGMO). Studies show that relation of Reactive power with respect to frequency is negative. One percent increase/decrease in frequency causes 6-12 % decrease/increase in Reactive power. To minimize this variation in Reactive power, for better Reactive power management, system stability and voltage control, a tighter frequency band is an urgent need today.',

', The National Electricity Policy (NEP) [1], issued by the Government of India, mandates transmission prices to be distance and direction sensitive and capture utilization of the network by each network user. In line with the mandate, the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) [2] has issued Sharing of Interstate Transmission Charges and Losses Regulations, 2010 [3], to introduce point of connection (PoC)-based transmission pricing methodology in India. The methodology under the above regulations introduces one of the major reforms of its kind in the Indian power sector and seeks to share the total transmission charges in proportion to respective utilization of the transmission system by different entities. In this paper, the authors have enumerated their experience gained from the implementation of PoC-based transmission pricing regime in India. Authors have also discussed various issues encountered in the process of implementation and the methodology adopted. Keywords: point of connection (PoC); transmission pricing; min-max fairness; marginal participation; average participation.',

', With more than 21,000 MW installed capacity of renewable energy sources as of now out of an estimated potential of about 189,000 MW, in the years to come it is really a challenge to integrate the same into the smart grids in a country like India. This is basically on account of unevenly distributed renewable resources. With 5 regional grids gradually getting connected, formation of national grid in totality is a reality. Of course with major sources of generation being thermal with availability up to certain distant future, entire thrust has been put in recent years on the development of renewable resources that would be the source of energy to run side by side to the conventional ones. At the same time vast assets created in transmission and distribution will also continue to be gainfully used, may be in conjunction other form of value addition to the same for proper functioning. Under this condition, keeping in mind the eventualities, regulations have been framed and so also the certification process has been made effective to handle the situation particularly on grid connectivity front. Expectations from smart grids by the consumers and suppliers as well of course may lead further refinement to the existing protocols in the process in the years to come as and when harnessing of renewable resources progresses to attain a very high level.',

', S.R. Narasimhan, Vivek Pandey, Lokesh Chnadra', 
', In India there are close to forty (40) Load Despatch Centres . In order to assess capabilities of these Load Despatch Centres (LDCs), a nationwide survey was conducted . It emphasizes that institutional capacity building of the LDCs in India is highly relevant in view of the ongoing reforms and restructuring, increasing vulnerabilities of the interconnected grid, rapid growth in the interconnection size, generation capacity addition, equipment/human failure, cyber attacks, environmental threats and fast changing regulatory framework in India. The paper argues that the effective coordination amongst the system operators can come by establishing functional and financial autonomy of the LDCs as well as by strengthening the capabilities of the human resource working in the LDC. The paper provides an overview of the recent initiatives being taken by the policy makers, regulators and the utilities in India for institutional capacity building of the LDCs. Most significant amongst these are the recommendations of the committee constituted by the Union Ministry of Power (MoP), Government of India (GoI) on manpower, certification, and incentives for system operation and ring fencing of LDCs; the report of the various task forces set up by the MoP for implementation of the recommendation of the committee; the Regulations on fees and charges of the LDCs notified by the Electricity Regulatory Commission; the formation of Forum of Load Despatchers (FOLD); the creation of ISO structure for operation of the National and Regional LDCs; and the programme for training and certification of power system operators in India being undertaken. It argues that institutional capacity building of the LDCs in India would be instrumental in synergizing the benefits of the various reform initiatives in the sector. The paper also highlights the various issues being faced in the implementation of the various initiatives and provides a future outlook.',

With accurate forecast by the Indian Meteorological Department, wide-scale damage to properties and loss of life could be prevented by timely massive evacuation. Adequate preventive measures were taken for the power supply system as a whole with the availability of online monitored data including those received from Phasor Measurement Units. Even deployment of large-scale portable Diesel-Generating sets on the power generation front and Emergency Restoration System for the transmission system helped to minimize supply disruption time and in post-super-cyclone period in coming back to normalcy',

', V.K. Agarwal, S.R. Narasimhan, Premendra Roy, Tapan Kumar Roy', 
', The paper describes the framework of scheduling, metering, accounting and imbalance settlement put into place which has facilitated the cross border exchange to a large extent. This robust framework facilitates Bangladesh to access any seller within India through open access. The Point of Connection (POC) mechanism for transmission charges and losses facilitates access to a competitive market. The NLDC India is also posting the transfer capability for power export from India to Bangladesh under various network conditions. Constraints that have arisen in transfer of full 500 MW to Bangladesh during certain hours of the day and certain seasons have been identified and addressed through network augmentation on the Indian side. In the interim period, System Protection Schemes (SPS) were put in place on either side to take care of any AC network depletion. The success story so far has spurred further interest in augmenting the 500 MW HVDC back to back station capacity from 500 MW to 1000 MW. Besides this, feasibility studies are also on for radial exchanges between North Eastern part of India and the Eastern part of Bangladesh.',

', The Indian electricity grid is among one of the largest power grids in the world, with an installed generating capacity of 259 GW as of February 2015. The Indian power sector started its consolidation and expansion in early 1990 with the establishment of a central utility, Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd. (PGCIL). India?s power system is managed by the five regional load dispatch centers (RLDCs), one for each regional power system. The implementation of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) and energy management systems (EMSs) took place from 2002 to 2006. The national load dispatch center (NLDC), which coordinates operations of the five RLDCs, started operations in 2009. Interconnections among the five Indian regional grids started in the early 1990s, and all regional grids have been synchronized since 31 December 2013. Currently, the five RLDCs and the NLDC are managed by the Power System Operation Corporation (POSOCO), a subsidiary of PGCIL. The Indian grid has been able to maintain a reasonable degree of stability over the years, despite the exponential expansion of loads and renewables integration.',

', In line with the mandate provided by the Indian Electricity Act 2003 and the ?ational Electricity Policy the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) has issued a number of Regulations to facilitate trading and introduction of competition in the Electricity Sector in the country. Open Access in inter-state transmission was introduced in May 2004 which facilitated the development of the bilateral market in the country. In order to further streamline the bilateral transactions and to facilitate the implementation of Power Exchange in India, CERC issued the Open Access Regulations 2008. These regulations provided for two categories of Short Term Open Access Transactions namely bilateral and collective (discovered on a power exchange). The paper presents salient features of Power Exchange implementation in India and the experience gained. Indian power grids are well meshed network and congestion occurs in some cases of skewed load generation balance. Congestion management techniques in a single exchange are discussed. Multiple Exchanges have been implemented in the country and sharing of available margins between the Exchanges becomes an issue of crucial importance with reference to achieving overall economy and efficiency. The paper discusses the various possibilities for sharing of the total available margins between the Power Exchanges and the Indian experience in this regard.',
