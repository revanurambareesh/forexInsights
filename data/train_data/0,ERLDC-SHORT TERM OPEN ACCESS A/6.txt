    The Power System in India is organized in five electrical regions for operational and
planning purpose namely North, South, East, West and North-east. Eastern
Region with an installed generating capacity of 28337.75 MW (as on 12.10.2012) is
connected with all four regions of the country. It is also electrically connected with
Bhutan and Nepal.
Eastern Region constituents include mainly five states, Damodar Valley Corporation,
Central Sector Generating Stations (NTPC and NHPC) and one Central
Transmission Utility (CTU). Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) is a vertically
integrated utility like a SEB and has its own Generation, Transmission and
Distribution in the identified command area of Jharkhand and West Bengal. DVC
has a separate Control Center at Maithon. A few interstate lines between
Jharkhand and West Bengal that form a part of the Inter State Transmission System
are also operated and maintained by the DVC.
Presently all the regions are synchronized electrically as single block. The
Exchange of power among the synchronized regions takes place through
765/400/220KV transmission lines and 800/1200KV HVDC interconnections
whereas the power Exchange with Southern Region is through HVDC
interconnections. In each Region, the Generation, Transmission and Distribution of
Power along with State Lines is organized such that the State owned Power
Systems and Load Despatch Centers are operated by State Transmission
Companies. The State Transmission Companies and the Central Sector Group of
agencies are referred to as Constituents. The operation of the each Regional Grid is
managed by the Regional Load Despatch enter (RLDC) with underlying State Load
Despatch Center (SLDCs) and Sub-LDCs. At National level to supervise the RLDCs
and to monitor the Inter Regional Power Exchanges, a National Load Despatch

    POWER SYSTEM OPERATION CORPORATION LIMITED
Introduction \u2013 Formation of POSOCO:
Power System Operation Corporation Limited (POSOCO) is a
wholly owned subsidiary of Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (PGCIL). It was
formed in March 2010 to handle the power management functions of PGCIL. It is
responsible to ensure the integrated operation of the Grid in a reliable, efficient and
secure manner. It consists of 5 Regional Load despatch Centers and a National
Load Despatch Center (NLDC). The subsidiary may eventually be made a separate
company, leaving the parent firm with only the task of setting up transmission links.
The load despatch functions, earlier handled by PGCIL, will now come up to
POSOCO.
Power System Operation Corporation Ltd (POSOCO), a wholly owned subsidiary of
the Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (a Government Company) shall operate
National Load Despatch Center and the five Regional Load Despatch Centers, with
effect from October 1, 2010.
To make load despatch centers financially self-reliant and autonomous, the
committee recommended independent and sustainable revenue streams. The move
to separate the two functions is in keeping with the provisions of the Electricity Act,
2003, which seeks to separate commercial interests from load management
functions. The Pradhan committee had recommended setting up a separate
representative board structure overseeing the functions of the five regional load
despatch centers (RLDCs) run by PGCIL\u2014the northern, eastern, north-eastern,
western and southern regions at that time.

    FUNCTIONS OF ERLDC
The role and functions of ERLDC, as per Section 28 of Electricity Act 2003 are: To
ensure integrated operation of power system in the Eastern Region. Specifically,
Eastern Regional Load Despatch Center shall:-
1. be responsible for optimum scheduling and despatch of electricity within the
region, in accordance with the contracts entered into with the licensees or the
generating companies operating in the region
2. Monitor grid operations
3. Keep accounts of quantity of electricity transmitted through the regional grid
4. Exercise supervision and control over the inter-state transmission system
5. be responsible for carrying out real time operations for grid control and despatch
of electricity within the region through secure and economic operation of the regional
grid in accordance with the Grid Standards
6. To levy and collect such fees & charges from the generating companies or
licensees engaged in inter-state transmission of electricity as may be specified by
the Central Commission.
All the utilities like generators, sellers, buyers and traders of the Eastern Regional
grid has to schedule their power transactions through ERLDC for optimum utilization
of power in real time operation.
Eastern Region is connected to all the other four regions of India. Except Southern
Region it is synchronized with the all other grids; while it is connected through
HVDC line with the Southern grid.

POWER FLOW/LOAD FLOW -
The process of solving the algebraic equations for given loads and generator power
outputs, is referred to as Load Flow or Power Flow Calculation.
Problem definition -
\u201cGiven the load power consumption at all buses of the electric power system and the
power generation at each power plant, find the power flow through each line /
transformer of the interconnected network\u201d.
Purpose of load flow -
To ensure:
1. The system is stable in the steady-state, i.e. there is enough transmission
capacity
2. Transmission capacity is adequate even with some lines out of service

4. The flow of reactive power in the system is acceptable.
Iteration schemes used -
01. Gauss-Seidel Iteration
02. Full Newton-Raphson iteration
03. Decoupled Newton-Raphson iteration
Contingency Analysis
Contingency analysis is the study of the outage of elements such as transmission
lines, transformers and generators, and investigation of the resulting effects on line
power flows and bus voltages of the remaining system. It represents an important
tool to study the effect of elements outages in power system security during
operation and planning. Contingencies referring to disturbances such as
transmission element outages or generator outages may cause sudden and large
changes in both the configuration and the state of the system. Contingencies may
result in severe violations of the operating constraints. Consequently, planning for
contingencies forms an important aspect of secure operation.
Fault Studies
The short circuit module has a number of short circuit calculation algorithms to meet
the diverse needs of fault analyses. All algorithms are self-contained within PSS®E,
and the module requires only a valid power flow working case and the power system
zero and negative sequence data. The short circuit module can simulate one or all
fault types at one bus or all system or sub-system buses in one run, thereby
reducing analysis time.
In addition, PSS®E performs IEC 60909-based fault analysis. The single
requirement prior to entering the IEC fault calculation method is a valid power flow
working case.

    The system zero and negative sequence data is required only if unsymmetrical
faults are to be simulated. The PSS®E short circuit analysis is well suited to follow
protection coordination work.

    SCADA
WHAT IS SCADA?
SCADA stands for Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition system.
SCADA is the backbone of automation of all industries. Operators are
able to observe the state of monitored process by simply examining the
data base through display on work stations, control terminals or PCs.
SCADA is composed of remote terminal unit (RTU), communication
system, and control center.
A BRIEF HISTORY
The development of SCADA can be traced back to the early 1900\u2019s with
the advent of telemetry. Telemetry involves the transmission and
collection of data obtained by sensing real-time conditions. The
monitoring of remote conditions became possible with the convergence of
electricity, telegraph, telephone, and wireless communication technology.
Throughout the last century, more industries, such as gas, electric, and
water utilities, used telemetry systems to monitor processes at remote
sites. SCADA began in the early sixties as an electronic system operating
as Input/output (I/O) signal transmissions between a master station and a
Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) station. The master station would receive
the I/O transmissions from the RTU through a telemetry network and then
store the data on mainframe computers.
In the early seventies, DCS
(Distributed Control Systems) were developed. The ISAS5.1 standard
defines a distributed control system as a system that while being
functionally integrated consists of subsystems, which may be physically
separate and remotely located from one another. Large manufacturers
and process facilities utilized DCS primarily because they required large
 
  ', 
  ', 
      ', 
        16.
      ', 
    amounts of analog control. Further development enabled Distributed
Control Systems to use Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC), which
being more intelligent than RTUs, have the ability to control sites without
taking direction from a master.
In the late nineties, the differences
between SCADA and DCS blurred. SCADA Systems had DCS
capabilities. DCS had SCADA capabilities. Systems were customized
based on certain control features built in by designers. Now with the
Internet being utilized more as a communication tool, control functions
that were once old telemetry systems are becoming more advanced,
interconnected and accessible. Automated software products are being
developed to exploit the inter-connectivity of the Internet and certain
portals can connect to a SCADA system and download information or
control a process. Good SCADA systems today not only control
processes but are also used for measuring, forecasting, billing, analyzing
and planning. Today\u2019s SCADA system must meet a whole new level of
control automation, interfacing with yesterday\u2019s obsolete equipment yet
flexible enough to adapt to tomorrow\u2019s changes.
SYSTEM COMPONENTS: SCADA systems typically have four major
elements:
1. Master Terminal Unit (MTU)
2. Remote Terminal Unit (RTU)
3. Communication Equipment
4. SCADA Software

    1. Master Terminal Unit (MTU)
The Master Terminal Unit is usually defined as the master or heart of a
SCADA system and is located at the operator\u2019s central control facility.
The MTU initiates virtually all communication with remote sites and
interfaces with an operator. Data from remote field devices (pumps,
valves, alarms, etc.) is sent to the MTU to be processed, stored and/or
sent to other systems. For example, the MTU may send the data to the
operator\u2019s display console, store the information, and then send an
operator\u2019s initiate command to a field pump\u2019s RTU.
2. Remote Terminal Unit (RTU)
The Remote Terminal Unit is usually defined as a communication satellite
within the SCADA system and is located at the remote site. The RTU
gathers data from field devices (pumps, valves, alarms, etc.) in memory
until the MTU initiates a send command. Some RTUs are designed with
microcomputers and programmable logic controllers (PLCs) that can
perform functions at the remote site without any direction from the MTU.
In addition, PLCs can be modular and expandable for the purpose of
monitoring and controlling additional field devices. Within the RTU is the
central processing unit (CPU) that receives a data stream from the
protocol that the communication equipment uses. The protocol can be
open like Modbus, Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol
(TCP/IP) or a proprietary closed protocol. When the RTU sees its node
 
  ', 
  ', 
      ', 
        18.
      ', 
    address embedded in the protocol, data is interpreted and the CPU
directs the specified action to take.
Some manufacturers, like EPG\u2019s SCADA division NBT, now make
Remote Access PLCs (RAPLC) specifically designed for SCADA and
Data Acquisition applications. With NBT\u2019s PLC system, you can:
\uf0b7 Perform control
\uf0b7 Check site conditions
\uf0b7 Re-program anytime from anywhere
\uf0b7 Have any alarm or event trigger a call to your personal computer
This can all be done from a single, master site and the system can control
one or multiple sites. Both industry representatives and customers
welcome these \u201csmart\u201d PLCs because they provide remote
programmable functionality while retaining the communications capability
of an RTU.

      ', 
    3. Communication Equipment
The way the SCADA system network (topology) is set up can vary with
each system but there must be uninterrupted, bidirectional
communication between the MTU and the RTU for a SCADA or Data
Acquisition system to function properly. This can be accomplished in
various ways, i.e. private wire lines, buried cable, telephone, radios,
modems, microwave dishes, satellites, or other Atmospheric means, and
many times, systems employ more than one means of communicating to
the remote site. This may include dial-up or dedicated voice grade
telephone lines, DSL (Digital Subscriber Line), Integrated Service Digital
Network (ISDN), cable, fiber optics, Wi-Fi, or other broadband services.
4. SCADA Software
A typical SCADA system provides a Human Machine Interface (HMI)
allowing the operator to visualize all the functions as the system is
operating. The operator can also use the HMI to change set points, view
critical condition alerts and warnings, and analyze, archive or present
data trends. Since the advent of Windows NT, the HMI software can be
installed on PC hardware as a reliable representation of the real system
at work. Common HMI software packages include Cimplicity (GE-Fanuc),
RSView (Rockwell Automation), IFIX (Intellution) and InTouch
(Wonderware). Most of these software packages use standard data
manipulation or presentation tools for reporting and archiving data and
integrate well with Microsoft Excel, Access and Word. Web-based
technology is widely being accepted as well. Data collected by the
SCADA system is sent to web servers that dynamically generate HTML
pages. These pages are then sent to a LAN system at the operator\u2019s site
or published to the Internet.

    Data acquisition begins with the physical phenomenon to be measured.
This physical phenomenon could be the temperature of a room, the
intensity of a light source, the pressure inside a chamber, the force
applied to an object, or many other things. An effective data acquisition
system can measure all of these different phenomena. A transducer is a
device that converts a physical phenomenon into a measurable electrical
signal, such as voltage or current. The ability of a data acquisition system
to measure different phenomena depends on the transducers to convert
the physical phenomena into signals measurable by the data acquisition
hardware. Transducers are synonymous with sensors in data acquisition
systems. There are specific transducers for many different applications,
such as measuring temperature, pressure, or fluid flow.
Phenomenon Transducer
Temperature Thermocouple, RTD, Thermistor
Light Photo Sensor
Sound Microphone
Force and Pressure Strain Gage, Piezoelectric Transducer
Position and Potentiometer, LVDT, Optical Encode
Different transducers have different requirements for converting
phenomena into a measurable signal. Some transducers may require
excitation in the form of voltage or current. Other transducers may require
additional components and even resistive networks to produce a signal.

USE AND CONTROL OF SCADA:
It provides control and monitoring of the mechanical and electrical utility
systems serving the critical loads.

detecting when it varies from the desired state, and taking action to
restore it. Control can be discrete or analog, manual or automatic, and
periodic or continuous.

Life after Commissioning: Understanding and Tuning Your
Synchrophasor System
One key focus of the synchrophasor community in 2013 is data quality.
Regional coordination entities across the world are collecting
synchrophasor data from utilities and recording metrics on data quality.
This issue of the Synchrophasor Report focuses on tuning your phasor

      ', 
    data concentrator (PDC) configuration to maximize high-quality data.
The phasor measurement units (PMUs) in synchrophasor systems
generate time-stamped data on a synchronized schedule, but the various
network delays between PMUs and PDCs practically guarantee that the
PMU data packets will not arrive simultaneously at their destination. A
core function of the PDC is to time-align synchrophasor data from multiple
sources and serve these data to a client.
Time alignment is the process of collecting all available synchrophasor
data packets with identical time stamps, packaging them into an
aggregate packet, and serving them to a client. As you may have
guessed, time alignment requires the PDC to wait for all packets to arrive
before generating the aggregate packet. To accomplish this, the PDC
uses a timer, often called the \u201cwait timer,\u201d which counts up to a user-
defined maximum wait period. If one or more PMU packets are delayed
beyond the maximum wait period, the PDC will generate and serve the
aggregate packet, omitting the delayed data. Then the PDC will provide
an indication that data from certain PMUs were never received.
What starts the wait timer?
There are two unique methods of time alignment defined by the IEEE
C37.244 Guide for Phasor Data Concentrator Requirements for Power
System Protection, Control, and Monitoring\u2014absolute time alignment and
relative time alignment.
Absolute time alignment means the PDC starts the wait timer on a
Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)-based schedule. This method:
\u2022 Requires the PDC to synch to UTC and waits no longer than the
user-defined maximum wait period for data with the equivalent UTC
time stamp.
\u2022 Allows a more deterministic packet transmit interval from the PDC,
which can be useful in control applications.
 
  ', 
  ', 
      ', 
        27.
      ', 
    \u2022 Benefits client applications that favor minimal latency over data
completeness/quality. Relative time alignment means the PDC starts
the wait timer based on an event, which is typically the receipt of
data with a new UTC time stamp. This method:
\u2022 Does not require a synch to UTC.
\u2022 Allows latency common to all PMU data to be factored out of
the actual PDC wait time.
\u2022 Benefits client applications that favor data
completeness/quality over minimal latency.
Figure 1. Shows an example of each type of time alignment. Notice in
each case that all PMU data packets are received within the duration of
the user-defined maximum wait period.

    Fig. 1. Absolute and relative time alignment with no missed data.
SEL\u2019s modern synchrophasor solutions employ relative time alignment for
the sake of data completeness/quality. For latency critical applications,
SEL suggests establishing a dedicated output from your PDC that
includes only the critical data. The remainder of this report will focus
exclusively on relative time alignment.

Note that the PMU 15 packet arrives after the PMU 2 packet\u2019s arrival time
and maximum wait period. As a result, the PDC waits no longer than the
user-defined maximum wait period before closing the time alignment
window and beginning the output processing.

GENERATOR ROOM:
There are two types of generators in ERLDC, one is 400 KVA, model no. VTA1710
and other one is 125 KVA, both are manufactured by Cummins. These generators
are used for back-up power. Diesel engine is used to run the generator because of
its higher efficiency (as high as 43 \u2013 45 %) and it\u2019s more efficient plant performance
under part loads which is operate at a speed 1500 rpm, 50 Hz frequency. The
manifesto of diesel engine is more oxygen, more power. To achieve this a
turbocharger is used, has two main parts a) turbine b) compressor, it is driven by
exhaust gases, because of this more fuel can burn in the engine and efficiency will
increased.
DG Set as a System
A diesel generating set should be considered as a system since its successful
operation depends on the well-matched performance of the components, namely:
a) The diesel engine and its accessories.
b) The AC Generator.
c) The control systems and switchgear.
d) The foundation and power house civil works.
e) The connected load with its own components like heating, motor drives, lighting
etc.
It is necessary to select the components with highest efficiency and operate them at
their Optimum efficiency levels to conserve energy in this system.

Energy Saving Measures for DG Sets
a) Ensure steady load conditions on the DG set, and provide cold, dust free air at
intake (use of air washers for large sets, in case of dry, hot weather, can be
considered).
b) Improve air filtration.
c) Ensure fuel oil storage, handling and preparation as per manufacturers'
guidelines/oil company data.
d) Consider fuel oil additives in case they benefit fuel oil properties for DG set
usage.
e) Calibrate fuel injection pumps frequently.
f) Ensure compliance with maintenance checklist.
TRANSFORMERS:
Electricity in ERLDC, as a bulk consumer, is supplied by Calcutta Electric Supply
Corporation (CESC). Therefore transformers are needed to step down the voltage
6kv to 415v. There are two step-down transformers available in erldc complex but
only one used and other one is for backup. Both transformers are delta-star
connected, rating of 1MVA, 50 Hz, 6000/415 Volts.
AC PLANT:
Chillers are a key component of air conditioning systems for large buildings. They
produce cold water to remove heat from the air in the building. They also provide
cooling for process loads such as file-server rooms and large medical imaging
equipment. As with other types of air conditioning systems, most
Chillers extract heat from water by mechanically compressing a refrigerant.
 
  ", 
  ', 
      ', 
        32.
      ', 
    There are 3 Chillers available at ERLDC, each have a capacity of 40 tons. Two of
them are consecutively used during summer otherwise one chiller is used for cooling
in control room and other departments of grid building.
Mechanical Compression Chillers
During the compression cycle, the refrigerant passes through four major
components within the chiller: the evaporator, the compressor, the condenser, and a
flow-metering device such as an expansion valve. The evaporator is the low-
temperature (cooling) side of the system and the condenser is the high temperature
(heat-rejection) side of the system.
Evaporator
Chillers produce chilled water in the evaporator where cold refrigerant flows over the
evaporator tube bundle. The refrigerant evaporates (changes into vapour) as the
heat is transferred from the water to the refrigerant. The chilled water is then
pumped, via the chilled-water distribution system to the building\u2019s air handling units.
The chilled water passes through coils in the air-handler to remove heat from the air
used to condition spaces throughout the building. The warm water (warmed by the
heat transferred from the building ventilation air) returns to the evaporator and the
cycle starts over.
Compressor
 
  ', 
  ', 
      ', 
        33.
      ', 
    Vaporized refrigerant leaves the evaporator and travels to the compressor where it
is mechanically compressed, and changed into a high-pressure, high-temperature
vapour. Upon leaving the compressor, the refrigerant enters the condenser side of
the chiller.
Condenser
Inside the water-cooled condenser, hot refrigerant flows around the tubes containing
the condenser-loop water. The heat transfers to the water, causing the refrigerant to
condense into liquid form. The condenser water is pumped from the condenser
bundle to the cooling tower where heat is transferred from the water to the
atmosphere. The liquid refrigerant then travels to the expansion valve.
Expansion valve
The refrigerant flows into the evaporator through the expansion valve or metering
device. This valve controls the rate of cooling. Once through the valve, the
refrigerant expands to a lower pressure and a much lower temperature. It flows
around the evaporator tubes, absorbing the heat of the chilled water that\u2019s been
returned from the air handlers, completing the refrigeration cycle.
Chillers are complex machines that are expensive to purchase
and operate. A preventive and predictive maintenance program is the best
protection for this valuable asset. Chillers commonly use more energy than any
other piece of equipment in large buildings. Maintaining them well and operating
them smartly can yield significant energy savings. Nowadays, Chillers are controlled
by sophisticated, on-board microprocessors. Chiller control systems include safety
and operating controls. If the equipment malfunctions, the safety control shuts the
chiller down to prevent serious damage to the machine.
WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM:
Introduction
The water supply system in the ERLDC office complex has an elaborate
arrangement that provides adequate redundancy for maintaining 24 hrs. water
supply to the entire complex. The water supply system caters the supply for drinking
water, make up water for air conditioning plant and rest of the facilities in the
complex. The unique arrangement for the entire supply system depends on three
sources of supply providing adequate redundancy.

Reservoirs
There are three reservoirs for the storage of water from where it is lifted to
designated overhead tanks.
Reservoir 1 (location: pump house): for the purpose of intermediate storing
drinking water. This reservoir receives treated water supply meant for drinking
purpose from Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC).
Reservoir 2 (location: pump house): for the purpose of intermediate storing
of water for supply to other facilities such as use of water at toilets, bathrooms,
for cleaning & gardening.
Reservoir 3 (location: backyard western part): for the purpose of stand by
storing of water supply of water to overhead tank at Technical block of ERLDC

SEM: TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION
01. The energy metering system specified herein is used for tariff metering for bulk,
inter-utility power flows, in different Regions of India. One static type composite
meter is installed for each EHV circuit, as a self-contained device for measurement
of active energy (MWh) transmittals in each successive 15 minute block and certain
other functions, as described in the following paragraphs.
02. The meters is suitable for being connected directly to voltage transformers
(VTs) having a rated secondary line-to-line voltage of 110V, and to current
transformers (CTs) having a rated secondary current of 1 A (model-A) or 5A (model-
B). Any further transformers/transactions/transducers required for their functioning is
in-built in the meters. Necessary isolation and/or suppression is also be built-in, for
protecting the meters from surges and voltage spikes that occur in the VT and CT
circuits of extra high voltage switchyards. The reference frequency is 50Hz.
03. The active energy (Wh) measurement is carried out on 3-phase, 4-wire principle,
with an accuracy as per class 0.2 S of IEC-62053-22:2003. In model-A (for CT
secondary rating 1A), the energy is computed directly in CT and VT secondary
quantities, and indicated in watt-hours. The meter computes the net active energy
(Wh) sent out from the substation bus bars during each successive 15-minutes
block, and stores it in its memory along with plus/minus sign. It also displays on
demand the net Wh sent out during the previous 15-minute block, with a minus sign
if there is net Wh export.
04. Further, the meter continuously integrates and display on demand the net
cumulative active energy sent out from the substation bus bars upto that time. The
cumulative Wh reading at each midnight is stored in the meter\u2019s memory. The
register moves backwards when active power flows back to substation bus bars.
05. The meter counts the number of cycles in VT output during each successive
15-minutes block, and divides the same by 900 to arrive at the average frequency.
This is stored in the meter\u2019s memory as a 2-digit code which is arrived at by
subtracting 49 from the average frequency, multiplying by 50 and neglecting all
decimals. For example, 49.89 Hz is recorded as 44. In case the average frequency
 
  ', 
  ', 
      ', 
        38.
      ', 
    is less than 49.0 Hz, it is recorded as 00. In case it is 51.0 Hz or higher, it is
recorded as 99. The average frequency of the previous
15-minutes block is also be displayed, on demand in hertz.
06. The meter also computes the reactive power (VAR) on 3-phase, 4-wire principle,
with an accuracy as specified in clause 11.0, and integrate the reactive energy
(VARh) algebraically into two separate registers, one for the period for which the
average RMS voltage is 103.0% or higher, and the other for the period for which the
average RMS voltage is below 97.0%. The current reactive power (VAR), with a
minus sign if negative and cumulative reactive energy (VARh) readings of the two
registers is displayed on demand.
The readings of the two registers at each midnight are stored in the meter\u2019s
memory. In model-A (for CT secondary rating of 1 A), the reactive power and
reactive energy transmittals is computed in VAR/VARh directly calculated in CT and
VT secondary quantities. When lagging reactive power is being sent out from
substation bus bars, VAR display have a plus sign or no sign and VARh registers
move forward. When reactive power flow is in the reverse direction, VAR display
have negative sign and VARh registers move backwards.
07. In the model-B (for CT secondary rating of 5A), all computations, displays and
memory storage is similar except that all figures is be one fifth of the actual Wh,
VAR and VARh worked out from CT and VT secondary quantities.
08. The three line-to-neutral voltage is continuously monitored and in case any of
these falls below about 70%, a normally flashing lamp provided on meter\u2019s front
become steady. It go off it all three voltages fall below 70%. The time blocks in
which such a voltage failure occurs/persists is recorded in the meter\u2019s memory. The
lamp automatically resumes flashing when all VT secondary voltages are healthy
again. The two VARh registers specified in clause 7.0 remains stay-put while VT
supply is unhealthy.
09. The whole system is such as to provide a print out (both from the local PC, and
from remote central computer) of the following form:
16 55 +16.28 56 +15.95 55 +15.32 54 +15.66

    DATA STORAGE
This 0.2 class accuracy static energy meter can record integrated average
frequency and active energy over every 15 min blocks. The SEM also stores the
daily reactive energy flows in low voltage & high voltage conditions. SEM can store
data for 10 days. The text file (*.NPC) made from coded files (*.MRI,*.DAT, *.DCD)
etc. includes data of one complete day corresponding to the day on which reading is
taken and 9 days of complete data for the previous days.
DATA COLLECTING DEVICE (DCDs)
It is basically data collecting device and used to transfer the tapped data from SEM
to
PC. It has bi -communication with special energy meter along with personnel
computer. All these is done with communication cable one at DCD end and other at

    The Power System in India is organized in five electrical regions for operational and
planning purpose namely North, South, East, West and North-east. Eastern
Region with an installed generating capacity of 28337.75 MW (as on 12.10.2012) is
connected with all four regions of the country. It is also electrically connected with
Bhutan and Nepal.
Eastern Region constituents include mainly five states, Damodar Valley Corporation,
Central Sector Generating Stations (NTPC and NHPC) and one Central
Transmission Utility (CTU). Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) is a vertically
integrated utility like a SEB and has its own Generation, Transmission and
Distribution in the identified command area of Jharkhand and West Bengal. DVC
has a separate Control Center at Maithon. A few interstate lines between
Jharkhand and West Bengal that form a part of the Inter State Transmission System
are also operated and maintained by the DVC.
Presently all the regions are synchronized electrically as single block. The
Exchange of power among the synchronized regions takes place through
765/400/220KV transmission lines and 800/1200KV HVDC interconnections
whereas the power Exchange with Southern Region is through HVDC
interconnections. In each Region, the Generation, Transmission and Distribution of
Power along with State Lines is organized such that the State owned Power
Systems and Load Despatch Centers are operated by State Transmission
Companies. The State Transmission Companies and the Central Sector Group of
agencies are referred to as Constituents. The operation of the each Regional Grid is
managed by the Regional Load Despatch enter (RLDC) with underlying State Load
Despatch Center (SLDCs) and Sub-LDCs. At National level to supervise the RLDCs
and to monitor the Inter Regional Power Exchanges, a National Load Despatch

    POWER SYSTEM OPERATION CORPORATION LIMITED
Introduction \u2013 Formation of POSOCO:
Power System Operation Corporation Limited (POSOCO) is a
wholly owned subsidiary of Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (PGCIL). It was
formed in March 2010 to handle the power management functions of PGCIL. It is
responsible to ensure the integrated operation of the Grid in a reliable, efficient and
secure manner. It consists of 5 Regional Load despatch Centers and a National
Load Despatch Center (NLDC). The subsidiary may eventually be made a separate
company, leaving the parent firm with only the task of setting up transmission links.
The load despatch functions, earlier handled by PGCIL, will now come up to
POSOCO.
Power System Operation Corporation Ltd (POSOCO), a wholly owned subsidiary of
the Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (a Government Company) shall operate
National Load Despatch Center and the five Regional Load Despatch Centers, with
effect from October 1, 2010.
To make load despatch centers financially self-reliant and autonomous, the
committee recommended independent and sustainable revenue streams. The move
to separate the two functions is in keeping with the provisions of the Electricity Act,
2003, which seeks to separate commercial interests from load management
functions. The Pradhan committee had recommended setting up a separate
representative board structure overseeing the functions of the five regional load
despatch centers (RLDCs) run by PGCIL\u2014the northern, eastern, north-eastern,
western and southern regions at that time.

    FUNCTIONS OF ERLDC
The role and functions of ERLDC, as per Section 28 of Electricity Act 2003 are: To
ensure integrated operation of power system in the Eastern Region. Specifically,
Eastern Regional Load Despatch Center shall:-
1. be responsible for optimum scheduling and despatch of electricity within the
region, in accordance with the contracts entered into with the licensees or the
generating companies operating in the region
2. Monitor grid operations
3. Keep accounts of quantity of electricity transmitted through the regional grid
4. Exercise supervision and control over the inter-state transmission system
5. be responsible for carrying out real time operations for grid control and despatch
of electricity within the region through secure and economic operation of the regional
grid in accordance with the Grid Standards
6. To levy and collect such fees & charges from the generating companies or
licensees engaged in inter-state transmission of electricity as may be specified by
the Central Commission.
All the utilities like generators, sellers, buyers and traders of the Eastern Regional
grid has to schedule their power transactions through ERLDC for optimum utilization
of power in real time operation.
Eastern Region is connected to all the other four regions of India. Except Southern
Region it is synchronized with the all other grids; while it is connected through
HVDC line with the Southern grid.

POWER FLOW/LOAD FLOW -
The process of solving the algebraic equations for given loads and generator power
outputs, is referred to as Load Flow or Power Flow Calculation.
Problem definition -
\u201cGiven the load power consumption at all buses of the electric power system and the
power generation at each power plant, find the power flow through each line /
transformer of the interconnected network\u201d.
Purpose of load flow -
To ensure:
1. The system is stable in the steady-state, i.e. there is enough transmission
capacity
2. Transmission capacity is adequate even with some lines out of service

4. The flow of reactive power in the system is acceptable.
Iteration schemes used -
01. Gauss-Seidel Iteration
02. Full Newton-Raphson iteration
03. Decoupled Newton-Raphson iteration
Contingency Analysis
Contingency analysis is the study of the outage of elements such as transmission
lines, transformers and generators, and investigation of the resulting effects on line
power flows and bus voltages of the remaining system. It represents an important
tool to study the effect of elements outages in power system security during
operation and planning. Contingencies referring to disturbances such as
transmission element outages or generator outages may cause sudden and large
changes in both the configuration and the state of the system. Contingencies may
result in severe violations of the operating constraints. Consequently, planning for
contingencies forms an important aspect of secure operation.
Fault Studies
The short circuit module has a number of short circuit calculation algorithms to meet
the diverse needs of fault analyses. All algorithms are self-contained within PSS®E,
and the module requires only a valid power flow working case and the power system
zero and negative sequence data. The short circuit module can simulate one or all
fault types at one bus or all system or sub-system buses in one run, thereby
reducing analysis time.
In addition, PSS®E performs IEC 60909-based fault analysis. The single
requirement prior to entering the IEC fault calculation method is a valid power flow
working case.

    SCADA
WHAT IS SCADA?
SCADA stands for Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition system.
SCADA is the backbone of automation of all industries. Operators are
able to observe the state of monitored process by simply examining the
data base through display on work stations, control terminals or PCs.
SCADA is composed of remote terminal unit (RTU), communication
system, and control center.
A BRIEF HISTORY
The development of SCADA can be traced back to the early 1900\u2019s with
the advent of telemetry. Telemetry involves the transmission and
collection of data obtained by sensing real-time conditions. The
monitoring of remote conditions became possible with the convergence of
electricity, telegraph, telephone, and wireless communication technology.
Throughout the last century, more industries, such as gas, electric, and
water utilities, used telemetry systems to monitor processes at remote
sites. SCADA began in the early sixties as an electronic system operating
as Input/output (I/O) signal transmissions between a master station and a
Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) station. The master station would receive
the I/O transmissions from the RTU through a telemetry network and then
store the data on mainframe computers.
In the early seventies, DCS
(Distributed Control Systems) were developed. The ISAS5.1 standard
defines a distributed control system as a system that while being
functionally integrated consists of subsystems, which may be physically
separate and remotely located from one another. Large manufacturers
and process facilities utilized DCS primarily because they required large
 
  ', 
  ', 
      ', 
        16.
      ', 
    amounts of analog control. Further development enabled Distributed
Control Systems to use Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC), which
being more intelligent than RTUs, have the ability to control sites without
taking direction from a master.
In the late nineties, the differences
between SCADA and DCS blurred. SCADA Systems had DCS
capabilities. DCS had SCADA capabilities. Systems were customized
based on certain control features built in by designers. Now with the
Internet being utilized more as a communication tool, control functions
that were once old telemetry systems are becoming more advanced,
interconnected and accessible. Automated software products are being
developed to exploit the inter-connectivity of the Internet and certain
portals can connect to a SCADA system and download information or
control a process. Good SCADA systems today not only control
processes but are also used for measuring, forecasting, billing, analyzing
and planning. Today\u2019s SCADA system must meet a whole new level of
control automation, interfacing with yesterday\u2019s obsolete equipment yet
flexible enough to adapt to tomorrow\u2019s changes.
SYSTEM COMPONENTS: SCADA systems typically have four major
elements:
1. Master Terminal Unit (MTU)
2. Remote Terminal Unit (RTU)
3. Communication Equipment
4. SCADA Software

    1. Master Terminal Unit (MTU)
The Master Terminal Unit is usually defined as the master or heart of a
SCADA system and is located at the operator\u2019s central control facility.
The MTU initiates virtually all communication with remote sites and
interfaces with an operator. Data from remote field devices (pumps,
valves, alarms, etc.) is sent to the MTU to be processed, stored and/or
sent to other systems. For example, the MTU may send the data to the
operator\u2019s display console, store the information, and then send an
operator\u2019s initiate command to a field pump\u2019s RTU.
2. Remote Terminal Unit (RTU)
The Remote Terminal Unit is usually defined as a communication satellite
within the SCADA system and is located at the remote site. The RTU
gathers data from field devices (pumps, valves, alarms, etc.) in memory
until the MTU initiates a send command. Some RTUs are designed with
microcomputers and programmable logic controllers (PLCs) that can
perform functions at the remote site without any direction from the MTU.
In addition, PLCs can be modular and expandable for the purpose of
monitoring and controlling additional field devices. Within the RTU is the
central processing unit (CPU) that receives a data stream from the
protocol that the communication equipment uses. The protocol can be
open like Modbus, Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol
(TCP/IP) or a proprietary closed protocol. When the RTU sees its node
 
  ', 
  ', 
      ', 
        18.
      ', 
    address embedded in the protocol, data is interpreted and the CPU
directs the specified action to take.
Some manufacturers, like EPG\u2019s SCADA division NBT, now make
Remote Access PLCs (RAPLC) specifically designed for SCADA and
Data Acquisition applications. With NBT\u2019s PLC system, you can:
\uf0b7 Perform control
\uf0b7 Check site conditions
\uf0b7 Re-program anytime from anywhere
\uf0b7 Have any alarm or event trigger a call to your personal computer
This can all be done from a single, master site and the system can control
one or multiple sites. Both industry representatives and customers
welcome these \u201csmart\u201d PLCs because they provide remote
programmable functionality while retaining the communications capability
of an RTU.

      ', 
    3. Communication Equipment
The way the SCADA system network (topology) is set up can vary with
each system but there must be uninterrupted, bidirectional
communication between the MTU and the RTU for a SCADA or Data
Acquisition system to function properly. This can be accomplished in
various ways, i.e. private wire lines, buried cable, telephone, radios,
modems, microwave dishes, satellites, or other Atmospheric means, and
many times, systems employ more than one means of communicating to
the remote site. This may include dial-up or dedicated voice grade
telephone lines, DSL (Digital Subscriber Line), Integrated Service Digital
Network (ISDN), cable, fiber optics, Wi-Fi, or other broadband services.
4. SCADA Software
A typical SCADA system provides a Human Machine Interface (HMI)
allowing the operator to visualize all the functions as the system is
operating. The operator can also use the HMI to change set points, view
critical condition alerts and warnings, and analyze, archive or present
data trends. Since the advent of Windows NT, the HMI software can be
installed on PC hardware as a reliable representation of the real system
at work. Common HMI software packages include Cimplicity (GE-Fanuc),
RSView (Rockwell Automation), IFIX (Intellution) and InTouch
(Wonderware). Most of these software packages use standard data
manipulation or presentation tools for reporting and archiving data and
integrate well with Microsoft Excel, Access and Word. Web-based
technology is widely being accepted as well. Data collected by the
SCADA system is sent to web servers that dynamically generate HTML
pages. These pages are then sent to a LAN system at the operator\u2019s site
or published to the Internet.

    Data acquisition begins with the physical phenomenon to be measured.
This physical phenomenon could be the temperature of a room, the
intensity of a light source, the pressure inside a chamber, the force
applied to an object, or many other things. An effective data acquisition
system can measure all of these different phenomena. A transducer is a
device that converts a physical phenomenon into a measurable electrical
signal, such as voltage or current. The ability of a data acquisition system
to measure different phenomena depends on the transducers to convert
the physical phenomena into signals measurable by the data acquisition
hardware. Transducers are synonymous with sensors in data acquisition
systems. There are specific transducers for many different applications,
such as measuring temperature, pressure, or fluid flow.
Phenomenon Transducer
Temperature Thermocouple, RTD, Thermistor
Light Photo Sensor
Sound Microphone
Force and Pressure Strain Gage, Piezoelectric Transducer
Position and Potentiometer, LVDT, Optical Encode
Different transducers have different requirements for converting
phenomena into a measurable signal. Some transducers may require
excitation in the form of voltage or current. Other transducers may require
additional components and even resistive networks to produce a signal.

restore it. Control can be discrete or analog, manual or automatic, and
periodic or continuous.

Life after Commissioning: Understanding and Tuning Your
Synchrophasor System
One key focus of the synchrophasor community in 2013 is data quality.
Regional coordination entities across the world are collecting
synchrophasor data from utilities and recording metrics on data quality.
This issue of the Synchrophasor Report focuses on tuning your phasor

  ',

      ', 
    data concentrator (PDC) configuration to maximize high-quality data.
The phasor measurement units (PMUs) in synchrophasor systems
generate time-stamped data on a synchronized schedule, but the various
network delays between PMUs and PDCs practically guarantee that the
PMU data packets will not arrive simultaneously at their destination. A
core function of the PDC is to time-align synchrophasor data from multiple
sources and serve these data to a client.
Time alignment is the process of collecting all available synchrophasor
data packets with identical time stamps, packaging them into an
aggregate packet, and serving them to a client. As you may have
guessed, time alignment requires the PDC to wait for all packets to arrive
before generating the aggregate packet. To accomplish this, the PDC
uses a timer, often called the \u201cwait timer,\u201d which counts up to a user-
defined maximum wait period. If one or more PMU packets are delayed
beyond the maximum wait period, the PDC will generate and serve the
aggregate packet, omitting the delayed data. Then the PDC will provide
an indication that data from certain PMUs were never received.
What starts the wait timer?
There are two unique methods of time alignment defined by the IEEE
C37.244 Guide for Phasor Data Concentrator Requirements for Power
System Protection, Control, and Monitoring\u2014absolute time alignment and
relative time alignment.
Absolute time alignment means the PDC starts the wait timer on a
Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)-based schedule. This method:
\u2022 Requires the PDC to synch to UTC and waits no longer than the
user-defined maximum wait period for data with the equivalent UTC
time stamp.
\u2022 Allows a more deterministic packet transmit interval from the PDC,
which can be useful in control applications.
 
  ', 
  ', 
      ', 
        27.
      ', 
    \u2022 Benefits client applications that favor minimal latency over data
completeness/quality. Relative time alignment means the PDC starts
the wait timer based on an event, which is typically the receipt of
data with a new UTC time stamp. This method:
\u2022 Does not require a synch to UTC.
\u2022 Allows latency common to all PMU data to be factored out of
the actual PDC wait time.
\u2022 Benefits client applications that favor data
completeness/quality over minimal latency.
Figure 1. Shows an example of each type of time alignment. Notice in
each case that all PMU data packets are received within the duration of
the user-defined maximum wait period.

the sake of data completeness/quality. For latency critical applications,
SEL suggests establishing a dedicated output from your PDC that
includes only the critical data. The remainder of this report will focus
exclusively on relative time alignment.

GENERATOR ROOM:
There are two types of generators in ERLDC, one is 400 KVA, model no. VTA1710
and other one is 125 KVA, both are manufactured by Cummins. These generators
are used for back-up power. Diesel engine is used to run the generator because of
its higher efficiency (as high as 43 \u2013 45 %) and it\u2019s more efficient plant performance
under part loads which is operate at a speed 1500 rpm, 50 Hz frequency. The
manifesto of diesel engine is more oxygen, more power. To achieve this a
turbocharger is used, has two main parts a) turbine b) compressor, it is driven by
exhaust gases, because of this more fuel can burn in the engine and efficiency will
increased.
DG Set as a System
A diesel generating set should be considered as a system since its successful
operation depends on the well-matched performance of the components, namely:
a) The diesel engine and its accessories.
b) The AC Generator.
c) The control systems and switchgear.
d) The foundation and power house civil works.
e) The connected load with its own components like heating, motor drives, lighting
etc.
It is necessary to select the components with highest efficiency and operate them at
their Optimum efficiency levels to conserve energy in this system.

Energy Saving Measures for DG Sets
a) Ensure steady load conditions on the DG set, and provide cold, dust free air at
intake (use of air washers for large sets, in case of dry, hot weather, can be
considered).
b) Improve air filtration.
c) Ensure fuel oil storage, handling and preparation as per manufacturers'
guidelines/oil company data.
d) Consider fuel oil additives in case they benefit fuel oil properties for DG set
usage.
e) Calibrate fuel injection pumps frequently.
f) Ensure compliance with maintenance checklist.
TRANSFORMERS:
Electricity in ERLDC, as a bulk consumer, is supplied by Calcutta Electric Supply
Corporation (CESC). Therefore transformers are needed to step down the voltage
6kv to 415v. There are two step-down transformers available in erldc complex but
only one used and other one is for backup. Both transformers are delta-star
connected, rating of 1MVA, 50 Hz, 6000/415 Volts.
AC PLANT:
Chillers are a key component of air conditioning systems for large buildings. They
produce cold water to remove heat from the air in the building. They also provide
cooling for process loads such as file-server rooms and large medical imaging
equipment. As with other types of air conditioning systems, most
Chillers extract heat from water by mechanically compressing a refrigerant.
 
  ", 
  ', 
      ', 
        32.
      ', 
    There are 3 Chillers available at ERLDC, each have a capacity of 40 tons. Two of
them are consecutively used during summer otherwise one chiller is used for cooling
in control room and other departments of grid building.
Mechanical Compression Chillers
During the compression cycle, the refrigerant passes through four major
components within the chiller: the evaporator, the compressor, the condenser, and a
flow-metering device such as an expansion valve. The evaporator is the low-
temperature (cooling) side of the system and the condenser is the high temperature
(heat-rejection) side of the system.
Evaporator
Chillers produce chilled water in the evaporator where cold refrigerant flows over the
evaporator tube bundle. The refrigerant evaporates (changes into vapour) as the
heat is transferred from the water to the refrigerant. The chilled water is then
pumped, via the chilled-water distribution system to the building\u2019s air handling units.
The chilled water passes through coils in the air-handler to remove heat from the air
used to condition spaces throughout the building. The warm water (warmed by the
heat transferred from the building ventilation air) returns to the evaporator and the
cycle starts over.
Compressor
 
  ', 
  ', 
      ', 
        33.
      ', 
    Vaporized refrigerant leaves the evaporator and travels to the compressor where it
is mechanically compressed, and changed into a high-pressure, high-temperature
vapour. Upon leaving the compressor, the refrigerant enters the condenser side of
the chiller.
Condenser
Inside the water-cooled condenser, hot refrigerant flows around the tubes containing
the condenser-loop water. The heat transfers to the water, causing the refrigerant to
condense into liquid form. The condenser water is pumped from the condenser
bundle to the cooling tower where heat is transferred from the water to the
atmosphere. The liquid refrigerant then travels to the expansion valve.
Expansion valve
The refrigerant flows into the evaporator through the expansion valve or metering
device. This valve controls the rate of cooling. Once through the valve, the
refrigerant expands to a lower pressure and a much lower temperature. It flows
around the evaporator tubes, absorbing the heat of the chilled water that\u2019s been
returned from the air handlers, completing the refrigeration cycle.
Chillers are complex machines that are expensive to purchase
and operate. A preventive and predictive maintenance program is the best
protection for this valuable asset. Chillers commonly use more energy than any
other piece of equipment in large buildings. Maintaining them well and operating
them smartly can yield significant energy savings. Nowadays, Chillers are controlled
by sophisticated, on-board microprocessors. Chiller control systems include safety
and operating controls. If the equipment malfunctions, the safety control shuts the
chiller down to prevent serious damage to the machine.
WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM:
Introduction
The water supply system in the ERLDC office complex has an elaborate
arrangement that provides adequate redundancy for maintaining 24 hrs. water
supply to the entire complex. The water supply system caters the supply for drinking
water, make up water for air conditioning plant and rest of the facilities in the
complex. The unique arrangement for the entire supply system depends on three
sources of supply providing adequate redundancy.

    Water sources
There are three sources of water as available in the complex
1. Bore well 1: located eastern part of the complex
2. Bore well 2: located western part of the complex
3. Corporation water supply location from southern part of the complex
Reservoirs
There are three reservoirs for the storage of water from where it is lifted to
designated overhead tanks.
Reservoir 1 (location: pump house): for the purpose of intermediate storing
drinking water. This reservoir receives treated water supply meant for drinking
purpose from Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC).
Reservoir 2 (location: pump house): for the purpose of intermediate storing
of water for supply to other facilities such as use of water at toilets, bathrooms,
for cleaning & gardening.
Reservoir 3 (location: backyard western part): for the purpose of stand by
storing of water supply of water to overhead tank at Technical block of ERLDC

SEM: TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION
01. The energy metering system specified herein is used for tariff metering for bulk,
inter-utility power flows, in different Regions of India. One static type composite
meter is installed for each EHV circuit, as a self-contained device for measurement
of active energy (MWh) transmittals in each successive 15 minute block and certain
other functions, as described in the following paragraphs.
02. The meters is suitable for being connected directly to voltage transformers
(VTs) having a rated secondary line-to-line voltage of 110V, and to current
transformers (CTs) having a rated secondary current of 1 A (model-A) or 5A (model-
B). Any further transformers/transactions/transducers required for their functioning is
in-built in the meters. Necessary isolation and/or suppression is also be built-in, for
protecting the meters from surges and voltage spikes that occur in the VT and CT
circuits of extra high voltage switchyards. The reference frequency is 50Hz.
03. The active energy (Wh) measurement is carried out on 3-phase, 4-wire principle,
with an accuracy as per class 0.2 S of IEC-62053-22:2003. In model-A (for CT
secondary rating 1A), the energy is computed directly in CT and VT secondary
quantities, and indicated in watt-hours. The meter computes the net active energy
(Wh) sent out from the substation bus bars during each successive 15-minutes
block, and stores it in its memory along with plus/minus sign. It also displays on
demand the net Wh sent out during the previous 15-minute block, with a minus sign
if there is net Wh export.
04. Further, the meter continuously integrates and display on demand the net
cumulative active energy sent out from the substation bus bars upto that time. The
cumulative Wh reading at each midnight is stored in the meter\u2019s memory. The
register moves backwards when active power flows back to substation bus bars.
05. The meter counts the number of cycles in VT output during each successive
15-minutes block, and divides the same by 900 to arrive at the average frequency.
This is stored in the meter\u2019s memory as a 2-digit code which is arrived at by
subtracting 49 from the average frequency, multiplying by 50 and neglecting all
decimals. For example, 49.89 Hz is recorded as 44. In case the average frequency
 
  ', 
  ', 
      ', 
        38.
      ', 
    is less than 49.0 Hz, it is recorded as 00. In case it is 51.0 Hz or higher, it is
recorded as 99. The average frequency of the previous
15-minutes block is also be displayed, on demand in hertz.
06. The meter also computes the reactive power (VAR) on 3-phase, 4-wire principle,
with an accuracy as specified in clause 11.0, and integrate the reactive energy
(VARh) algebraically into two separate registers, one for the period for which the
average RMS voltage is 103.0% or higher, and the other for the period for which the
average RMS voltage is below 97.0%. The current reactive power (VAR), with a
minus sign if negative and cumulative reactive energy (VARh) readings of the two
registers is displayed on demand.
The readings of the two registers at each midnight are stored in the meter\u2019s
memory. In model-A (for CT secondary rating of 1 A), the reactive power and
reactive energy transmittals is computed in VAR/VARh directly calculated in CT and
VT secondary quantities. When lagging reactive power is being sent out from
substation bus bars, VAR display have a plus sign or no sign and VARh registers
move forward. When reactive power flow is in the reverse direction, VAR display
have negative sign and VARh registers move backwards.
07. In the model-B (for CT secondary rating of 5A), all computations, displays and
memory storage is similar except that all figures is be one fifth of the actual Wh,
VAR and VARh worked out from CT and VT secondary quantities.
08. The three line-to-neutral voltage is continuously monitored and in case any of
these falls below about 70%, a normally flashing lamp provided on meter\u2019s front
become steady. It go off it all three voltages fall below 70%. The time blocks in
which such a voltage failure occurs/persists is recorded in the meter\u2019s memory. The
lamp automatically resumes flashing when all VT secondary voltages are healthy
again. The two VARh registers specified in clause 7.0 remains stay-put while VT
supply is unhealthy.
09. The whole system is such as to provide a print out (both from the local PC, and
from remote central computer) of the following form:
16 55 +16.28 56 +15.95 55 +15.32 54 +15.66

    DATA STORAGE
This 0.2 class accuracy static energy meter can record integrated average
frequency and active energy over every 15 min blocks. The SEM also stores the
daily reactive energy flows in low voltage & high voltage conditions. SEM can store
data for 10 days. The text file (*.NPC) made from coded files (*.MRI,*.DAT, *.DCD)
etc. includes data of one complete day corresponding to the day on which reading is
taken and 9 days of complete data for the previous days.
