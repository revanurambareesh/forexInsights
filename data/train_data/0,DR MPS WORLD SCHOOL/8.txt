', My Visit To Malta', 
', 
',  ', 
', 
', 
', 
', 
', 
', 

', 
', 
', 
', 
', My visit to Malta had a lot of expectations.',   ', After 28 years, I would once again visit
Europe, I was a 21 year old boy when I visited France & Italy and now as a
professional, with a changed perspective I was going to do the same.', 
', 
', 
', 
', 
', 
', 
', 
', Malta is beautiful and people from all round Europe descend
to enjoy in its scenic beauty & Mediterranean climate. I must admit, I indulged
in all the fun in Europe, ',  ', however, at
the back of my head, there was always this question: how can we keep our cities
& town back here in India in the same manner. Work ethics in Europe has changed everything. Indians are
the most lucky people on this planet. We never really suffered.', 
', 
', 
', 
', 
', 
', But have made great stories of our suffering. The island of
Malta was plundered repeatedly',   ', from
various invasions: the French, ',  ', the
Spanish, the English, the German & the Turks; everyone fought for Malta
because',    ', it was so strategic & so Christine,
people were ransacked killed, mutilated, lived in',   ', constant hardships. ',  ', That is why perhaps, Europe crystallized
itself as a united culture and',   ', people
respected each other. In India, we have plentiful of everything, so we plunder
our ',  ', natural resources and create all the
garbage for our neighbors. In doing so we have divided ourselves, in
establishing our supremacy, every region considers itself as superior to the
other & this goes as even with families. For those of you who understand Charles Dickens, Tess of de
Urbervilles will get my point of view. My experience in Malta helped me understand how focus, hard
work & national interest',   ', can ', m', ake a country marketable &
hospitable. Every person is involved in making the mission of the nation a
successful one,',   ', foreigners are treated
with utmost respect & people walk the extra mile just to make their
services more meaningful. The nation respects Edward de Bon',   ', more than any politician. In fact, ',  ', he gets more respect than the Prime Minister.
The de Bon University has done a phenomenal work in promoting creative thinking
& Entrepreneurship worldwide. Students from the US and all around Europe
flock to this university to learn through an education which provides a
different platform,',   ', making them
entrepreneurs of thinking. It did surprise me that thinking in itself can',   ', be used as a product for economic enhancement
& stability. The ambiance of the university has high level of cultural
diversity and thought process which encourages utility & entrepreneurship.',   ', My experience with the university enriched me
as I interacted with students, faculty & management. I am sure that this
visit has been very meaningful and I will be able to operate with more creative
perspectives. ',

', 
',

', 
',

', I extend gratitude to Dr. MPS World School and management
for encouragement & sponsorship of the same.

Space Concerns\u2019',

', 
', 
', By Mr. Charles Clarance
Principal   (Dr. MPS World School Agra)',

', Moderator at ALL INDIA EDU
LEADERS CONFERENCE, New Delhi.',

 ', 
', 
 ', 
', 
', 
', 
', 
', At the very onset I would like to draw your attention to my key words
of the Topic and that is Effective learning. The world learning in itself was a
paradigm shift that modern educators evolved to the process of education.  We then added the word effective to multiply
its efficacy. ', 
', 
', The use of computers or the digitalization of Education because it is a
new industry and permeates our life should not be the reason for incorporating
it in the effective learning process. The second danger I perceive that it
should not do more harm than good. If it teaches students to learn more that
they can handle then our problems will be manifold. As educators we know to
unlearn is more difficult to learn. The third important hurdle or angle that
must be taken into consideration is the financial aspect. Will the usability of
digitalization be cost effective? I must remind the august gathering here of
the kind of marketing that is done by the digital content vendors in term of
software and hardware.  The cleverly
marketed product is pressed down on educators by a whole team of carefully
manicured marketing strategist. The educators may fall prey to the glamour of
digitalization without fully comprehending its utility. I have been exposed to
redundant and terribly slow products that kill the creativity but have been
installed as a marketing strategy to display on billboards. Having cleared my
conscience on the predicament at hand I launch it to the plethora of using
cyber space to enhance effective learning processes. ', 
', 
', Learning is a process of self evolving depending upon the needs of the facilitators
as well as the learners. The word facilitator may please be read as advance
learner. Have mutually agreed that every learner has his /her own space and
pace the digital content actually adds true meaning to the classroom that caters
to all with its limited restricted environment and usually generalized the
learning capabilities. The Digital content acts as a highway on the journey of
self exploration. Once a teacher has enabled the students to relish the Solar System.
The student only needs the IT tools to quench his or her thirst on the topic.
These tools will work in the same way for all subjects. Our education system
had given very little importance to research in the early stages of learning. IT
efficacy will help students to network with all possibilities to enhance their capabilities
and will enrich classrooms with added information. ', 
', 
', 
', The Cyber world may also give unlimited space to exhibit talent and
vent ideas. Classrooms may take on a completely new meaning as learners may create
classrooms of their own without limitation of geographical boundaries. The
possibilities are immense but let us not throttle the possibilities due to any
fears of danger of the cyber space. As humans we are known for our adaptability
and the cyberspace is going to be no exception. Let me end by saying unless we
do not explore we will not  break new
ground.  ',

', My Visit To Malta', 
', 
',  ', 
', 
', 
', 
', 
', 
', 

', 
', 
', 
', 
', My visit to Malta had a lot of expectations.',   ', After 28 years, I would once again visit
Europe, I was a 21 year old boy when I visited France & Italy and now as a
professional, with a changed perspective I was going to do the same.', 
', 
', 
', 
', 
', 
', 
', 
', Malta is beautiful and people from all round Europe descend
to enjoy in its scenic beauty & Mediterranean climate. I must admit, I indulged
in all the fun in Europe, ',  ', however, at
the back of my head, there was always this question: how can we keep our cities
& town back here in India in the same manner. Work ethics in Europe has changed everything. Indians are
the most lucky people on this planet. We never really suffered.', 
', 
', 
', 
', 
', 
', But have made great stories of our suffering. The island of
Malta was plundered repeatedly',   ', from
various invasions: the French, ',  ', the
Spanish, the English, the German & the Turks; everyone fought for Malta
because',    ', it was so strategic & so Christine,
people were ransacked killed, mutilated, lived in',   ', constant hardships. ',  ', That is why perhaps, Europe crystallized
itself as a united culture and',   ', people
respected each other. In India, we have plentiful of everything, so we plunder
our ',  ', natural resources and create all the
garbage for our neighbors. In doing so we have divided ourselves, in
establishing our supremacy, every region considers itself as superior to the
other & this goes as even with families. For those of you who understand Charles Dickens, Tess of de
Urbervilles will get my point of view. My experience in Malta helped me understand how focus, hard
work & national interest',   ', can ', m', ake a country marketable &
hospitable. Every person is involved in making the mission of the nation a
successful one,',   ', foreigners are treated
with utmost respect & people walk the extra mile just to make their
services more meaningful. The nation respects Edward de Bon',   ', more than any politician. In fact, ',  ', he gets more respect than the Prime Minister.
The de Bon University has done a phenomenal work in promoting creative thinking
& Entrepreneurship worldwide. Students from the US and all around Europe
flock to this university to learn through an education which provides a
different platform,',   ', making them
entrepreneurs of thinking. It did surprise me that thinking in itself can',   ', be used as a product for economic enhancement
& stability. The ambiance of the university has high level of cultural
diversity and thought process which encourages utility & entrepreneurship.',   ', My experience with the university enriched me
as I interacted with students, faculty & management. I am sure that this
visit has been very meaningful and I will be able to operate with more creative
perspectives. ',

', 
', 
', 
', 
', 
', 
', 
', 
', 
', 
', 
', 
', 
', 
', 
', I extend gratitude to Dr. MPS World School and management
for encouragement & sponsorship of the same.

Principal   (Dr. MPS World School Agra)',

LEADERS CONFERENCE, New Delhi.',

', 
', 
', 
', 
', At the very onset I would like to draw your attention to my key words
of the Topic and that is Effective learning. The world learning in itself was a
paradigm shift that modern educators evolved to the process of education.  We then added the word effective to multiply
its efficacy. ', 
', 
', The use of computers or the digitalization of Education because it is a
new industry and permeates our life should not be the reason for incorporating
it in the effective learning process. The second danger I perceive that it
should not do more harm than good. If it teaches students to learn more that
they can handle then our problems will be manifold. As educators we know to
unlearn is more difficult to learn. The third important hurdle or angle that
must be taken into consideration is the financial aspect. Will the usability of
digitalization be cost effective? I must remind the august gathering here of
the kind of marketing that is done by the digital content vendors in term of
software and hardware.  The cleverly
marketed product is pressed down on educators by a whole team of carefully
manicured marketing strategist. The educators may fall prey to the glamour of
digitalization without fully comprehending its utility. I have been exposed to
redundant and terribly slow products that kill the creativity but have been
installed as a marketing strategy to display on billboards. Having cleared my
conscience on the predicament at hand I launch it to the plethora of using
cyber space to enhance effective learning processes. ', 
', 
', Learning is a process of self evolving depending upon the needs of the facilitators
as well as the learners. The word facilitator may please be read as advance
learner. Have mutually agreed that every learner has his /her own space and
pace the digital content actually adds true meaning to the classroom that caters
to all with its limited restricted environment and usually generalized the
learning capabilities. The Digital content acts as a highway on the journey of
self exploration. Once a teacher has enabled the students to relish the Solar System.
The student only needs the IT tools to quench his or her thirst on the topic.
These tools will work in the same way for all subjects. Our education system
had given very little importance to research in the early stages of learning. IT
efficacy will help students to network with all possibilities to enhance their capabilities
and will enrich classrooms with added information. ', 
', 
', 
', The Cyber world may also give unlimited space to exhibit talent and
vent ideas. Classrooms may take on a completely new meaning as learners may create
classrooms of their own without limitation of geographical boundaries. The
possibilities are immense but let us not throttle the possibilities due to any
fears of danger of the cyber space. As humans we are known for our adaptability
and the cyberspace is going to be no exception. Let me end by saying unless we
do not explore we will not  break new
ground.  ',
