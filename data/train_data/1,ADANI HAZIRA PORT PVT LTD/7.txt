', Hazira Port Pvt Ltd (HPPL) - a joint venture of Shell BV and Gaz De France - operates a LNG terminal at Hazira Port under a concession agreement signed with the government of Gujarat in 2002.', [1]', 
', Background', 
', Adani's website states, "In the year 2002, Hazira Port Concession Agreement (CA) was signed between the Gujarat Maritime Board, The Government of Gujarat and Hazira Port Private Limited. Construction of an LNG import terminal at Hazira started in April 2002. The LNG terminal with an initial capacity to handle about 2.0 MMTPA (Phase1A) shall be expanded to a long-term throughput of 10.0 MMTPA. Adani Hazira Port Pvt Ltd (AHPPL) will operate all non-LNG facilities in Hazira Port under the terms of the agreement with Hazira Port Pvt. Ltd. (HPPL). The port development plan includes the long-term port development with non-LNG cargo terminals (container and bulk terminals, and a proposed liquid terminal). LNG Terminal will continue to be operated by HLPL. In the future, both entities together will constitute the Hazira Port. AHPPL has commenced operations in first quarter of 2012. 5 Berths with annual capacity of 35 million tonnes has been developed and operated as part of the first phase. Out of the 5 berths, 2 will cater for the containers, 1 for coal and 2 berth will be used as a multi-purpose terminal for handling vessels of sizes varying from 80,000 DWT to 150,000 DWT. The relevant and required back up yard along with the Material handling systems is in place to support the operations." When fully developed the port is planned to have 13 berths & annual capacity to handle 75 million tonnes.', [1]', 
', According to the EIA (environmental impact assessment) report for Adani's new Hazira Port facility, filed in February 2012, "Phase 1A was already been developed for handling LNG cargo by HPPL. While developing approved Phase 1B, AHPPL is seeking EC for minor alteration in basin, liquid cargo handling with storage facilities, other dry and general cargo, Ro-Ro terminal for automobile handling, deepening of channel and supporting infrastructure facilities with additional arterial road network connecting to NH-6 and internal road, rail connectivity to all terminals and HT Power Transmission line. As per 15 year Master Plan of AHPPL, Adani Hazira Port shall have 12 multipurpose berths which consist of Container berth (4 Nos), Coal berth (2 Nos), other dry bulk cargo berth (2 Nos), Liquid berth (3 Nos) and Automobile berth (1 Ro-Ro berth). Phase 1B which is part of first 5 year development plan includes 7 berth such as Container berth (2 Nos), Coal berth (1 No), Liquid berth (1 No), Multipurpose berth (3 No). The other development includes deepening and maintenance of channel, basin and jetty sites with (-) 15 m CD draft, back-up facilities like container yard, rail sidings, rail and truck loading facilities, sea water intake and marine outfall facilities."', [3]', 
', u"Although the EIA speaks of seven berths to be developed in the project's first phase, Adani's website only mentions five berths.", [1]', u" However, both sources agree that a single coal berth will be included in the port's initial phase.", 
', u"In May 2013 India's Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) granted environmental and coastal regulation zone approval for Adani's proposed project (including the multi-cargo port, supporting utilities, and infrastructure facilities).", [2]', 
', u"According to press reports, Adani's Hazira container terminal and liquid bulk terminal began operating in 2012", [4]',  and 2013', [5]', , respectively. However, as of February 2015, there are still no indications that the Hazira coal terminal has been commissioned.', 
', 2016: Environmental permit revoked', 
', In an order dated January 8, 2016, the National Green Tribunal held that the environmental clearance granted to the dry and liquid port project in 2013 by the Ministry of Environment and Forest, is "illegal and must be set aside." The tribunal passed its order on a petition filed by Hazira Fishermen Committee that challenged the project on the grounds of damaging the ecology and displacing more than 300 poor fishermen families. The NGT also imposed a heavy penalty of Rs. 25 crore for restoration of environment that has been degraded: "What we find from the record is that instead of expanding port work in phase-out manner, expansion was already practically done almost without obtaining environmental clearance and coastal regulation zone (CEZ) clearance." The NGT went on to write that "It is evident from the affidavit of the forest department that this area, which once had abundance of mangrove stretches, presently don\u2019t have any mangrove vegetation."', [6]',
