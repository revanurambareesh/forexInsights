Management's Discussion & Analysis 

Macro-Economic Environment

ECONOMY: REVIEW AND OUTLOOK

The current macro-economic environment is passing through a severe slowdown 
led  by weakening in investment activity. Indeed, GDP is tepid around  6.5% 
in FY12, compared to a healthy ~8.4% in FY11. While the fall in consumption 
also  played  a  part in slowdown, the investment  decline  was  much  more 
pronounced.   Worryingly,  this  trend  of  disproportionate   decline   in 
investments is being witnessed for the last 3-4 years (post-Lehman crisis). 
This  does not augur well for the long-term growth of the country, as,  low 
rate of investment means lower growth in the coming years. The key  reasons 
that led to a slump in investments are:

a) Elevated inflation: Inflation concerns continued in FY12 (third year  in 
a  row)  as  demand pressures rose  significantly,  especially  in  H1FY12. 
Elevated  levels of inflation led to aggressive monetary tightening by  RBI 
and  this  had an adverse impact on investment and growth.  Moreover,  high 
inflation also had undesirable impact on savings rates and brought about an 
increase  in business uncertainty. However, easing of inflation  (specially 
on  demand  side)  in  Q4FY12 provided much needed  relief  and  barring  a 
deficient  monsoon  or  a spike in global commodity  prices,  inflation  is 
likely to be contained from present levels in FY13. Interestingly, RBI also 
appears to be reconciled to having a higher inflation rate of 6.5% in  FY13 
compared  to  their  earlier  comfort zone of 5%  or  lower.  Recent  data, 
however, unfortunately, again indicates rise in inflation.

b)  Tight  monetary  policy: Throughout H1FY12, RBI was  in  an  aggressive 
tightening mode to contain demand pressures in the economy. Accordingly, on 
a couple of occasions, RBI increased the policy rate by 50 bps rather  than 
a calibrated 25 bps hike. This aggressive tightening in monetary policy led 
to  significant  constriction  of the overall  monetary  condition  in  the 
economy.  Moreover,  excessively tight liquidity also led to  hardening  of 
money market rates. This, in turn, slowed down investments during the year.

However,  in  Q4FY12,  acknowledging the slowdown in  inflation  and  tight 
monetary  conditions,  RBI  began easing and slashing the CRR  by  125  bps 
followed  by an aggressive, and surprising to some, repo rate cut in  April 
2012.  In FY13, RBI is expected to continue to ease, albeit at  slow  pace, 
which  in  turn  is  expected to improve  the  investment  sentiments.  The 
downside risk to this scenario may be a truant monsoon or a spike in  crude 
prices.

c)  Decline  in  business  confidence: One of the  major  reasons  for  the 
investment  cycle  slowing  down is the  significant  erosion  of  business 
confidence. Due to a slew of corruption charges, government too went into a 
shell  and dithered from taking important policy actions, eroding  business 
confidence  further. Overall, this resulted in the businesses holding  back 
capex  plans  due  to lack of approvals/clarity  in  a  weakened  political 
setting. However, towards the end of FY12, government realised the  gravity 
of  the  issue and is now trying to address it. To what  extent  government 
supports investment in FY13 would be a key variable that will determine the 
extent of growth.

d)  Slippages  in  fiscal  and Current  Account  Deficit  (CAD):  FY12  saw 
significant  slippages  in fiscal deficit (~1.1% of GDP) as  the  subsidies 
overshot  budgeted  amount. This elevated fiscal deficit  had  a  cascading 
impact on inflation, growth and interest rates. Meanwhile, CAD is likely to 
be  a record ~4.0% of GDP in FY12 and played a major role in rupee's  slide 
during  H2FY12.  The  major  reason for the widening of  CAD  in  FY12  was 
petroleum  and gold imports. In the coming year, we expect gold imports  to 
normalise due to various measures taken by government and accordingly,  CAD 
is expected to contract from the elevated levels of FY12.

e)  Global developments: The worsening of the domestic  economic  condition 
was  exacerbated by continued global uncertainties, including the  Eurozone 
sovereign  debt  crisis and a weak U.S. recovery.  This  affected  investor 
confidence, making them risk-averse and reassess their allocation to India. 
As  a  result, capital inflows in India remained subdued in 9MFY12  with  a 
brief improvement in the last quarter. The Fll sentiments were again dented 
due to certain budgetary provisions related to foreign investments,  though 
some of these have been rolled back in May 2012. Trends in capital flows in 
coming  quarters,  therefore, will largely depend on  global  and  domestic 
economic  and financial conditions, including the pace of  domestic  policy 
reforms.

CAPITAL MARKETS

With  the  country facing a host of challenges in the economic  front,  the 
Indian capital markets and India as a favoured investment destination  lost 
a lot of shine during FY12. As a result, the markets went through extremely 
challenging  times for most part of FY12 and finally under  performed  most 
other  markets  for  the year despite a rally in  the  closing  stages.  As 
mentioned above.

with  investment climate being uncertain, most corporates put  their  capex 
plans on the backburner with the result that primary market equity  raising 
and  other  investment  banking activities  like  mergers  and  acquisition 
slumped. We believe FY12 was one of the toughest years in recent memory for 
capital markets. However, with economic conditions improving gradually,  we 
see  the year ahead of us as better than FY12 though there is no scope  for 
undue  euphoria or optimism. We see growth returning slowly in the  capital 
markets in the latter half of FY13.

With increased financialisation of the commodities market that has  already 
happened in developed markets and India now catching up, we see commodities 
along  with  bonds  as an asset class that will  grow  significantly  going 
forward and deepen the markets.

We expect the regulators and government to continue to work towards  policy 
liberalisation  and structural reforms bringing in higher efficiencies  and 
growth in markets. Despite a lower growth projection for India for FY13, we 
expect  the  Indian economy to out perform most developed  economies.  This 
should  ensure  a  reasonable growth in the capital  markets,  throwing  up 
exciting business opportunities. Forward-looking organisations would  think 
ahead and place themselves in the right place to catch these opportunities.

EMERGING MARKETS

FY12  was  a  lacklustre  year  for  equities.  The  general  risk   averse 
environment  resulted in a market slump in most of the countries.  However, 
the  developed world outperformed emerging markets with the U.S. and  Japan 
posting positive returns, despite the U.S. losing its AAA rating. Among the 
emerging markets, China, Russia and India were among the worst  performers. 
While  the  first  three quarters were abysmal, Q4FY12  witnessed  a  brief 
recovery.  ECB's actions for liquidity easing were a game changer  propping 
up  risk  assets globally. Ample liquidity was on offer  from  other  major 
central  banks as well. Consequently, India witnessed a  tremendous  Q4FY12 
with  net  F11 flows topping $8 billion. F11 flows in FY13,  however,  will 
depend  on  global and domestic conditions, including  how  the  government 
addresses  foreign  investors'  concerns  arising  out  of  recent   budget 
proposals covering foreign investment.

COMMERCIAL CREDIT MARKETS

The  commercial banks' non-food credit growth came in relatively weaker  in 
FY12  around  17%  as against 21% in FY11.  Prolonged  period  of  elevated 
interest  rates  coupled with slowing investment demand  resulted  in  this 
muted credit growth. Significant slowdown came in the Services sector  with 
growth coming off from 24% last year to 15% in FY12. However, over the last 
two  decades, bank credit has grown at an impressive CAGR of 21%  remaining 
the  main  source of debt capital in India. This is also supported  by  the 
non-banking  credit in India which grew at a higher CAGR of 26%, due  to  a 
smaller base, in the past 5 years. The non-bank credit growth thus presents 
large and growing opportunity in both corporate and retail finance.

DEBT MARKETS

Developing  the bond markets with an objective of attaining the  depth  and 
activity level observed in the equity markets continues to be among the top 
priorities of the RBI & SEBI. This effort got a significant boost this year 
as  fixed  income emerged as a powerful asset class during  a  period  when 
equities suffered due to a host of global and domestic concerns. The  space 
for  foreign investment in local currency bonds was widened to  accommodate 
the FII investment demand - the limits were increased by $5 billion each in 
the  government  and  corporate debt categories  while  the  infrastructure 
category  limits  were  hiked  to $20 billion. The  FII  appetite  is  also 
exemplified  in the unprecedented $10 billion of net foreign  inflows  into 
Indian  bonds. FY13 may see another round of increased limit allocation  to 
Flls depending on the utilisation of existing limits in the government  and 
corporate debt segments.

However,  some  of the major initiatives like Treasury bill  interest  rate 
futures,  corporate bond repos and credit default swaps have not taken  off 
at  the  expected pace. These are crucial to the overall progress  of  debt 
markets  and should develop along expected lines in due course as and  when 
regulations open up these segments to a broader class of participants.

Indian economy hinges on infrastructure growth and to this effect, tax-free 
infra-bonds  and  other public issuances have been  useful  capital-raising 
tools  for government-backed companies as well as an attractive  investment 
opportunity  for  institutional  and  retail  investors.  Retail   investor 
interest  in these issues has been a highlight for the year and  attracting 
further  participation  from  this voluminous segment will be  the  key  in 
transforming  the  Indian  debt  market landscape.  The  Union  Budget  has 
recognised  this  fact  and doubled the permissible  quota  under  tax-free 
infra-bonds  from   Rs.  300 billion to  Rs. 600 billion for  FY13.  It  is 
expected  that corporate India too should latch on to this avenue with  the 
advent of required structural reforms, thereby attracting a wider  investor 
base and deepening the corporate bond market.

Edelweiss Overview

A FULLY DIVERSIFIED FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP 

Edelweiss  Financial Services Limited, incorporated in 1995, started  as  a 
niche  Investment  Banker with focus on private equity advisory.  Over  the 
last  16  years,  Edelweiss Group has constantly  followed  a  strategy  of 
synergistic  diversification into adjacent markets, asset  classes,  client 
segments and products to build a fully diversified financial services group 
with a portfolio of cutting-edge high growth businesses covering most parts 
of  the  financial services space. These diverse businesses  are  conducted 
through an organisational structure consisting of 44 subsidiaries and seven 
associate  companies. We have a presence through 241 offices (including  18 
franchisee-led  and three international offices) in 120 major cities as  on 
March 31, 2012.

ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE

At Edelweiss, we have spent the last decade building our product lines  and 
managing our growth. As we pursue more business opportunities, as the  firm 
grows and becomes more complex, we have to ensure that we remain  efficient 
and effective. This requires constant effort towards organisation building, 
leadership  growth  and  sharpening  our  backend  systems,  processes  and 
technologies.  Further,  as our client base gets larger, more  diverse  and 
geographically   spread,  we  must  find  newer  ways  of   meeting   their 
expectations  in an innovative, sustainable and consistent manner  as  also 
identify and control newer risks.

To  meet  these  future challenges, we have  organised  the  businesses  of 
Edelweiss  around  five  broad business groups  -Credit  including  Housing 
Finance, Capital Markets & Asset Management, Commodities, Treasury and Life 
Insurance. Each of these five business groups is, in turn, organised around 
Strategic Business Units (SBUs) catering to a specific vertical within  the 
business group, based on commonality of business drivers, client  segments, 
resources and backend support required. Finally, each SBU comprises several 
lines or sub-lines of businesses (LoBs) to impart greater focus on customer 
centricity and performance evaluation of their specific business.

These  five  business  groups are controlled and supported  by  a  core  of 
Enterprise Groups that provide consistent quality and rigor to key  process 
functions. These groups focus on improving efficiency and productivity  and 
improve  our  ability  to deal with increasing complexity.  As  a  part  of 
organisation  build  out, we have also invested significantly in  our  risk 
management  policies,  processes, people and technology  under  the  Global 
Risk  Group  so that we are able to identify and measure risks  across  our 
diverse  businesses  in time and take appropriate  mitigating  measures  to 
preserve our capital and reputation.

Our  organisational  structure is nimble and flexible. While all  the  SBUs 
will  drive  synergies  as  well as address common  needs,  at  an  overall 
Edelweiss  level  there  is oneness on key areas  such  as  value  systems, 
culture, long-term strategy and allocation of key resources.

EDELWEISS STRATEGY

Ever since its inception, Edelweiss has successfully followed the  strategy 
of  synergistic  diversification while focusing on  people,  processes  and 
structure.  This strategy has been well demonstrated by the  resilience  of 
our  business model across cycles, as, despite severe economic downturn  in 
the  recent  past, Edelweiss has recorded significant  improvement  in  its 
topline  by  adding  newer  lines of businesses. At  the  core,  our  broad 
strategy,  which has resulted in our success over the years,  has  remained 
tied to the following cardinal tenets:

* Pursue new opportunities and grow in adjacent spaces

*  Diversify  Revenue  Streams and ensure a balanced mix  of  revenue  from 
various businesses

* Ensure a strong and liquid Balance Sheet with a reasonable leverage

* Focus on Cost Management

* Enable prudent risk taking and ensure robust risk management

* Support the business with strong enterprise functions

* Create a culture of leadership development

* Constantly invest in organisation building

As a result, Edelweiss has de-risked and reduced volatility by diversifying 
across  businesses  with a large range of products  and  services  covering 
multiple  asset classes and consumer segments. We have created a  portfolio 
of scalable and high growth businesses by expanding our addressable  market 
segments, client segments and geographies. We have a core leadership  team, 
a  broad array of products and services, strong financial underpinnings,  a 
brand  that  is  well recognised and most of all: clients who  want  to  do 
business  with us. Following this broad strategy, while the environment  in 
the recent past has been challenging and affecting the bottomline, we  have 
been  able  to grow our share in the financial services  industry  in  both 
relative and absolute terms.

To aptly reflect this diversified nature of the businesses of Edelweiss and 
the transition to a financial services firm from a capital market-led firm, 
the  shareholders  of  the  company approved a  change  in  the  name  from 
Edelweiss  Capital Limited to Edelweiss Financial Services Limited  in  the 
last Annual General Meeting held on July 25, 2011. Following the  approvals 
of the regulators, the change was effected on August 9, 2011. The  renaming 
vindicates  our  breadth of strength and opportunity  besides  marking  the 
beginning  of  the next phase of ourjourney of growth. In  line  with  this 
change  in  our  name,  we also launched our  new  and  more  comprehensive 
corporate website www.edelweissfin.com.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS

After  the blockbuster year of 2007-08, global financial meltdown  resulted 
in  a sharp deterioration in the financial services industry. The  business 
climate  briefly  improved in early part of FY11 leading to  a  short-lived 
belief  that the growth was back. However, in the latter part of  FY11  and 
most  parts  of FY12, global developments around  Eurozone  sovereign  debt 
crisis  and  a weak U.S. recovery coupled with a host  of  domestic  issues 
vitiated the environment. This led to an even sharper deterioration in  the 
business  climate in India with most businesses witnessing  lower  activity 
levels  and sentiments getting affected by external forces. The  year  FY12 
thus  was  tough  in terms of environment and the  headwinds  most  of  our 
businesses had to battle.

In  addition,  we  at Edelweiss continued to follow our  core  strategy  of 
synergistic  diversification  and  continued to invest  in  incubating  new 
businesses  and infrastructure build-out for securing future growth.  As  a 
result,  while  we recorded a YoY growth of 17% in our total  revenue  this 
year,  the profit after tax and minority was affected and was lower by  45% 
over FY11. At the same time, over the last 10 years, our total revenue  has 
grown at a CAGR of 72% and the net profit has increased at a CAGR of 92% as 
at the end of FY12. Thus, our performance across market cycles demonstrates 
our  ability to withstand the impact of external forces and yet be able  to 
build  a  robust and agile firm that can exploit growth  opportunities  and 
turn them into business whenever they re-appear.

The  net  worth  of Edelweiss was  Rs.  28.75  billion  including  minority 
interest and  Rs. 26.36 billion excluding the minority interest as on March 
31, 2012. The Balance Sheet size was  Rs. 145 billion as on March 31, 2012.

Consolidated Financial Highlights for FY12

* Total Revenue of  Rs. 16,707 million (Rs.14,290 million for FY11)

* Profit after Tax of  Rs. 1,277 million (Rs.2,330 million for FY11)

* Diluted EPS of  Rs. 1.66 (Rs. 3.00 for FY11) (FV Rs.1)

The  Board  of Directors has recommended a final dividend of Rs.  0.30  per 
equity share (on a face value of  Rs. 1) for FY12, subject to the  approval 
of the members of the company at the ensuing Annual General Meeting. During 
the  year,  the Company had paid interim dividend of  Rs. 0.30  per  equity 
share (on a face value of Rs. 1).

BUSINESS INCOME HIGHLIGHTS

Of  the  five  business  groups of  Edelweiss,  Capital  Markets  and  Life 
Insurance businesses are agency businesses generating fees & commission and 
premium  income.  The  remaining three,  namely,  Credit,  Commodities  and 
Treasury  are capital-based businesses largely contributing to the  revenue 
by  way of interest and other capital-based income. Some of  these  capital 
businesses  also  generate fee & commission income while  executing  client 
transactions.

Capital Based Revenue

Following  the  growth  in our credit book  and  emergence  of  Commodities 
business  as an independent business, our capital-based  businesses  earned 
interest and treasury related revenue of  Rs. 13,387 million for FY12 ( Rs. 
10,150 million for FY11), a significant rise of 32% over the previous year. 
Out of this, interest income is  Rs. 10,661 million ( Rs. 7,553 million for 
FY11), up 41%, and the revenue from Treasury operations and investments  is  
Rs. 2,534 million ( Rs. 2,413 million for FY11).

With  the  growth in our capital-based businesses, the revenue  from  these 
businesses  has become more relevant for us. 80% of our total  revenue  now 
accrues from capital-based businesses compared to 72% in the previous year.

Continuing our efforts since FY11 with the scale up of the credit book this 
year,  interest on loans has now emerged as a major revenue stream  for  us 
and accounts for 26% of our total revenue for FY12.

Net Revenue

With growth in income from our capital-based businesses, the concept of Net 
Revenue  (net of interest cost) has become more appropriate to us. This  is 
because  interest cost, as with all Banks and large NBFCs,  should  reflect 
above  the  expenses  line.  On a net revenue  basis,  our  Agency  fee  8i 
commission  revenue  for the year is  Rs. 3,320 million while  the  Capital 
based  net revenue - net of interest cost, all the interest cost being  for 
capital revenue - is  Rs. 5,090 million with the total net revenue at   Rs. 
8,410 million for FY12. Thus, at the net revenue level, the Agency  revenue 
and Capital based net revenue contribute in a balanced mix. The strategy of 
de-risking our businesses and diversifying our revenue streams continues to 
stand in good stead for us.

Agency Fee & Commission

With  the environment turning challenging since the third quarter  of  FY11 
and  spilling  over into FY12, capital markets witnessed  lower  levels  of 
activity  during a large part of FY12. Broking, investment banking,  retail 
financial  products distribution, mutual funds and other agency  businesses 
across  industry  bore  the  brunt of the  downturn.  However,  our  agency 
businesses  performed in line with the markets, holding their market  share 
or  even improving it in certain lines of businesses (LoBs). We recorded  a 
fee & commission revenue of  Rs. 3,213 million for the year, a fall of  22% 
over  FY11 revenue of  Rs. 4,140 million. This included Broking  Income  of  
Rs.  1,543  million  ( Rs. 1,911 million for FY11),  down  20%,  Investment 
Banking  Fees  of Rs.411 million 1,117 million), down 63%, and  Advisory  & 
Other Feesof Rs.1,259 million ( Rs. 1,112 million), up 13% over FY11.

As  a  result of lower fee & commissions this year and a higher  growth  in 
capital-based  revenue, Agency businesses now account for 20% of our  total 
revenue this year compared to 28% in the previous year.

Premium from Life Insurance Business

Our  Life Insurance business was launched in second quarter of FY12 and  it 
recorded  a new business premium of Rs. 107 million for the year. With  the 
planned  scale up of this business, we expect this revenue stream  to  grow 
significantly going forward.

EXPENSES

Our total costs this year were  Rs. 14,720 million compared to  Rs.  10,790 
million  in FY11, an increase of 36%. Within the total cost, our  operating 
expenses  went up by 13% over FY11 level, employee cost went up by 15%  and 
finance cost went up by 56% in the same period.

As mentioned in the previous Annual Report, we had purchased our new office 
building, Edelweiss House, close to Bandra Kurla Complex (Mumbai) for  over  
Rs. 4 billion to consolidate all our businesses under one roof. The  impact 
of  higher depreciation on this was felt this year with  FY12  depreciation 
being   Rs. 422 million compared to  Rs. 204 million in the previous  year. 
While  we started progressively occupying the new building since  May  2011 
and completed the process by October 2011, we had to continue to occupy the 
earlier  leased  premises  for the intervening period too,  adding  to  our 
expenses.  Barring  two  locations,  we have  surrendered  all  the  leased 
premises  occupied  earlier  by  the businesses that  have  moved  over  to 
Edelweiss  House. The benefits of consolidating all our businesses  in  the 
Edelweiss  House  have  already started accruing to us  by  way  of  higher 
operational  efficiency  and its benefits on operating  costs  will  become 
clearer gradually.

Despite  economic downturn, we continued to invest in build-out of our  new 
and growth businesses and carried on hiring for some of the new  businesses 
like Life Insurance and Home Finance. We also continued to hire selectively 
in senior positions as a part of our firm building process. As a result, we 
added  about 460 employees during the year contributing partly to  the  15% 
escalation in our employee costs in FY12.

As  the interest rates in the economy rose higher during FY12  (RBI  raised 
rates  by  175 basis points in five stages) and a liquidity crunch  set  in 
during  the  second  half  of the year,  our  average  cost  of  borrowings 
increased  by  about 85 basis points. This, coupled with scale  up  of  our 
capital  based  businesses  during  the  year,  led  to  our  finance  cost 
increasing by 56% in FY12 over FY11.

PROFIT AFTER TAX

Our Profit after Tax and Minority for FY12 was  Rs. 1,277 million  compared 
to Rs.2,330 million for FY11.

ANALYSIS OF PROFITABILITY

Our results for the year demonstrate a significant growth in topline as  an 
outcome  of the diversification strategy that we have actively pursued.  At 
the same time, we have been able to limit the impact of difficult operating 
conditions on the bottomline. Our results for the year need to be viewed in 
the backdrop of the following factors:

*  FY12 was one of the toughest years from the point of view  of  operating 
conditions  with high inflation and interest rates, liquidity crunch,  weak 
global  confidence and lower economic activity levels leading  to  industry 
revenue pool not growing. For some of the capital market activities such as 
broking or investment banking, the industry revenue pool in fact shrunk  in 
FY12.  The impact of lower earnings and higher cost of borrowings was  felt 
across our businesses.

*  Despite  marked  slowdown in the industry, we  continued  to  invest  in 
incubating our new businesses, namely, Life Insurance and Retail  platforms 
-Broking,  Housing Finance and AMC for long-term growth. Investment in  all 
these initiatives by way of build out cost passed through our Profit & Loss 
Account.

*  We  also  continued  to invest  in  upgrading  infrastructure,  such  as 
Edelweiss House and Fountainhead, our Leadership Centre, and technology  to 
meet the challenges of our fast growing firm. Higher depreciation on  these 
fixed assets also impacted our bottomline. In addition, certain investments 
such  as loan to our employee trust, which are currently  non-yielding  but 
long-term accretive, also caused a drag on our profitability.

*  These investments for securing future growth also present a  predicament 
of  balancing  short-term  growth  with long-term  growth  as  our  current 
bottomline  growth appears subdued. However, this is part of  the  learning 
and  growing process and we will continue to take prudent decisions in  the 
best interest of your company.

All these factors, therefore, have affected our bottom line and margins for 
the  year.  While some of the businesses under incubation are  expected  to 
break  even  in  FY13,  the costs associated with  scale  up  of  insurance 
business  will be higher going forward as per plan. Thus, we will  continue 
to  be  in  an  investment phase for some more time  infuture  and  as  the 
operating  landscape  is not likely to improve significantly, at  least  in 
H1FY13,  our margins are likely to remain under pressure in FY13  as  well. 
However,  the good news is that despite these challenges,  our  established 
businesses  have  held on to their market share and our  growth  businesses 
have even improved the market share in some instances.

Our Profit before Tax margin for the year was 12% and the Profit after  Tax 
margin 8%. Since a larger share of revenue is now coming from the  capital-
based  businesses (80%), the profit margins are now aligned with  those  of 
the banking and large NBFCs industry.

BUSINESS PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS

Credit Business

Our  Credit  business group includes Wholesale Finance SBU and  the  Retail 
Finance  SBU. The wholesale financing business SBU, the CFI SBU,  comprises 
Corporate  Finance,  Fixed  Income  Advisory  (including  Syndication   and 
Restructuring),  Fixed  Income Markets (including  Debt  Capital  Markets), 
Episodic  Financing  and Real Estate Finance LoBs. The Retail  Finance  SBU 
encompasses LoBs such as housing loans, loan against property (LAP),  lease 
rental discounting (LRD), SME Finance and other collateralised Retail loans 
such  as  loan against shares, loan against ESOPs and  IPO  financing.  The 
sponsors  of mid-to-large corporates constitute key clientele besides  HNI, 
retail and SME clients.

Edelweiss  had  launched the wholesale financing business in 2007  and  has 
come a long way having evolved and diversified into many different,  though 
interdependent, lines of businesses. The re-organisation of CFI SBU on  the 
above lines will enable us to capture opportunities across the entire fixed 
income domain by harnessing energies between the principal and agency sides 
of this business.

Similarly, the Retail Finance SBU will be able to draw synergies across the 
large  retail  segments  together with other  similarly  grouped  lines  of 
businesses.  Given  the  exciting prospects of home  mortgage  business  in 
India,  we  expect  the housing finance LoB of this SBU to  emerge  as  the 
dominant part going forward.

Business Update

With  equity  capital raising taking a back seat,  debt  markets  presented 
better  opportunities for scale up of Credit business in FY12.  Outstanding 
loans  reached a level of  Rs. 39.56 billion as on March 31, 2012  compared 
to   Rs.  26.53  billion as on March 31, 2011, a growth of  49%.  The  book 
comprised  of  wholesale loans of  Rs. 27.97 billion and  retail  loans  of 
Rs.11.59  billion. The retail book included housing finance loans and  LAP, 
which  crossed   Rs. 7.76 billion by the end of this  year.  Wholesale  and 
retail loans now constitute 71% and 29% respectively of the credit book.

FY12  saw very few IPOs restricting opportunities for  episodic  financing. 
However,  the last quarter did see a large IPO of MCX. In addition,  retail 
bond  issues  by  infrastructure  companies  also  evinced  good   interest 
presenting  financing  opportunities  for  HNI  and  retail  segments.   We 
accordingly  extended episodic financing of about  Rs. 47 billion  for  the 
year including  Rs. 28 billion during the last quarter.

The interest income from loans continued to be a significant revenue stream 
for  us.  However,  liquidity  crunch in the  system  and  persistent  high 
interest rates affected the growth of our Net Interest Income and  squeezed 
spreads  as borrowing costs rose more sharply. The impact worsened  in  the 
latter  half  of FY12 with short-term rates remaining above  the  long-term 
rates in an inverted yield pattern for some time.

The  average  collateral  cover in our  credit  book,  collateralised  with 
securities,  was  2.6 times as on March 31, 2012; the same  cover  was  2.6 
times  in  our wholesale book and 2.3 times in our retail  book  (excluding 
housing finance portfolio). We continue to enforce prudent risk  management 
policies to ensure that our capital is always preserved. As a part of  this 
policy,  we  also avoid undue sector/industry concentration in  our  credit 
book.

The  asset  quality  of  our  credit  book  broadly  continues  to   remain 
satisfactory.  However, with the investment climate worsening  and  markets 
being  volatile, there was some pressure on collateral cover for our  loans 
and  in  sporadic  cases, the delinquencies also went up.  The  gross  non-
performing  loans  thus  went up to  Rs. 226 million at  the  end  of  FY12 
compared  to  Rs. 116 million at the end of FY11. This implied a Gross  NPA 
ratio of 0.57% as on March 31, 2012 compared to 0.44% as on March 31, 2011. 
Our  net  NPA ratio is 0.17% as on March 31, 2012 compared to 0.08%  as  on 
March 31, 2011. We provide general loan loss reserve on standard assets  as 
per  the  RBI guidelines. Including this prudential  provision,  the  total 
provision cover on our Gross NPLs now stands at 116%.

ECL  Finance Limited, our NBFC subsidiary where the Edelweiss  Group  holds 
92% equity, enjoyed a Capital Adequacy Ratio of 24.6% as on March 31,  2012 
with  a net worth of  Rs. 12.98 billion. A strong capital base enables  the 
subsidiary  to  participate  in  reasonably  large  opportunities  in   the 
wholesale  financing  market within our laid down risk parameters  as  also 
access the market for resources easily.

Housing Finance

The  Indian  housing  finance  market,  currently  witnessing  a  very  low 
penetration, is expected to grow over four times by the end of this  decade 
given the young demographic profile that India enjoys and the fact that  it 
is the aspiration of every Indian to own a home. In addition, migration  of 
working  class  from rural to semi-urban and urban cities will  also  drive 
demand for housing in these cities. This business, therefore, presents vast 
opportunity  to  Edelweiss  for long-term  growth  together  with  designed 
diversification  in the revenue streams. This business, including  LAP,  is 
also  an integral part of our strategy to diversify our asset  classes  and 
cover a larger retail footprint together with significant opportunities  to 
cross-sell our other products to retail clients.

The  business launched in the third quarter of FY11 in Mumbai and  has  now 
expanded to include seven other major metros - the National Capital Region, 
Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Pune. Going forward, 
the  business will be extended to about 8-10 more major metros, which  will 
cover about 90% of the addressable market of India. By the end of the year, 
it  had built a book of  Rs. 7.76 billion achieving a handsome growth  over 
the FY11 end level of  Rs. 1.16 billion. This business follows conservative 
underwriting standards and has nil delinquencies.

Fixed Income Markets and Advisory

With  the inclusion of Fixed Income Markets and Advisory  businesses  under 
the CFI

SBU  structure,  we now bring together the origination  capabilities  along 
with  the relationships and underwriting capabilities to offer  a  one-stop 
solution for the end-to-end Debt requirements of our clients.

The year FY12 for Debt Markets was marked with the RBI carrying forward its 
tight  monetary regime into the first half of FY12 affecting  debt  capital

Management's Discussion & Analysis 

Macro-Economic Environment

ECONOMY: REVIEW AND OUTLOOK

The current macro-economic environment is passing through a severe slowdown 
led  by weakening in investment activity. Indeed, GDP is tepid around  6.5% 
in FY12, compared to a healthy ~8.4% in FY11. While the fall in consumption 
also  played  a  part in slowdown, the investment  decline  was  much  more 
pronounced.   Worryingly,  this  trend  of  disproportionate   decline   in 
investments is being witnessed for the last 3-4 years (post-Lehman crisis). 
This  does not augur well for the long-term growth of the country, as,  low 
rate of investment means lower growth in the coming years. The key  reasons 
that led to a slump in investments are:

a) Elevated inflation: Inflation concerns continued in FY12 (third year  in 
a  row)  as  demand pressures rose  significantly,  especially  in  H1FY12. 
Elevated  levels of inflation led to aggressive monetary tightening by  RBI 
and  this  had an adverse impact on investment and growth.  Moreover,  high 
inflation also had undesirable impact on savings rates and brought about an 
increase  in business uncertainty. However, easing of inflation  (specially 
on  demand  side)  in  Q4FY12 provided much needed  relief  and  barring  a 
deficient  monsoon  or  a spike in global commodity  prices,  inflation  is 
likely to be contained from present levels in FY13. Interestingly, RBI also 
appears to be reconciled to having a higher inflation rate of 6.5% in  FY13 
compared  to  their  earlier  comfort zone of 5%  or  lower.  Recent  data, 
however, unfortunately, again indicates rise in inflation.

b)  Tight  monetary  policy: Throughout H1FY12, RBI was  in  an  aggressive 
tightening mode to contain demand pressures in the economy. Accordingly, on 
a couple of occasions, RBI increased the policy rate by 50 bps rather  than 
a calibrated 25 bps hike. This aggressive tightening in monetary policy led 
to  significant  constriction  of the overall  monetary  condition  in  the 
economy.  Moreover,  excessively tight liquidity also led to  hardening  of 
money market rates. This, in turn, slowed down investments during the year.

However,  in  Q4FY12,  acknowledging the slowdown in  inflation  and  tight 
monetary  conditions,  RBI  began easing and slashing the CRR  by  125  bps 
followed  by an aggressive, and surprising to some, repo rate cut in  April 
2012.  In FY13, RBI is expected to continue to ease, albeit at  slow  pace, 
which  in  turn  is  expected to improve  the  investment  sentiments.  The 
downside risk to this scenario may be a truant monsoon or a spike in  crude 
prices.

c)  Decline  in  business  confidence: One of the  major  reasons  for  the 
investment  cycle  slowing  down is the  significant  erosion  of  business 
confidence. Due to a slew of corruption charges, government too went into a 
shell  and dithered from taking important policy actions, eroding  business 
confidence  further. Overall, this resulted in the businesses holding  back 
capex  plans  due  to lack of approvals/clarity  in  a  weakened  political 
setting. However, towards the end of FY12, government realised the  gravity 
of  the  issue and is now trying to address it. To what  extent  government 
supports investment in FY13 would be a key variable that will determine the 
extent of growth.

d)  Slippages  in  fiscal  and Current  Account  Deficit  (CAD):  FY12  saw 
significant  slippages  in fiscal deficit (~1.1% of GDP) as  the  subsidies 
overshot  budgeted  amount. This elevated fiscal deficit  had  a  cascading 
impact on inflation, growth and interest rates. Meanwhile, CAD is likely to 
be  a record ~4.0% of GDP in FY12 and played a major role in rupee's  slide 
during  H2FY12.  The  major  reason for the widening of  CAD  in  FY12  was 
petroleum  and gold imports. In the coming year, we expect gold imports  to 
normalise due to various measures taken by government and accordingly,  CAD 
is expected to contract from the elevated levels of FY12.

e)  Global developments: The worsening of the domestic  economic  condition 
was  exacerbated by continued global uncertainties, including the  Eurozone 
sovereign  debt  crisis and a weak U.S. recovery.  This  affected  investor 
confidence, making them risk-averse and reassess their allocation to India. 
As  a  result, capital inflows in India remained subdued in 9MFY12  with  a 
brief improvement in the last quarter. The Fll sentiments were again dented 
due to certain budgetary provisions related to foreign investments,  though 
some of these have been rolled back in May 2012. Trends in capital flows in 
coming  quarters,  therefore, will largely depend on  global  and  domestic 
economic  and financial conditions, including the pace of  domestic  policy 
reforms.

CAPITAL MARKETS

With  the  country facing a host of challenges in the economic  front,  the 
Indian capital markets and India as a favoured investment destination  lost 
a lot of shine during FY12. As a result, the markets went through extremely 
challenging  times for most part of FY12 and finally under  performed  most 
other  markets  for  the year despite a rally in  the  closing  stages.  As 
mentioned above.

with  investment climate being uncertain, most corporates put  their  capex 
plans on the backburner with the result that primary market equity  raising 
and  other  investment  banking activities  like  mergers  and  acquisition 
slumped. We believe FY12 was one of the toughest years in recent memory for 
capital markets. However, with economic conditions improving gradually,  we 
see  the year ahead of us as better than FY12 though there is no scope  for 
undue  euphoria or optimism. We see growth returning slowly in the  capital 
markets in the latter half of FY13.

With increased financialisation of the commodities market that has  already 
happened in developed markets and India now catching up, we see commodities 
along  with  bonds  as an asset class that will  grow  significantly  going 
forward and deepen the markets.

We expect the regulators and government to continue to work towards  policy 
liberalisation  and structural reforms bringing in higher efficiencies  and 
growth in markets. Despite a lower growth projection for India for FY13, we 
expect  the  Indian economy to out perform most developed  economies.  This 
should  ensure  a  reasonable growth in the capital  markets,  throwing  up 
exciting business opportunities. Forward-looking organisations would  think 
ahead and place themselves in the right place to catch these opportunities.

EMERGING MARKETS

FY12  was  a  lacklustre  year  for  equities.  The  general  risk   averse 
environment  resulted in a market slump in most of the countries.  However, 
the  developed world outperformed emerging markets with the U.S. and  Japan 
posting positive returns, despite the U.S. losing its AAA rating. Among the 
emerging markets, China, Russia and India were among the worst  performers. 
While  the  first  three quarters were abysmal, Q4FY12  witnessed  a  brief 
recovery.  ECB's actions for liquidity easing were a game changer  propping 
up  risk  assets globally. Ample liquidity was on offer  from  other  major 
central  banks as well. Consequently, India witnessed a  tremendous  Q4FY12 
with  net  F11 flows topping $8 billion. F11 flows in FY13,  however,  will 
depend  on  global and domestic conditions, including  how  the  government 
addresses  foreign  investors'  concerns  arising  out  of  recent   budget 
proposals covering foreign investment.

COMMERCIAL CREDIT MARKETS

The  commercial banks' non-food credit growth came in relatively weaker  in 
FY12  around  17%  as against 21% in FY11.  Prolonged  period  of  elevated 
interest  rates  coupled with slowing investment demand  resulted  in  this 
muted credit growth. Significant slowdown came in the Services sector  with 
growth coming off from 24% last year to 15% in FY12. However, over the last 
two  decades, bank credit has grown at an impressive CAGR of 21%  remaining 
the  main  source of debt capital in India. This is also supported  by  the 
non-banking  credit in India which grew at a higher CAGR of 26%, due  to  a 
smaller base, in the past 5 years. The non-bank credit growth thus presents 
large and growing opportunity in both corporate and retail finance.

DEBT MARKETS

Developing  the bond markets with an objective of attaining the  depth  and 
activity level observed in the equity markets continues to be among the top 
priorities of the RBI & SEBI. This effort got a significant boost this year 
as  fixed  income emerged as a powerful asset class during  a  period  when 
equities suffered due to a host of global and domestic concerns. The  space 
for  foreign investment in local currency bonds was widened to  accommodate 
the FII investment demand - the limits were increased by $5 billion each in 
the  government  and  corporate debt categories  while  the  infrastructure 
category  limits  were  hiked  to $20 billion. The  FII  appetite  is  also 
exemplified  in the unprecedented $10 billion of net foreign  inflows  into 
Indian  bonds. FY13 may see another round of increased limit allocation  to 
Flls depending on the utilisation of existing limits in the government  and 
corporate debt segments.

However,  some  of the major initiatives like Treasury bill  interest  rate 
futures,  corporate bond repos and credit default swaps have not taken  off 
at  the  expected pace. These are crucial to the overall progress  of  debt 
markets  and should develop along expected lines in due course as and  when 
regulations open up these segments to a broader class of participants.

Indian economy hinges on infrastructure growth and to this effect, tax-free 
infra-bonds  and  other public issuances have been  useful  capital-raising 
tools  for government-backed companies as well as an attractive  investment 
opportunity  for  institutional  and  retail  investors.  Retail   investor 
interest  in these issues has been a highlight for the year and  attracting 
further  participation  from  this voluminous segment will be  the  key  in 
transforming  the  Indian  debt  market landscape.  The  Union  Budget  has 
recognised  this  fact  and doubled the permissible  quota  under  tax-free 
infra-bonds  from   Rs.  300 billion to  Rs. 600 billion for  FY13.  It  is 
expected  that corporate India too should latch on to this avenue with  the 
advent of required structural reforms, thereby attracting a wider  investor 
base and deepening the corporate bond market.

Edelweiss Overview

A FULLY DIVERSIFIED FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP 

Edelweiss  Financial Services Limited, incorporated in 1995, started  as  a 
niche  Investment  Banker with focus on private equity advisory.  Over  the 
last  16  years,  Edelweiss Group has constantly  followed  a  strategy  of 
synergistic  diversification into adjacent markets, asset  classes,  client 
segments and products to build a fully diversified financial services group 
with a portfolio of cutting-edge high growth businesses covering most parts 
of  the  financial services space. These diverse businesses  are  conducted 
through an organisational structure consisting of 44 subsidiaries and seven 
associate  companies. We have a presence through 241 offices (including  18 
franchisee-led  and three international offices) in 120 major cities as  on 
March 31, 2012.

ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE

At Edelweiss, we have spent the last decade building our product lines  and 
managing our growth. As we pursue more business opportunities, as the  firm 
grows and becomes more complex, we have to ensure that we remain  efficient 
and effective. This requires constant effort towards organisation building, 
leadership  growth  and  sharpening  our  backend  systems,  processes  and 
technologies.  Further,  as our client base gets larger, more  diverse  and 
geographically   spread,  we  must  find  newer  ways  of   meeting   their 
expectations  in an innovative, sustainable and consistent manner  as  also 
identify and control newer risks.

To  meet  these  future challenges, we have  organised  the  businesses  of 
Edelweiss  around  five  broad business groups  -Credit  including  Housing 
Finance, Capital Markets & Asset Management, Commodities, Treasury and Life 
Insurance. Each of these five business groups is, in turn, organised around 
Strategic Business Units (SBUs) catering to a specific vertical within  the 
business group, based on commonality of business drivers, client  segments, 
resources and backend support required. Finally, each SBU comprises several 
lines or sub-lines of businesses (LoBs) to impart greater focus on customer 
centricity and performance evaluation of their specific business.

These  five  business  groups are controlled and supported  by  a  core  of 
Enterprise Groups that provide consistent quality and rigor to key  process 
functions. These groups focus on improving efficiency and productivity  and 
improve  our  ability  to deal with increasing complexity.  As  a  part  of 
organisation  build  out, we have also invested significantly in  our  risk 
management  policies,  processes, people and technology  under  the  Global 
Risk  Group  so that we are able to identify and measure risks  across  our 
diverse  businesses  in time and take appropriate  mitigating  measures  to 
preserve our capital and reputation.

Our  organisational  structure is nimble and flexible. While all  the  SBUs 
will  drive  synergies  as  well as address common  needs,  at  an  overall 
Edelweiss  level  there  is oneness on key areas  such  as  value  systems, 
culture, long-term strategy and allocation of key resources.

EDELWEISS STRATEGY

Ever since its inception, Edelweiss has successfully followed the  strategy 
of  synergistic  diversification while focusing on  people,  processes  and 
structure.  This strategy has been well demonstrated by the  resilience  of 
our  business model across cycles, as, despite severe economic downturn  in 
the  recent  past, Edelweiss has recorded significant  improvement  in  its 
topline  by  adding  newer  lines of businesses. At  the  core,  our  broad 
strategy,  which has resulted in our success over the years,  has  remained 
tied to the following cardinal tenets:

* Pursue new opportunities and grow in adjacent spaces

*  Diversify  Revenue  Streams and ensure a balanced mix  of  revenue  from 
various businesses

* Ensure a strong and liquid Balance Sheet with a reasonable leverage

* Focus on Cost Management

* Enable prudent risk taking and ensure robust risk management

* Support the business with strong enterprise functions

* Create a culture of leadership development

* Constantly invest in organisation building

As a result, Edelweiss has de-risked and reduced volatility by diversifying 
across  businesses  with a large range of products  and  services  covering 
multiple  asset classes and consumer segments. We have created a  portfolio 
of scalable and high growth businesses by expanding our addressable  market 
segments, client segments and geographies. We have a core leadership  team, 
a  broad array of products and services, strong financial underpinnings,  a 
brand  that  is  well recognised and most of all: clients who  want  to  do 
business  with us. Following this broad strategy, while the environment  in 
the recent past has been challenging and affecting the bottomline, we  have 
been  able  to grow our share in the financial services  industry  in  both 
relative and absolute terms.

To aptly reflect this diversified nature of the businesses of Edelweiss and 
the transition to a financial services firm from a capital market-led firm, 
the  shareholders  of  the  company approved a  change  in  the  name  from 
Edelweiss  Capital Limited to Edelweiss Financial Services Limited  in  the 
last Annual General Meeting held on July 25, 2011. Following the  approvals 
of the regulators, the change was effected on August 9, 2011. The  renaming 
vindicates  our  breadth of strength and opportunity  besides  marking  the 
beginning  of  the next phase of ourjourney of growth. In  line  with  this 
change  in  our  name,  we also launched our  new  and  more  comprehensive 
corporate website www.edelweissfin.com.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS

After  the blockbuster year of 2007-08, global financial meltdown  resulted 
in  a sharp deterioration in the financial services industry. The  business 
climate  briefly  improved in early part of FY11 leading to  a  short-lived 
belief  that the growth was back. However, in the latter part of  FY11  and 
most  parts  of FY12, global developments around  Eurozone  sovereign  debt 
crisis  and  a weak U.S. recovery coupled with a host  of  domestic  issues 
vitiated the environment. This led to an even sharper deterioration in  the 
business  climate in India with most businesses witnessing  lower  activity 
levels  and sentiments getting affected by external forces. The  year  FY12 
thus  was  tough  in terms of environment and the  headwinds  most  of  our 
businesses had to battle.

In  addition,  we  at Edelweiss continued to follow our  core  strategy  of 
synergistic  diversification  and  continued to invest  in  incubating  new 
businesses  and infrastructure build-out for securing future growth.  As  a 
result,  while  we recorded a YoY growth of 17% in our total  revenue  this 
year,  the profit after tax and minority was affected and was lower by  45% 
over FY11. At the same time, over the last 10 years, our total revenue  has 
grown at a CAGR of 72% and the net profit has increased at a CAGR of 92% as 
at the end of FY12. Thus, our performance across market cycles demonstrates 
our  ability to withstand the impact of external forces and yet be able  to 
build  a  robust and agile firm that can exploit growth  opportunities  and 
turn them into business whenever they re-appear.

The  net  worth  of Edelweiss was  Rs.  28.75  billion  including  minority 
interest and  Rs. 26.36 billion excluding the minority interest as on March 
31, 2012. The Balance Sheet size was  Rs. 145 billion as on March 31, 2012.

Consolidated Financial Highlights for FY12

* Total Revenue of  Rs. 16,707 million (Rs.14,290 million for FY11)

* Profit after Tax of  Rs. 1,277 million (Rs.2,330 million for FY11)

* Diluted EPS of  Rs. 1.66 (Rs. 3.00 for FY11) (FV Rs.1)

The  Board  of Directors has recommended a final dividend of Rs.  0.30  per 
equity share (on a face value of  Rs. 1) for FY12, subject to the  approval 
of the members of the company at the ensuing Annual General Meeting. During 
the  year,  the Company had paid interim dividend of  Rs. 0.30  per  equity 
share (on a face value of Rs. 1).

BUSINESS INCOME HIGHLIGHTS

Of  the  five  business  groups of  Edelweiss,  Capital  Markets  and  Life 
Insurance businesses are agency businesses generating fees & commission and 
premium  income.  The  remaining three,  namely,  Credit,  Commodities  and 
Treasury  are capital-based businesses largely contributing to the  revenue 
by  way of interest and other capital-based income. Some of  these  capital 
businesses  also  generate fee & commission income while  executing  client 
transactions.

Capital Based Revenue

Following  the  growth  in our credit book  and  emergence  of  Commodities 
business  as an independent business, our capital-based  businesses  earned 
interest and treasury related revenue of  Rs. 13,387 million for FY12 ( Rs. 
10,150 million for FY11), a significant rise of 32% over the previous year. 
Out of this, interest income is  Rs. 10,661 million ( Rs. 7,553 million for 
FY11), up 41%, and the revenue from Treasury operations and investments  is  
Rs. 2,534 million ( Rs. 2,413 million for FY11).

With  the  growth in our capital-based businesses, the revenue  from  these 
businesses  has become more relevant for us. 80% of our total  revenue  now 
accrues from capital-based businesses compared to 72% in the previous year.

Continuing our efforts since FY11 with the scale up of the credit book this 
year,  interest on loans has now emerged as a major revenue stream  for  us 
and accounts for 26% of our total revenue for FY12.

Net Revenue

With growth in income from our capital-based businesses, the concept of Net 
Revenue  (net of interest cost) has become more appropriate to us. This  is 
because  interest cost, as with all Banks and large NBFCs,  should  reflect 
above  the  expenses  line.  On a net revenue  basis,  our  Agency  fee  8i 
commission  revenue  for the year is  Rs. 3,320 million while  the  Capital 
based  net revenue - net of interest cost, all the interest cost being  for 
capital revenue - is  Rs. 5,090 million with the total net revenue at   Rs. 
8,410 million for FY12. Thus, at the net revenue level, the Agency  revenue 
and Capital based net revenue contribute in a balanced mix. The strategy of 
de-risking our businesses and diversifying our revenue streams continues to 
stand in good stead for us.

Agency Fee & Commission

With  the environment turning challenging since the third quarter  of  FY11 
and  spilling  over into FY12, capital markets witnessed  lower  levels  of 
activity  during a large part of FY12. Broking, investment banking,  retail 
financial  products distribution, mutual funds and other agency  businesses 
across  industry  bore  the  brunt of the  downturn.  However,  our  agency 
businesses  performed in line with the markets, holding their market  share 
or  even improving it in certain lines of businesses (LoBs). We recorded  a 
fee & commission revenue of  Rs. 3,213 million for the year, a fall of  22% 
over  FY11 revenue of  Rs. 4,140 million. This included Broking  Income  of  
Rs.  1,543  million  ( Rs. 1,911 million for FY11),  down  20%,  Investment 
Banking  Fees  of Rs.411 million 1,117 million), down 63%, and  Advisory  & 
Other Feesof Rs.1,259 million ( Rs. 1,112 million), up 13% over FY11.

As  a  result of lower fee & commissions this year and a higher  growth  in 
capital-based  revenue, Agency businesses now account for 20% of our  total 
revenue this year compared to 28% in the previous year.

Premium from Life Insurance Business

Our  Life Insurance business was launched in second quarter of FY12 and  it 
recorded  a new business premium of Rs. 107 million for the year. With  the 
planned  scale up of this business, we expect this revenue stream  to  grow 
significantly going forward.

EXPENSES

Our total costs this year were  Rs. 14,720 million compared to  Rs.  10,790 
million  in FY11, an increase of 36%. Within the total cost, our  operating 
expenses  went up by 13% over FY11 level, employee cost went up by 15%  and 
finance cost went up by 56% in the same period.

As mentioned in the previous Annual Report, we had purchased our new office 
building, Edelweiss House, close to Bandra Kurla Complex (Mumbai) for  over  
Rs. 4 billion to consolidate all our businesses under one roof. The  impact 
of  higher depreciation on this was felt this year with  FY12  depreciation 
being   Rs. 422 million compared to  Rs. 204 million in the previous  year. 
While  we started progressively occupying the new building since  May  2011 
and completed the process by October 2011, we had to continue to occupy the 
earlier  leased  premises  for the intervening period too,  adding  to  our 
expenses.  Barring  two  locations,  we have  surrendered  all  the  leased 
premises  occupied  earlier  by  the businesses that  have  moved  over  to 
Edelweiss  House. The benefits of consolidating all our businesses  in  the 
Edelweiss  House  have  already started accruing to us  by  way  of  higher 
operational  efficiency  and its benefits on operating  costs  will  become 
clearer gradually.

Despite  economic downturn, we continued to invest in build-out of our  new 
and growth businesses and carried on hiring for some of the new  businesses 
like Life Insurance and Home Finance. We also continued to hire selectively 
in senior positions as a part of our firm building process. As a result, we 
added  about 460 employees during the year contributing partly to  the  15% 
escalation in our employee costs in FY12.

As  the interest rates in the economy rose higher during FY12  (RBI  raised 
rates  by  175 basis points in five stages) and a liquidity crunch  set  in 
during  the  second  half  of the year,  our  average  cost  of  borrowings 
increased  by  about 85 basis points. This, coupled with scale  up  of  our 
capital  based  businesses  during  the  year,  led  to  our  finance  cost 
increasing by 56% in FY12 over FY11.

PROFIT AFTER TAX

Our Profit after Tax and Minority for FY12 was  Rs. 1,277 million  compared 
to Rs.2,330 million for FY11.

ANALYSIS OF PROFITABILITY

Our results for the year demonstrate a significant growth in topline as  an 
outcome  of the diversification strategy that we have actively pursued.  At 
the same time, we have been able to limit the impact of difficult operating 
conditions on the bottomline. Our results for the year need to be viewed in 
the backdrop of the following factors:

*  FY12 was one of the toughest years from the point of view  of  operating 
conditions  with high inflation and interest rates, liquidity crunch,  weak 
global  confidence and lower economic activity levels leading  to  industry 
revenue pool not growing. For some of the capital market activities such as 
broking or investment banking, the industry revenue pool in fact shrunk  in 
FY12.  The impact of lower earnings and higher cost of borrowings was  felt 
across our businesses.

*  Despite  marked  slowdown in the industry, we  continued  to  invest  in 
incubating our new businesses, namely, Life Insurance and Retail  platforms 
-Broking,  Housing Finance and AMC for long-term growth. Investment in  all 
these initiatives by way of build out cost passed through our Profit & Loss 
Account.

*  We  also  continued  to invest  in  upgrading  infrastructure,  such  as 
Edelweiss House and Fountainhead, our Leadership Centre, and technology  to 
meet the challenges of our fast growing firm. Higher depreciation on  these 
fixed assets also impacted our bottomline. In addition, certain investments 
such  as loan to our employee trust, which are currently  non-yielding  but 
long-term accretive, also caused a drag on our profitability.

*  These investments for securing future growth also present a  predicament 
of  balancing  short-term  growth  with long-term  growth  as  our  current 
bottomline  growth appears subdued. However, this is part of  the  learning 
and  growing process and we will continue to take prudent decisions in  the 
best interest of your company.

All these factors, therefore, have affected our bottom line and margins for 
the  year.  While some of the businesses under incubation are  expected  to 
break  even  in  FY13,  the costs associated with  scale  up  of  insurance 
business  will be higher going forward as per plan. Thus, we will  continue 
to  be  in  an  investment phase for some more time  infuture  and  as  the 
operating  landscape  is not likely to improve significantly, at  least  in 
H1FY13,  our margins are likely to remain under pressure in FY13  as  well. 
However,  the good news is that despite these challenges,  our  established 
businesses  have  held on to their market share and our  growth  businesses 
have even improved the market share in some instances.

Our Profit before Tax margin for the year was 12% and the Profit after  Tax 
margin 8%. Since a larger share of revenue is now coming from the  capital-
based  businesses (80%), the profit margins are now aligned with  those  of 
the banking and large NBFCs industry.

BUSINESS PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS

Credit Business

Our  Credit  business group includes Wholesale Finance SBU and  the  Retail 
Finance  SBU. The wholesale financing business SBU, the CFI SBU,  comprises 
Corporate  Finance,  Fixed  Income  Advisory  (including  Syndication   and 
Restructuring),  Fixed  Income Markets (including  Debt  Capital  Markets), 
Episodic  Financing  and Real Estate Finance LoBs. The Retail  Finance  SBU 
encompasses LoBs such as housing loans, loan against property (LAP),  lease 
rental discounting (LRD), SME Finance and other collateralised Retail loans 
such  as  loan against shares, loan against ESOPs and  IPO  financing.  The 
sponsors  of mid-to-large corporates constitute key clientele besides  HNI, 
retail and SME clients.

Edelweiss  had  launched the wholesale financing business in 2007  and  has 
come a long way having evolved and diversified into many different,  though 
interdependent, lines of businesses. The re-organisation of CFI SBU on  the 
above lines will enable us to capture opportunities across the entire fixed 
income domain by harnessing energies between the principal and agency sides 
of this business.

Similarly, the Retail Finance SBU will be able to draw synergies across the 
large  retail  segments  together with other  similarly  grouped  lines  of 
businesses.  Given  the  exciting prospects of home  mortgage  business  in 
India,  we  expect  the housing finance LoB of this SBU to  emerge  as  the 
dominant part going forward.

Business Update

With  equity  capital raising taking a back seat,  debt  markets  presented 
better  opportunities for scale up of Credit business in FY12.  Outstanding 
loans  reached a level of  Rs. 39.56 billion as on March 31, 2012  compared 
to   Rs.  26.53  billion as on March 31, 2011, a growth of  49%.  The  book 
comprised  of  wholesale loans of  Rs. 27.97 billion and  retail  loans  of 
Rs.11.59  billion. The retail book included housing finance loans and  LAP, 
which  crossed   Rs. 7.76 billion by the end of this  year.  Wholesale  and 
retail loans now constitute 71% and 29% respectively of the credit book.

FY12  saw very few IPOs restricting opportunities for  episodic  financing. 
However,  the last quarter did see a large IPO of MCX. In addition,  retail 
bond  issues  by  infrastructure  companies  also  evinced  good   interest 
presenting  financing  opportunities  for  HNI  and  retail  segments.   We 
accordingly  extended episodic financing of about  Rs. 47 billion  for  the 
year including  Rs. 28 billion during the last quarter.

The interest income from loans continued to be a significant revenue stream 
for  us.  However,  liquidity  crunch in the  system  and  persistent  high 
interest rates affected the growth of our Net Interest Income and  squeezed 
spreads  as borrowing costs rose more sharply. The impact worsened  in  the 
latter  half  of FY12 with short-term rates remaining above  the  long-term 
rates in an inverted yield pattern for some time.

The  average  collateral  cover in our  credit  book,  collateralised  with 
securities,  was  2.6 times as on March 31, 2012; the same  cover  was  2.6 
times  in  our wholesale book and 2.3 times in our retail  book  (excluding 
housing finance portfolio). We continue to enforce prudent risk  management 
policies to ensure that our capital is always preserved. As a part of  this 
policy,  we  also avoid undue sector/industry concentration in  our  credit 
book.

The  asset  quality  of  our  credit  book  broadly  continues  to   remain 
satisfactory.  However, with the investment climate worsening  and  markets 
being  volatile, there was some pressure on collateral cover for our  loans 
and  in  sporadic  cases, the delinquencies also went up.  The  gross  non-
performing  loans  thus  went up to  Rs. 226 million at  the  end  of  FY12 
compared  to  Rs. 116 million at the end of FY11. This implied a Gross  NPA 
ratio of 0.57% as on March 31, 2012 compared to 0.44% as on March 31, 2011. 
Our  net  NPA ratio is 0.17% as on March 31, 2012 compared to 0.08%  as  on 
March 31, 2011. We provide general loan loss reserve on standard assets  as 
per  the  RBI guidelines. Including this prudential  provision,  the  total 
provision cover on our Gross NPLs now stands at 116%.

ECL  Finance Limited, our NBFC subsidiary where the Edelweiss  Group  holds 
92% equity, enjoyed a Capital Adequacy Ratio of 24.6% as on March 31,  2012 
with  a net worth of  Rs. 12.98 billion. A strong capital base enables  the 
subsidiary  to  participate  in  reasonably  large  opportunities  in   the 
wholesale  financing  market within our laid down risk parameters  as  also 
access the market for resources easily.

Housing Finance

The  Indian  housing  finance  market,  currently  witnessing  a  very  low 
penetration, is expected to grow over four times by the end of this  decade 
given the young demographic profile that India enjoys and the fact that  it 
is the aspiration of every Indian to own a home. In addition, migration  of 
working  class  from rural to semi-urban and urban cities will  also  drive 
demand for housing in these cities. This business, therefore, presents vast 
opportunity  to  Edelweiss  for long-term  growth  together  with  designed 
diversification  in the revenue streams. This business, including  LAP,  is 
also  an integral part of our strategy to diversify our asset  classes  and 
cover a larger retail footprint together with significant opportunities  to 
cross-sell our other products to retail clients.

The  business launched in the third quarter of FY11 in Mumbai and  has  now 
expanded to include seven other major metros - the National Capital Region, 
Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Pune. Going forward, 
the  business will be extended to about 8-10 more major metros, which  will 
cover about 90% of the addressable market of India. By the end of the year, 
it  had built a book of  Rs. 7.76 billion achieving a handsome growth  over 
the FY11 end level of  Rs. 1.16 billion. This business follows conservative 
underwriting standards and has nil delinquencies.

Fixed Income Markets and Advisory

With  the inclusion of Fixed Income Markets and Advisory  businesses  under 
the CFI

SBU  structure,  we now bring together the origination  capabilities  along 
with  the relationships and underwriting capabilities to offer  a  one-stop 
solution for the end-to-end Debt requirements of our clients.

The year FY12 for Debt Markets was marked with the RBI carrying forward its 
tight  monetary regime into the first half of FY12 affecting  debt  capital
