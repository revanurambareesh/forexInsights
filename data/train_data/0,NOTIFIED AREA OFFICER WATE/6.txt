', Background', [', edit', ]', 
', Within the limits set by the ', U.S. Supreme Court',  in ', Tennessee v. Garner', , authority to use deadly force in the line of duty is granted by state law to state and local law enforcement agencies. Individual agencies set policies and procedures regarding when and how to use deadly force.', [8]',  The ruling in ', Tennessee v. Garner', u" determined that deadly force is not justifiable simply to prevent a fleeing suspect's escape if the suspect does not pose a significant threat of death or serious harm to others.", [9]', 
', When deadly force is used within the prescribed manner, the killing is deemed a ', justifiable homicide', . Some law enforcement agencies routinely investigate all uses of deadly force, while others investigate only cases involving extenuating circumstances. Other causes of death to suspects include accidents and ', police brutality', . When circumstances surrounding a death are questionable, the death may be investigated by a state or federal agency or both.', [10]',  Of the thousands of fatal police shootings from 2005 through 2015, 54 police officers were criminally charged as a result, and most of those officers were cleared or acquitted. According to a ', Washington Post',  report by Alice Crites and Steven Rich, officers who are convicted or plead guilty tend to get an average of four years of jail time, and sometimes only weeks.', [9]', 
', According to ', Amnesty International', , U.S. laws do not meet international ', human rights',  standards for use-of-force by law enforcement. Only eight states in the United States require a verbal warning by police officers before shooting.', [11]', 
', As of December 2015, researchers from ', Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health',  have called on U.S. public health agencies to consider police killings and police deaths ', public health',  issues. The summary points of their paper are:', [12]', 
', 
', During the past year, the United States has experienced major controversies\u2014and civil unrest\u2014regarding Blacks killed by police while resisting arrest.', 
', Although deaths of police officers are well documented, no reliable official U.S. data exist on the number of persons killed by the police, in part because of long-standing and well-documented resistance of police departments to making these data public.', 
', These deaths, however, are countable, as evidenced by "The Counted", a website launched on June 1, 2015, by the newspaper',  The Guardian', , published in the United Kingdom, which quickly revealed that over 500 people in the United States were killed by the police from January 1 to June 9, 2015, twice what would be expected based on estimates from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (', FBI', )', .', 
', Law-enforcement\u2013related deaths, of both persons killed by law enforcement agents and also law enforcement agents killed in the line of duty, are a public health concern, not solely a criminal justice concern, since these events involve ', mortality',  and affect the well-being of the families and communities of the deceased; therefore, law-enforcement\u2013related deaths are public health data, not solely criminal justice data', .', 
', 
', The authors also propose that "', law-enforcement\u2013related deaths be treated as a notifiable condition, which would allow public health departments to report these data in real-time, at the local as well as national level, thereby providing data needed to understand and prevent the problem', ".', 
', Government data collection', [', edit', ]', 
', Through the ', Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994', , specifically Section 210402, the U.S. Congress mandated that the ', attorney general',  collect data on the use of excessive force by police and publish an annual report from the data.', [13]',  However, the bill lacked provisions for enforcement.', [14]',  In part due to the lack of participation from state and local agencies, the Bureau of Justice Statistics stopped keeping count in March 2014.', [15]', 
', Two national systems collect data that include homicides committed by law enforcement officers in the line of duty. The ', National Center for Health Statistics',  maintains the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS), which aggregates data from locally filed death certificates. State laws require that death certificates be filed with local registrars, but the certificates do not systematically document whether a killing was legally justified nor whether a law enforcement officer was involved.', [16]', 
', The ', FBI',  maintains the ', Uniform Crime Reporting Program',  (UCR), which relies on state and local law enforcement agencies voluntarily submitting crime reports.', [16]',  A study of the years 1976 to 1998 found that both national systems underreport justifiable homicides by police officers, but for different reasons.', [16]', u" In addition, from 2007 to 2012, more than 550 homicides by the country's 105 largest law enforcement agencies were missing from FBI records.", [17]', 
', Records in the NVSS did not consistently include documentation of police officer involvement. The UCR database did not receive reports of all applicable incidents. The authors concluded that "reliable estimates of the number of justifiable homicides committed by police officers in the United States do not exist."', [16]',  A study of killings by police from 1999 to 2002 in the Central Florida region found that the national databases included (in Florida) only one-fourth of the number of persons killed by police as reported in the local news media.', [18]', "Nationally, the percentage of unreported killings by police is probably lower than among agencies in Central Florida..."', [18]', 
', The Death In Custody Reporting Act required states to report individuals who die in police custody. It was active without enforcement provisions from 2000 to 2006 and restored in December 2014, amended to include enforcement through withdrawal of federal funding for noncompliant departments.', [14]', 
', An additional bill requiring all American law enforcement agencies to report killings by their officers was introduced in the U.S. Senate in June 2015.', [19]', 
', According to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), based on data from medical examiners and coroners, killings by law enforcement officers (not including legal executions) was the most distinctive cause of death in Nevada, New Mexico, and Oregon from 2001 to 2010. In these states, the rate of killings by law enforcement officers was higher above national averages than any other cause of death considered.', [20]', [21]',  The database used to generate those statistics, the CDC WONDER Online Database, has a U.S. total of 5,511 deaths by "Legal Intervention" for the years 1999-2013 (3,483 for the years 2001-2010 used to generate the report) excluding the subcategory for legal execution.', [22]', 
', Crowd-sourced projects to collect data', [', edit', ]', 
', Mainly following public attention to police-related killings after several well-publicized cases in 2014 (e.g., ', Eric Garner', , ', Michael Brown', , and ', John Crawford III', ), several projects were begun to ', crowd-source',  data on such events. These include Fatal Encounters', [23]',  and U.S. Police Shootings Data at ', Deadspin', .', [24]',  Another project, the Facebook page "Killed by Police" (or webpage www.KilledbyPolice.net) tracks killings starting May 1, 2013.', [25]',  In 2015, CopCrisis used the KilledByPolice.net data to generate infographics about police killings.', [26]',  A project affiliated with ', Black Lives Matter', ,', [27]',  ', Mapping Police Violence', , tracks killings starting January 1, 2013, and conducts analyses and visualizations examining rates of killings by police department, city, state, and national trends over time. ', Mapping Police Violence',  found 1,209 people killed by police in 2015, including 346 black people and 102 unarmed black people.', [28]', 
', The National Police Misconduct Reporting Project, started in 2009 by David Packman, is now owned and operated by the Cato Institute. It covers a range of police behaviors.', [29]',  The most recent addition is The Puppycide Database Project, which collects information about police use of lethal force against animals, as well as people killed while defending their animals from police, or unintentionally while police were trying to kill animals.', [30]',

', These deaths, however, are countable, as evidenced by "The Counted", a website launched on June 1, 2015, by the newspaper',  The Guardian', , published in the United Kingdom, which quickly revealed that over 500 people in the United States were killed by the police from January 1 to June 9, 2015, twice what would be expected based on estimates from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (', FBI', )', .', 
', Law-enforcement\u2013related deaths, of both persons killed by law enforcement agents and also law enforcement agents killed in the line of duty, are a public health concern, not solely a criminal justice concern, since these events involve ', mortality',  and affect the well-being of the families and communities of the deceased; therefore, law-enforcement\u2013related deaths are public health data, not solely criminal justice data', .', 
', 
', The authors also propose that "', law-enforcement\u2013related deaths be treated as a notifiable condition, which would allow public health departments to report these data in real-time, at the local as well as national level, thereby providing data needed to understand and prevent the problem', ".', 
', Government data collection', [', edit', ]', 
', Through the ', Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994', , specifically Section 210402, the U.S. Congress mandated that the ', attorney general',  collect data on the use of excessive force by police and publish an annual report from the data.', [13]',  However, the bill lacked provisions for enforcement.', [14]',  In part due to the lack of participation from state and local agencies, the Bureau of Justice Statistics stopped keeping count in March 2014.', [15]', 
', Two national systems collect data that include homicides committed by law enforcement officers in the line of duty. The ', National Center for Health Statistics',  maintains the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS), which aggregates data from locally filed death certificates. State laws require that death certificates be filed with local registrars, but the certificates do not systematically document whether a killing was legally justified nor whether a law enforcement officer was involved.', [16]', 
', The ', FBI',  maintains the ', Uniform Crime Reporting Program',  (UCR), which relies on state and local law enforcement agencies voluntarily submitting crime reports.', [16]',  A study of the years 1976 to 1998 found that both national systems underreport justifiable homicides by police officers, but for different reasons.', [16]', u" In addition, from 2007 to 2012, more than 550 homicides by the country's 105 largest law enforcement agencies were missing from FBI records.", [17]', 
', Records in the NVSS did not consistently include documentation of police officer involvement. The UCR database did not receive reports of all applicable incidents. The authors concluded that "reliable estimates of the number of justifiable homicides committed by police officers in the United States do not exist."', [16]',  A study of killings by police from 1999 to 2002 in the Central Florida region found that the national databases included (in Florida) only one-fourth of the number of persons killed by police as reported in the local news media.', [18]', "Nationally, the percentage of unreported killings by police is probably lower than among agencies in Central Florida..."', [18]', 
', The Death In Custody Reporting Act required states to report individuals who die in police custody. It was active without enforcement provisions from 2000 to 2006 and restored in December 2014, amended to include enforcement through withdrawal of federal funding for noncompliant departments.', [14]', 
', An additional bill requiring all American law enforcement agencies to report killings by their officers was introduced in the U.S. Senate in June 2015.', [19]', 
', According to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), based on data from medical examiners and coroners, killings by law enforcement officers (not including legal executions) was the most distinctive cause of death in Nevada, New Mexico, and Oregon from 2001 to 2010. In these states, the rate of killings by law enforcement officers was higher above national averages than any other cause of death considered.', [20]', [21]',  The database used to generate those statistics, the CDC WONDER Online Database, has a U.S. total of 5,511 deaths by "Legal Intervention" for the years 1999-2013 (3,483 for the years 2001-2010 used to generate the report) excluding the subcategory for legal execution.', [22]', 
', Crowd-sourced projects to collect data', [', edit', ]', 
', Mainly following public attention to police-related killings after several well-publicized cases in 2014 (e.g., ', Eric Garner', , ', Michael Brown', , and ', John Crawford III', ), several projects were begun to ', crowd-source',  data on such events. These include Fatal Encounters', [23]',  and U.S. Police Shootings Data at ', Deadspin', .', [24]',  Another project, the Facebook page "Killed by Police" (or webpage www.KilledbyPolice.net) tracks killings starting May 1, 2013.', [25]',  In 2015, CopCrisis used the KilledByPolice.net data to generate infographics about police killings.', [26]',  A project affiliated with ', Black Lives Matter', ,', [27]',  ', Mapping Police Violence', , tracks killings starting January 1, 2013, and conducts analyses and visualizations examining rates of killings by police department, city, state, and national trends over time. ', Mapping Police Violence',  found 1,209 people killed by police in 2015, including 346 black people and 102 unarmed black people.', [28]', 
', The National Police Misconduct Reporting Project, started in 2009 by David Packman, is now owned and operated by the Cato Institute. It covers a range of police behaviors.', [29]',  The most recent addition is The Puppycide Database Project, which collects information about police use of lethal force against animals, as well as people killed while defending their animals from police, or unintentionally while police were trying to kill animals.', [30]',
