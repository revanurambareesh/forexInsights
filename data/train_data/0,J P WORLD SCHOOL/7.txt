', World School', 

', 
', The WorldSchool was initiated in 1997 by Masaki Matsudaira, the former Chairman and present advisor to the board of trustees at Kanto International School. Its aim is to create a truly borderless entity that will bring together high school students and teachers from all areas of the world for the purpose of helping the participants create their image of an ideal educational program. This program is designed to train students to adopt a global perspective by becoming receptive to differences and to enable them to form lasting friendships. In this way, we hope to prepare students of the WorldSchool to excel in globalized society, which we believe will gain prominence in the future.', 

', u"Since the program's initiation in 1997, the World School International Forums have received the kind moral support of the Japanese Ministry of Education, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the embassies and cultural representative offices of participating counties.", 

', The World School Mission', 
', In an increasingly interconnected world, we are forced to live and work in an environment that calls for a global perspective in all that we do.A rapid growth of technology has created a world where we must reach past our immediate cultural boundaries and behavioral patterns to include a set of standards that can help us to function in multiple cultural settings and in inter-disciplinary fields.To succeed in an international community means that we must continually stay in tuned to standards that are created, be a part of the creation process itself by demonstrating the ability to voice our own set of values in an international context and to incorporate the knowledge we gain by making what we learn about the world, a part of ourselves and a part of our lives.As international citizens we must learn all we can about the world by creating a network of friendships that constantly broaden our perspectives, and to adopt the attitude that as responsible globally minded leaders of our future, together all things are possible.',

', World School', 

', 
', The WorldSchool was initiated in 1997 by Masaki Matsudaira, the former Chairman and present advisor to the board of trustees at Kanto International School. Its aim is to create a truly borderless entity that will bring together high school students and teachers from all areas of the world for the purpose of helping the participants create their image of an ideal educational program. This program is designed to train students to adopt a global perspective by becoming receptive to differences and to enable them to form lasting friendships. In this way, we hope to prepare students of the WorldSchool to excel in globalized society, which we believe will gain prominence in the future.', 

', u"Since the program's initiation in 1997, the World School International Forums have received the kind moral support of the Japanese Ministry of Education, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the embassies and cultural representative offices of participating counties.", 

', The World School Mission', 
', In an increasingly interconnected world, we are forced to live and work in an environment that calls for a global perspective in all that we do.A rapid growth of technology has created a world where we must reach past our immediate cultural boundaries and behavioral patterns to include a set of standards that can help us to function in multiple cultural settings and in inter-disciplinary fields.To succeed in an international community means that we must continually stay in tuned to standards that are created, be a part of the creation process itself by demonstrating the ability to voice our own set of values in an international context and to incorporate the knowledge we gain by making what we learn about the world, a part of ourselves and a part of our lives.As international citizens we must learn all we can about the world by creating a network of friendships that constantly broaden our perspectives, and to adopt the attitude that as responsible globally minded leaders of our future, together all things are possible.',
