', Project Description', 

', The proposed Project involves a multi-level engagement and partnership with Acme Solar Energy Private Limited (\u201cACME Solar\u201d), a holding Company founded by ACME Tele Power to develop, construct and operate solar generation assets in India. ', 
', 
IFC is considering providing an overall envelope for debt funding in the amount of US$50 million, to be used over the next few years for various projects that ACME Solar is developing. The first tranche of this financing is expected to be provided to ACME Solar Energy (Madhya Pradesh) Private Limited (\u201cASEMPPL\u201d), a subsidiary of ACME Solar established to develop a 25 MW grid connected solar photovoltaic power plant in the State of Madhya Pradesh (MP), India (the \u201cProject\u201d). ASEMPPL has entered into a 25-year power purchase agreement (\u201cPPA\u201d) with MP Power Management Company and is estimated to supply 50 GWh per year. The deadline for commissioning is November 2013.Other projects that ACME Solar is developing, which IFC may consider for financing under the facility include solar projects in Odisha and Andhra Pradesh.',

Acme Solar Private Limited (\u2018Acme Solar\u2019) has been established to develop solar energy projects across India. Over the last 2 years, Acme Solar has established a track record in developing such projects by developing a 15MW photovoltaic plant in Gujarat and a 2.5 MW solar thermal plant in Rajasthan. By April 2013, ACME Solar is expected to be held 50% by Acme Cleantech Solutions Private Limited, 25% each by EDF Energies Nouvelles (EDF EN) and 25% by Société Internationale d\u2019Investissements Financiers  ENR (SIIF ENR).', 
', 
Acme Cleantech Solutions Private Limited (ACSL): Founded by Mr. Manoj Upadhyay in 2003, ACME Group has grown to become a leader in the field of energy, environmental and telecommunications infrastructure solutions in India.  Its main company is ACME Tele Power Ltd (\u201cATP\u201d), a leading provider of energy conservation and energy management solutions to leading telecom operators, including Bharti Infratel Ltd. (Airtel), Indus Towers, Vodafone, Aircel, Idea Cellular, Tata Teleservices and Reliance Communications. ACME Group has presence in over 15 countries, 2,000 employees and an installed base of more than 150,000 telecom towers globally.  It has 10 registered patents for energy conservation products and manufacturing capabilities in India.', 
', 
EDF EN is today regarded as a major global player in wind and solar photovoltaic power.  It has a total installed capacity of 5,372MW plus an additional 1,330MW under construction. Solar PV capacity is 492 MW operational with a further 203 MW under construction.  EDF EN is fully owned by Électricité de France S.A. which is the French state owned electricity utility and the second largest electric utility company in the world.', 
', 
SIIF is based in Luxembourg and employs a full-fledged team to manage its industrial and financial assets. SIIF and SIIF ENR have subsidiaries in France, Greece, Italy, Israel and a number of other countries. 85% of SIIF ENR is owned by SIIF Tech which is controlled by Mr. Pâris Mouratoglou and his family, the rest 15% is held by Mr. David Corcha who was the CEO of EDF EN until 2012.', 

', u"Total Project Cost and Amount and Nature of IFC's Investment", 

', IFC is considering an overall senior debt facility of US$ 50 million for various solar power farms to be developed over the next two years by Acme Solar. Out of the US$ 50 million facility, a local currency A loan of approximately US$ 12.5 million-equivalent is proposed for ACME Solar Energy (Madhya Pradesh) Private Limited to develop the 25 MW Madhya Pradesh project, which is expected to cost around US$ 36 million.',

', Project Description', 

', The proposed Project involves a multi-level engagement and partnership with Acme Solar Energy Private Limited (\u201cACME Solar\u201d), a holding Company founded by ACME Tele Power to develop, construct and operate solar generation assets in India. ', 
', 
IFC is considering providing an overall envelope for debt funding in the amount of US$50 million, to be used over the next few years for various projects that ACME Solar is developing. The first tranche of this financing is expected to be provided to ACME Solar Energy (Madhya Pradesh) Private Limited (\u201cASEMPPL\u201d), a subsidiary of ACME Solar established to develop a 25 MW grid connected solar photovoltaic power plant in the State of Madhya Pradesh (MP), India (the \u201cProject\u201d). ASEMPPL has entered into a 25-year power purchase agreement (\u201cPPA\u201d) with MP Power Management Company and is estimated to supply 50 GWh per year. The deadline for commissioning is November 2013.Other projects that ACME Solar is developing, which IFC may consider for financing under the facility include solar projects in Odisha and Andhra Pradesh.',

', Sponsor and Shareholding Pattern:', 
', 
Acme Solar Private Limited (\u2018Acme Solar\u2019) has been established to develop solar energy projects across India. Over the last 2 years, Acme Solar has established a track record in developing such projects by developing a 15MW photovoltaic plant in Gujarat and a 2.5 MW solar thermal plant in Rajasthan. By April 2013, ACME Solar is expected to be held 50% by Acme Cleantech Solutions Private Limited, 25% each by EDF Energies Nouvelles (EDF EN) and 25% by Société Internationale d\u2019Investissements Financiers  ENR (SIIF ENR).', 
', 
Acme Cleantech Solutions Private Limited (ACSL): Founded by Mr. Manoj Upadhyay in 2003, ACME Group has grown to become a leader in the field of energy, environmental and telecommunications infrastructure solutions in India.  Its main company is ACME Tele Power Ltd (\u201cATP\u201d), a leading provider of energy conservation and energy management solutions to leading telecom operators, including Bharti Infratel Ltd. (Airtel), Indus Towers, Vodafone, Aircel, Idea Cellular, Tata Teleservices and Reliance Communications. ACME Group has presence in over 15 countries, 2,000 employees and an installed base of more than 150,000 telecom towers globally.  It has 10 registered patents for energy conservation products and manufacturing capabilities in India.', 
', 
EDF EN is today regarded as a major global player in wind and solar photovoltaic power.  It has a total installed capacity of 5,372MW plus an additional 1,330MW under construction. Solar PV capacity is 492 MW operational with a further 203 MW under construction.  EDF EN is fully owned by Électricité de France S.A. which is the French state owned electricity utility and the second largest electric utility company in the world.', 
', 
SIIF is based in Luxembourg and employs a full-fledged team to manage its industrial and financial assets. SIIF and SIIF ENR have subsidiaries in France, Greece, Italy, Israel and a number of other countries. 85% of SIIF ENR is owned by SIIF Tech which is controlled by Mr. Pâris Mouratoglou and his family, the rest 15% is held by Mr. David Corcha who was the CEO of EDF EN until 2012.', 

', u"Total Project Cost and Amount and Nature of IFC's Investment",
