Consumers and Travelers

    Consumers may purchase goods in a foreign country or via the internet with their credit card.
    The amount consumers pay in the foreign currency will be converted to their home currency on their credit card statement.
    Travelers must go to a bank or currency exchange bureau to convert one currency (their "home" currency) into another (the "destination" currency) when using cash to pay for goods and services in a foreign country.
    Travelers need to be aware of exchange rates to ensure they receive a fair deal.

Businesses

    Businesses often need to convert currencies when they conduct trade outside their home country.
    Large companies need to convert huge amounts of currency; a multinational company such as General Electric (GE) for instance, converts tens of billions of dollars each year.

Investors and Speculators

    Investors and speculators require currency exchange whenever they deal in any foreign investment, be it equities, bonds, bank deposits, or real estate.
    Investors and speculators also trade currencies in an attempt to benefit from movements in the currency exchange markets.

Commercial and Investment Banks

    Commercial and investment banks trade currencies as a service to their commercial banking, deposit, and lending customers.
    These institutions also participate in the currency market for hedging and speculative purposes.

Governments and Central Banks

    Governments and central banks trade currencies to improve economic conditions or to intervene in an attempt to adjust economic or financial imbalances.
    Because they are non-profit, governments and central banks do not trade with the intention of earning a profit, but because they tend to trade on a long-term basis, it is not unusual for some trades to earn revenue.

    The forex market is the largest and most liquid of the financial markets.
    Daily activity often exceeds $4 trillion USD a day, with over $1.5 trillion of that conducted in the form of spot trading.
    Forex spot trades consist of a contract to trade a given amount of a currency pair derivative with a market-maker, at the advertised buy / sell price (the spot rate).
    It is the existence of volatility within the forex market that enables trader's to take advantage of exchange rate fluctuations for speculative purposes.
    Traders must be aware that greater volatility also means greater risk potential.


Leverage is expressed as a ratio and is based on the margin requirements imposed by your broker.
For example, if your broker requires you to maintain a minimum 2% margin in your account, this means that you must have at least 2% of the total value of an intended trade available as cash in your account, before you can proceed with the order.
Expressed as a ratio, 2% margin is equivalent to a 50:1 leverage ratio (1 divided by 50 = 0.02 or 2%). 

As a trader, it is important to understand both the benefits, and the pitfalls, of trading with leverage.
Using a ratio of 50:1 as an example, means that it is possible to enter into a trade for up to 50 dollars for every dollar in the account.
This is where margin-based trading can be a powerful tool – with as little as $1,000 of margin available in your account, you can trade up to $50,000 at 50:1 leverage.
This means that while only committing $1,000 to the trade, you have the potential to earn profits on the equivalent of a $50,000 trade.
Of course, in addition to the earning potential of $50,000, you also face the risk of losing funds based on a $50,000 trade, and these losses can add up very quickly.
Traders suffering a loss without sufficient margin remaining in their account run the risk of triggering a margin closeout. 

    The forex market is highly liquid, often exceeding $4 trillion USD a day in total trading.
    A spot forex trade is a contract to trade a given amount of a currency pair derivative with a market-maker, at the current buy / sell price (i.e. the spot rate).
    Most forex dealers allow the use of margin-based leverage. A leverage ratio of 30:1 means that for every thirty dollars you commit to a trade, you must have one dollar in your account.
    If your trade loses money and you do not have sufficient money in your account to meet the ratio, you could receive a margin call.
    You should trade with risk capital only. You may lose more than your initial investment.
    Deal only with forex brokers that are members of, and remain in good standing with, a recognized financial regulator.

For about a year now I've been managing the account of a family friend, who had to withdraw his capital to put it into his main business, which suffered recently. So I'm left with no funds to trade with. I don't have any other wealthy friends, whom I can approach, meaning I have to start looking for "customers" for my Forex services. But I have no experience with business. I have no problem with trading, my returns are pretty good and consistent. However, the business side of it is what troubles me. This is where I'd appreciate your help.

Basically, I don't want to go and trade for any bank/hedge fund, because the whole idea, why I was drawn to trading in the first place, was that I can do it from my laptop while traveling around the world, enjoying life, and having no bosses to answer to.

This business is officially known as Forex account management - the client deposits his money with a broker, he remains the only one to withdraw from the account, and the trader can only open/close positions. The client sees at all time what is going on with his balance and he can close it whenever he wishes to. There are several web sites, offering similar services. Most of them seem very unprofessional to me, and I wouldn't personally trust my money with them. 

Twitter

Twitter is one of the best tools for gaining exposure, communicating, and networking. If done properly, Forex brokers can use Twitter to obtain new clients. Through Twitter, ask traders what types of assistance they need and what types of information they want. Improve your website by giving traders the opportunity, via Twitter, to comment on the positive and negative aspects of the website.

Through Twitter, Forex brokerage firms can provide real-time trading data. Forex traders are building an audience by providing relevant news and analysis and short reviews of Forex products.

Unfortunately, Twitter users are aware of the fact that Forex Twitter accounts are one of the most common platforms for spammers. Forex spammers are damaging the Forex market’s reputation by using Twitter to sell software. Most of the spam accounts are “bots,” so tweets don’t come from actual people.

Facebook

Forex brokerage firms can use Facebook to provide relevant videos, blog posts, news feeds, tweets, discussions, and special promotions. A successful Facebook campaign will encourage users to join and communicate with other traders. A quality Facebook page can become a useful resource for traders around the world. Due to FX Facebook applications and advanced API, Facebook has the potential to play a larger role in the Forex trading field.

One of the benefits of using a Facebook forum instead of a traditional forum is it prevents anonymous competitors from commenting or spamming without being responsible for their comments.

LinkedIn Group

LinkedIn is primarily a tool of the corporate world, and a number of well-known Forex brokers have a LinkedIn presence. It provides an opportunity for group interaction and sharing of information with other traders. Through LinkedIn, Forex firms may offer Forex articles, the latest market developments, and information about the firm. LinkedIn provides a focused Forex trading audience.

YouTube

Via YouTube, Forex brokers have the opportunity to provide a review of yesterday’s Forex trading and expected trends for the next day. Providing informative FX information on a daily basis builds an audience.

FX Trading Blog

A good Forex blog should include expert views and advice on the latest market news as well as market predictions, trading analysis, and trading strategies. A comments section in the blog helps build an audience and allows for some good discussion.

Open Book

Open Book is a social trading network developed by one of the market’s leading Forex brokers, eToro. People can view, share, and copy their selected traders’ moves in real-time. Users can watch how FX traders plan their next move. Traders have the opportunity to interact and follow each other. Beginners have the opportunity to have discussions with experienced traders, and experienced traders can build an audience. Users don’t have to register or sign in for the service. (It should be noted the author has no connection with this company.)

Some people in the field believe the Forex trading industry has a long way to go in terms of effectively utilizing the available social media resources, which does require a great deal of expertise. Mikolaj Jan Piskorski, associate professor of business administration at Business School, believes that “very often our perception of social media, and what we can and can’t do using social media, is very much tinted by what we think our favorite person is doing – and our favorite person is usually ourselves. So it is about getting students to understand that the empirical skills are absolutely necessary, because whatever they think is intuitively correct, is probably about themselves, but nobody else.”

The Forex industry can use social media in a positive manner by offering useful information, analysis, the latest Forex related news, and by staying away from spamming. If used properly, social media has great potential for the Forex industry.
Social media reaches a target audience more effectively than traditional sources, such as newspaper advertisements. The Forex industry has been paying attention and is increasingly gaining exposure via social media. Unfortunately, some Forex traders use social media to deliver spam. If used properly, the Forex industry can use social media to enhance its reputation with the public.





The foreign exchange market (or forex market) is the largest financial market in the world. In fact, the market for currencies is several times larger than the stock market.

TUTORIAL: Introduction to Currency Trading

This is the place where one currency is exchanged for another, and it has a lot of unique attributes that may come as a surprise for new traders. Here we take an introductory look at the forex market and how and why traders are increasingly flocking toward this type of trading.

What Is Forex?
An exchange rate is the price paid for one currency in exchange for another. It is this type of exchange that drives the forex market.

There are more than 100 different kinds of official currencies in the world. However, most international forex trades and payments are made using the U.S. dollar, yen and euro. Other popular currency trading instruments include the British pound, Australian dollar, Swiss franc, Canadian dollar and Swedish krona.

Currency can be traded through spot transactions, forwards, swaps, and option contracts where the underlying instrument is a currency. Currency trading occurs continuously around the world, 24 hours a day, five days a week. (The line between profitable forex trading and ending up in the red may be as simple as choosing the right account. For more, see Forex Basic: Setting Up An Account.)

Who Trades Forex?
There are many players in the forex market:

    Banks
    The greatest volume of currency is traded in the interbank market. This is where banks of all sizes trade currency with each other and through electronic networks. Big banks account for a large percentage of total currency volume trades. Banks facilitate forex transactions for clients and conduct speculative trades from their own trading desks. When banks act as dealers for clients, the bid-ask spread represents the bank's profit. Speculative currency trades are executed to profit on currency fluctuations. (Currencies can provide diversification for a portfolio that's in a rut. Find out which ones you need to know, in Top 8 Most Tradable Currencies.)

    Central Banks
    Central banks are extremely important players in the forex market. Open market operations and interest rate policies of central banks influence currency rates to a very large extent.

    Central banks are responsible for forex fixing. This is the exchange rate regime by which a currency will trade in the open market. Floating, fixed and pegged are the types of exchange rate regimes.

    Any action taken by a central bank in the forex market is done to stabilize or increase the competitiveness of that nation's economy. Central banks (as well as governments and speculators) may engage in currency interventions to make their currencies appreciate or depreciate. During periods of long deflationary trends, for example, a central bank may weaken its own currency by creating additional supply, which is then used to purchase a foreign currency. This effectively weakens the domestic currency, making exports more competitive in the global market. (Central banks use these strategies to calm inflation, but they can also provide longer-term clues for forex traders. For more, see How Inflation-Fighting Techniques Affect The Currency Market.)

    Investment Managers and Hedge Funds
    After banks, portfolio managers, pooled funds and hedge funds make up the second-biggest collection of players in the forex market. Investment managers trade currencies for large accounts such as pension funds and endowments. An investment manager with an international portfolio will have to purchase and sell currencies to trade foreign securities. Investment managers may also make speculative forex trades. Hedge funds execute speculative currency trades as well.

    Corporations
    Firms engaged in importing and exporting conduct forex transactions to pay for goods and services. Consider the example of a German solar panel producer that imports American components and sells the final goods in China. After the final sale is made, the Chinese yuan must be converted back to euros. The German firm must exchange euros for dollars to purchase the American components.

    Companies trade forex to hedge the risk associated with foreign currency translations. The same German firm might purchase American dollars in the spot market, or enter into a currency swap agreement to obtain dollars in advance of purchasing components from the American company in order to reduce foreign currency exposure risk. (Hedging against currency risk can add a level of safety to your offshore investments. For more, see Protect Your Foreign Investments From Currency Risk.)
    Individual Investors
    The volume of trades made by retail investors is extremely low compared to that of banks and other financial institutions. But the forex trade is growing rapidly in popularity. Retail investors base currency trades on a combination of fundamentals (interest rate parity, inflation rates, monetary policy expectations, etc.) and technical factors (support, resistance, technical indicators, price patterns).

Clearly, forex market participants trade currencies for very different reasons. Speculative trades - executed by banks, financial institutions, hedge funds and individual investors - are profit motivated. Central banks move forex markets dramatically through monetary policy, exchange regime setting, and, in rare cases, currency intervention. Corporations trade currency for global business operations and to hedge risk. (The use of margin to trade in the foreign exchange market can magnify profit opportunities. For more, see Adding Leverage To Your Forex Trading.)

Forex Traders Shape Business
The resulting collaboration of forex traders is a highly liquid, global market that impacts business around the world. Exchange rate movements are a factor in inflation, global corporate earnings and the balance of payments account for each country.

The popular carry trade, for instance, highlights how market participants influence exchange rates that, in turn, have spillover effects on the global economy. The carry trade, executed by banks, hedge funds, investment managers and individual investors, is designed to capture differences in yields across currencies. It is the process of borrowing low-yielding currencies and selling them to purchase high-yielding currencies. For example, if the Japanese yen has a low yield, market participants would sell it and purchase a higher yield currency. (For background reading on this strategy, check out Currency Carry Trades 101.)

When interest rates in higher yielding countries begin to fall back toward lower yielding countries, the carry trade unwinds and investors sell their higher yielding investments. An unwinding of the yen carry trade may cause large Japanese financial institutions and investors with sizable foreign holdings to move money back into Japan as the spread between foreign yields and domestic yields narrows. This may result in a broad decrease in global equity prices.

The Bottom Line
The carry trade highlights how forex players impact the global economy. Investors can benefit from knowing who trades forex and why they do so.

According the difficulty in assessing Forex by the Gencos and Discos is preventing them from implementing the foreign technical service agreements with their foreign partners.

He said that the Forex situation was affecting the process of remitting money by the Gencos and Discos to their foreign associates.

This, the ACCI President said, was contributing to the current challenges in the sector.

said that the issue of pricing and purchasing of local gas in dollars against naira by the Gencos to fire gas plants also accounted for the challenge in the sector.

On the Central Bank of Nigeria’s N213 billion interventions to the sector, said the utilisation of the fund by operators in the sector was assisting to the advancement of the power industry in the country.

He said the CBN’s stabilisation fund was a development finance intervention to address the deterioration in the nation’s power sector.

He said the disbursement made so far marked a major milestone in the effort of CBN in collaboration with the Federal Government to achieve a contract based electricity market.

He said the disbursement of the fund activated the Power Purchase Agreements by the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Traders and signalled activation of industry contracts for power generation.

said the disbursement of over N120 billion of the fund as at May 2016 had resulted in the restoration of 905MW of power into the grid due to facility turn around maintenance.

He said the disbursement had contributed to over 25 per cent of the annual capital expenditure budget for the sector.

According to him, reports from Discos have shown that the funds assisted them to execute capacity recovery programmes in some hydro power stations, using the intake under water repair project.

According to reports also indicates that the intervention has enabled the DISCOs to provide bank guarantees to Electricity Bulk Trader, purchase of over 171,071 units of meters.

He said the meters comprised both maximum demand and single phase meters.

He called for the full disbursement of the balance of the fund, noting that access to the fund would also accelerate advancement in the sector.

This prestigious university based in Mumbai, India, has more multi-millionaires as alumni than Cambridge or Brown, according to The Times of India. What’s more, it’s not considered to be a hot spot for those wanting to become a millionaire – many of the students passing through the walls of University of Mumbai actually inherited their fortunes and their status as multi-millionaires. Nonetheless, it is considered to be an “incubator” for rich Indians, having trained plenty of super-rich kids from super-rich families.

The latest Wealth-X and UBS Billionaire Census 2014 reveals interesting facts about billionaires and their fortunes. While majority of the billionaires alive today have finished their undergraduate studies from US' has produced the most number of billionaire graduates in India and featuresas the only university in the top 10 list of universities that is not American.

The list of "Which Universities Produce The Most Billionaires" prepared by Wealth X and UBS is primarily dominated b with 16 of the top 20 entries. the University of Mumbai is ranked nine on the list but figures higher than or even the Univ
A recent census of the world’s billionaires found that more of them graduated from the  than any other school outside the United States.

The university in India’s financial capital is the alma mater of 12 billionaires, according to a report last week from d research firm Wealth-X and Swiss bank UBS. That ranks it ninth in the world, ahead of the London School of Economics and Political Science, in terms of undergraduate alumni that are now billionaires.
While UBS would not discuss how it built the table of top universities for billionaires, the answer likely has something to do with the fact that the University of Mumbai is huge and the city is home to much of India’s old money. The nationwide network of IITs is technically 16 different schools, all of them very hard to get into.

A UBS spokesman said he could not name the billionaires that were counted but a quick look at the backgrounds of some of India’s richest people shows the University of Mumbai’s advantage.

Among the Indian billionaires who studied there are Reliance Group’s Anil Ambani, Birla Group’s Kumar Mangalam Birla and Piramal Group’s Ajay Piramal — all of whom inherited at least part of their wealth.

IITs also have their share of billionaires–including N.R. Narayana Murthy and Nandan Nilekani of Infosys as well Bharat Desai of Syntel—but like most IIT students, they didn’t start their studies as millionaires. Meanwhile they are spread across more than one IIT.

“My guess is that if the list is examined after excluding those who have inherited wealth or taken advantage of available family resources, the IIT Bombay alumni in the remaining list will shine,” said Ravi Sinha, who heads alumni relations at IIT Bombay.

Past demonetisations and effects on the Stock market:
It would be intriguing to know how the stock market had responded during the demonetisation drives in 1946 and 1978. Culling from RBI data, post 1946 demonetisation there was a massive fall in the stock market for two years, but in 1978 the stock market rallied massively for next 3-5 years after the demonetisation.

The stock market is altogether an independent animal with has scant regard to demonetisation ..The stock market is continuing a long spell of correction wherein it has already corrected 50 per cent in terms of price and 38 per cent in terms of the entire move. The market is currently at the most critical juncture, taking support at 8,000 level of the Nifty.

The resistance and support lines passing through the 8,000 mark acted as strong resistance last year and, as per the law, alternation should act as a powerful support this time.
