        ', Welcome to Aurasma!', 
', Aurasma is one of the most popular and cutting-edge technologies being used in schools around the world today. Enabling teachers to connect digital content such as video to images in books and classroom walls, Aurasma offers a uniquely inventive, fun, and holistic way of engaging students of all ages. ', 
', This post is designed for school teachers and covers all the relevant issues around using Aurasma in your school.', 
', What mobile devices does Aurasma work on?', 
', Aurasma is a free app which can be downloaded from the App Store or Google Play onto iPhones and iPads, and Android phones and tablets version 4.0 and above. For more information, please ', check out this link', .',

',  ', 
', I want my Auras to be viewed through multiple devices \u2013 should I create them on my phone or online in the Aurasma Studio?', 
', Teachers looking to make Auras viewable through multiple devices (for instance parents\u2019 and students\u2019 phones) will find it more convenient to create Auras online in the Aurasma Studio - in fact for any type of large scale implementation of AR, we would recommend creating content in Studio vs the app. ', 
', Auras created on your device will be more simple Auras, and, initially at least, can only be viewed through your device. Whilst it is possible to share Auras created on your phone with other phones and tablets, this is a less efficient way of making Auras accessible to multiple devices. Auras created in the Aurasma Studio, on the other hand, can very easily be delivered to tens, hundreds, even thousands of mobile devices.', 
',  ', 
', Are Aurasma accounts set up in app and online in the Aurasma Studio connected? Do they work together?', 
', Aurasma allows you the user to have accounts in two places: an in-app account, and an online account in the Aurasma Studio. Content is generally created online in the Studio, and then viewed using the app. It is also possible to make a few smaller, more simple Auras in-app. ', 
', We are working all the time to improve the links between app and Studio accounts, and they are already linked together to some extent. If you open an account online in the Aurasma Studio, or in-app, you will then be able to log straight in to the other using the exact same login credentials.', 
', Logging in to both Studio and app with the same login credentials will ensure that the two accounts are more closely linked together. Content you create and share from the Aurasma Studio will be automatically available in your app account, meaning you will not need to actively follow it in order to view it on your device. You can also  ', test private content automatically using the simulate button',  in Studio if you are logged in to the app with your Studio login credentials. The key, then, is to have Studio and app accounts with the same login details!', 
', However, Studio and app accounts are not completely linked together. ', Auras created in app will not appear in Studio, and they cannot be moved in to the Studio',  - if you want your Auras available in both app and Studio, you should create the Auras online in your Studio account.

',  ', 
', u"Do you offer dedicated 'Educator' accounts specifically for teachers, schools, and universities?", 
', No. We do not offer dedicated educator or teacher accounts. All Aurasma Studio and app accounts are the same.', 
',  ', 
', Do you offer free upgrades / educational upgrades for teachers / schools?', 
', No. All accounts have the same levels of functionality already set up by default. You do not need to do anything else once you have set up an account. We do not offer any further free upgrades. ',

If you are looking to create Auras which can be viewed through multiple devices, we recommend creating them online in the Aurasma Studio instead.', 
',  ', 
', How do I create Auras online in the Aurasma Studio?', 
', The Aurasma Studio is a free online platform that allows you to create and publish your own augmented reality content, which we call \u2018Auras\u2019. Similar to a content management system, you can create sophisticated and professional-looking Auras in the Aurasma Studio simply by uploading a few digital assets.', 
', First you need to sign up for an account. ', Click here to register',  for an Aurasma Studio account!', 
', Once set up with an Aurasma Studio account, you will be able to start making your Auras by uploading your assets \u2013 the images you want our technology to recognise (Trigger Images), and the videos or images or animations you want to overlay these images with on your device(s) (Overlays).', 
', For more detail on uploading your assets, linking them together to create Auras, and then delivering these Auras to multiple devices, you should take a look at our', Studio tutorials here', . ', 
',  ', 
', Does it cost money to set up an account or make Auras in the Aurasma Studio?', 
', No, setting up an account on the Aurasma Studio and creating as many Auras as you like in your account is completely free of charge. For more on what you can get for free on the Aurasma platform, take a look at ', this post', .', 
',  ', 
', Does it cost money to deliver Auras created in the Aurasma Studio to multiple mobile devices?', 
', u"No. We want our technology to be completely accessible to schools and non profits without their having to worry about costs. We therefore advise teachers and schools to deliver Auras through the Aurasma app by 'sharing' them in the Studio and having users 'follow' their accounts in app.", 
', u"Once Auras have been created in the Aurasma Studio, you have the option to 'Share' these at the click of a button. When you share an Aura, this means that anyone using the Aurasma app can view the Aura (and all other Auras you have chosen to share) simply by searching for and \u2018following\u2019 your account in app.", Click here for more information on how to share and follow Auras', ! By delivering Auras this way, you can deliver as much Aurasma content as you like on the app for as long as you like, completely free of charge. ', 
',  ', 
', Is there a way of making Auras which can be viewed automatically, so that the app user does not have to first search for and \u2018follow\u2019 my account?', 
', Some Auras can be viewed automatically, without app users needing to first follow the account in which they exist. We call these Auras \u2018 ', Universal Auras', \u2019. However, we do charge for Universal Auras. They are designed for major campaigns with large public exposure (often both national and international) and therefore represent a significant software investment. For this reason, on the basis of costs, we recommend that schools and non profits focus on delivering Auras through the Aurasma app by ', sharing them for other users to follow', u". Universal Auras may be a viable option for some University marketing materials however. To request a quote for Universal Auras from our Sales team, simply click on the 'My Account' option in your Studio account (top right) and then under 'Quote History' click 'Request Quote' and fill in the required details.    ", 
',  ', 
', Is there any way schools or non profits can apply for a discount for Universal Auras?', 
', u"At this time we cannot offer discounts on our software. We advise that you continue to use our free platform which allows you to create and share as much content as you like through the Aurasma app. If you would like to request a quote for Universal Auras from our Sales team though, simply click on the 'My Account' option in your Studio account (top right) and then under 'Quote History' click 'Request Quote' and fill in the required details. ", 
',  ', 
', Is there any limit to the number of Auras I can create in the Aurasma Studio?', 
', No, there is effectively no limit. We would, however, advise managing content so that your viewers are seeing your latest Auras, as this will ensure faster loading times.  ', 
',  ', 
', I want students/ faculty to use the Aurasma Studio \u2013 do they all need separate accounts?', 
', No, they do not need separate accounts. However, accounts are set up on a one account-one user basis. If you do want students or staff to use the same account, we advise setting up an account with a general login which you are happy to share.', 
',  ', 
', Is it possible to set up multiple logins for a single account?', 
', No - the ability to set up multiple logins is only offered to Commercial Accounts. Otherwise accounts only have a single user. This is why, if you do want to share account access with others, we advise you create a general login you are happy to share. ', 
',  ', 
', If students are all using the same account, is it possible to separate their Auras?', 
', u"No, all Auras exist in the same 'Auras' section of your account. They will be listed in the same view in alphabetical order. ", 
',  ', 
', If students all have their own accounts, is it easy to move individual Auras from their account into another account so that parents/students only need to follow one account?', 
', No \u2013 unfortunately Auras created online in one account cannot be moved into another account. If you want viewers to only have to follow one account to see all your Auras, they will need to be created in the same Aurasma Studio account. ', 
',  ', 
', We want parents to be able to see some Auras and not others \u2013 how should we make this possible?', 
', u"Easy \u2013 Auras can be private or publicly shared. Only when you click the option to 'Share' Auras in Studio will they be publicly available to other Aurasma users. If you simply opt to save Auras but do not share them they will remain private in your account. You can choose to share them later, or keep them away from public view. ", 
', All parents need to do is download the Aurasma app, search for your account in app and follow it \u2013 they will then be able to view your publicly shared Auras.', 
',  ', 
', If we want Auras to be available to students and parents, but we do not want them to be \u2018public\u2019 and accessible to all Aurasma users, is there any other way we can deliver these Auras to multiple devices privately?', 
', Yes. Sharing Auras in the Aurasma Studio and allowing students or parents to follow your account in-app is undoubtedly the easiest and most efficient way of making Auras available to multiple devices.', 
', u"However, you can also keep Auras \u2018private\u2019 and unavailable to the wider Aurasma platform whilst still making them available to certain app users you have identified. The way to do this is to send your account's private subscription link to the specific email addresses or phone numbers of people you want to be able to see your content. ", 
', u"All you need to do is: click the 'My Account' option (top right) in your account; and then, under your profile image, click the option to 'Share your Private Campaign'. You can then copy the link (using ctrl + c) into an email to be sent to those who you want to be able to view your private AR content. If they tap on this link on a mobile device which has Aurasma installed, the app will automatically open, and they will automatically follow your account containing the Auras you want them to be able to view. This way multiple devices will be able to see Auras in an account which is still private and not available to the wider app user base.   ", 
',  ', 
', Can we host the content privately on our own server?', 
', No \u2013 currently all content is hosted on our servers.', 
',  ', 
', We are struggling to view the Auras through the app in school, even though they work fine at home. Could there be a firewall issue at my school?', 
', We do occasionally hear of connection problems, particularly on corporate WIFI and in schools. Usually this affects video streaming. If this is the problem you are seeing, you may find that some videos do work because they have been cached on your device while it was connected to a network without filtering.',

',  ', 
', Is there any way schools or non profits can apply for a discount for Universal Auras?', 
', u"At this time we cannot offer discounts on our software. We advise that you continue to use our free platform which allows you to create and share as much content as you like through the Aurasma app. If you would like to request a quote for Universal Auras from our Sales team though, simply click on the 'My Account' option in your Studio account (top right) and then under 'Quote History' click 'Request Quote' and fill in the required details. ", 
',  ', 
', Is there any limit to the number of Auras I can create in the Aurasma Studio?', 
', No, there is effectively no limit. We would, however, advise managing content so that your viewers are seeing your latest Auras, as this will ensure faster loading times.  ', 
',  ', 
', I want students/ faculty to use the Aurasma Studio \u2013 do they all need separate accounts?', 
', No, they do not need separate accounts. However, accounts are set up on a one account-one user basis. If you do want students or staff to use the same account, we advise setting up an account with a general login which you are happy to share.', 
',  ', 
', Is it possible to set up multiple logins for a single account?', 
', No - the ability to set up multiple logins is only offered to Commercial Accounts. Otherwise accounts only have a single user. This is why, if you do want to share account access with others, we advise you create a general login you are happy to share. ', 
',  ', 
', If students are all using the same account, is it possible to separate their Auras?', 
', u"No, all Auras exist in the same 'Auras' section of your account. They will be listed in the same view in alphabetical order. ", 
',  ', 
', If students all have their own accounts, is it easy to move individual Auras from their account into another account so that parents/students only need to follow one account?', 
', No \u2013 unfortunately Auras created online in one account cannot be moved into another account. If you want viewers to only have to follow one account to see all your Auras, they will need to be created in the same Aurasma Studio account. ', 
',  ', 
', We want parents to be able to see some Auras and not others \u2013 how should we make this possible?', 
', u"Easy \u2013 Auras can be private or publicly shared. Only when you click the option to 'Share' Auras in Studio will they be publicly available to other Aurasma users. If you simply opt to save Auras but do not share them they will remain private in your account. You can choose to share them later, or keep them away from public view. ", 
', All parents need to do is download the Aurasma app, search for your account in app and follow it \u2013 they will then be able to view your publicly shared Auras.', 
',  ', 
', If we want Auras to be available to students and parents, but we do not want them to be \u2018public\u2019 and accessible to all Aurasma users, is there any other way we can deliver these Auras to multiple devices privately?', 
', Yes. Sharing Auras in the Aurasma Studio and allowing students or parents to follow your account in-app is undoubtedly the easiest and most efficient way of making Auras available to multiple devices.', 
', u"However, you can also keep Auras \u2018private\u2019 and unavailable to the wider Aurasma platform whilst still making them available to certain app users you have identified. The way to do this is to send your account's private subscription link to the specific email addresses or phone numbers of people you want to be able to see your content. ", 
', u"All you need to do is: click the 'My Account' option (top right) in your account; and then, under your profile image, click the option to 'Share your Private Campaign'. You can then copy the link (using ctrl + c) into an email to be sent to those who you want to be able to view your private AR content. If they tap on this link on a mobile device which has Aurasma installed, the app will automatically open, and they will automatically follow your account containing the Auras you want them to be able to view. This way multiple devices will be able to see Auras in an account which is still private and not available to the wider app user base.   ", 
',  ', 
', Can we host the content privately on our own server?', 
', No \u2013 currently all content is hosted on our servers.', 
',  ', 
', We are struggling to view the Auras through the app in school, even though they work fine at home. Could there be a firewall issue at my school?', 
', We do occasionally hear of connection problems, particularly on corporate WIFI and in schools. Usually this affects video streaming. If this is the problem you are seeing, you may find that some videos do work because they have been cached on your device while it was connected to a network without filtering.', 
', Our content delivery sites are:',

', You can try whitelisting, and please let us know how well this works.',
