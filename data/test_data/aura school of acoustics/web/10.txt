', How to choose the right Martin guitar to match your budget and music.', 
', Christian Frederick Martin III in 1948.', 
', In 1801, Johann Georg Martin sent his 15 year old son Christian Frederick Martin to Vienna to apprentice with Johann Stauffer \u2013 one of the preeminent guitar makers of the day. Under Stauffer\u2019s tutelage, Martin developed the skills and craft that have become his legacy six generations and more than 181 years later.', 
', After returning from Vienna to his hometown of Markneukirchen, Germany, Martin became embroiled in a feud with the restrictive violin and cabinet makers guilds. In 1833, he packed up his family and tools and emigrated to America to establish his trade in a growing nation. After six years in New York City, Martin moved to Nazareth, Pennsylvania where in 1867 he founded C. F. Martin & Co. with his son and first cousin.', 
', u"The Martin factory's façade in 1912.", 
', Throughout its history, C. F. Martin & Co. has been at the forefront of guitar design, craftsmanship, premium materials and tone, developing many innovations that are now recognized as standards of the industry. Martin\u2019s innovative X-bracing, first introduced in 1843, as well as countless original body shapes and sizes (such as the famous Orchestra Model and Dreadnought models) have defined the acoustic guitar worldwide. Growing from a small shop in New York to its current Nazareth location with more than 600 employees, Martin guitars have continued to drive innovation while honoring tradition and legacy in the guitar world. Whether you\u2019re a beginning player or a guitar legend, Martin\u2019s makes a guitar that will inspire your passion for music!',

', As we note below, Martin guitars have been played by some of the most important musicians of our era. As these countless artists appreciate, Martins have a trademark sound and playability that make them the gold standard other guitar makers attempt to emulate.', 
', The Martin Museum contains an unparalleled treasure trove of vintage instruments that span the company\u2019s history. More than just a repository of great instruments, the museum is an essential resource for Martin luthiers who pore over the collection in the course of re-creating historic models as well as using it as a touchstone in developing new designs. As a further resource, Martin\u2019s instrument builders also have access to a recently digitized archive of essential details about historic instruments. The museum and archives help inform Martin\u2019s R&D efforts in a way that\u2019s unmatched elsewhere.',

', Famous Martin Players', 
', If you\u2019ve listened to your fair share of acoustic guitar music, you\u2019ve probably heard (and loved) the sound of a Martin guitar. As a leading guitar manufacturer with one of the most respected and well-known reputations in the industry, many discerning players have relied on Martin guitars over the years to achieve their sweet, acoustic sound onstage and in the studio. Whether delivering a rousing acoustic rock set, layering harmony for countless folk legends or hitting the stage with some of today\u2019s most popular music \u201clegends\u201d in the making, Martin guitars have been pleasing audiences for years. Some famous Martin players include: Jimmy Page, David Crosby, Neil Young, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Bob Dylan, James Taylor, John Mayer, Johnny Cash, Neko Case, Elvis Presley, Kurt Cobain, Joan Baez, Gene Autry, Thom Yorke, Woodie Guthrie, Colbie Caillat, Eddie Vedder, Willie Nelson, The Avett Brothers, Mumford and Sons, Ed Sheeran, Dierks Bentley and Hunter Hayes.', 
', Know Your Martin: A Smart Browsing Tool', 
', Recognizing that Martin produces guitars in a dizzying range of series and shapes, we\u2019ve created the ', Know Your Martin tool',  to help you hone in on the right instrument. You can browse models by series or shapes to pinpoint guitars worthy of further exploration.', 
', 
', Martin guitars',  come in many different sizes, shapes, and wood combinations. They are available at many different price points as well. The degree of handwork and the quality of the woods and other materials used in various Martin models dictate their prices. That said, as we note below, there are some remarkably affordable Martin acoustics that can deliver much of the tone and craftsmanship for which the company is known. Only you can ultimately determine which Martin will best suit your budget and your needs. Use this guide to help you narrow down the options from the hundreds of Martin models you\u2019ll find at Musician\u2019s Friend.', 
', Size, Scale and Sound', 
', A logical first step is to determine the body shape and size that best suits you. If you are petite, have small hands, or prefer a smaller-bodied guitar, consider one of the ', Little Martin Series',  models built on a ¾ scale. You can choose from both acoustic and acoustic-electric models. Some guitarists who often travel opt for a Little Martin due to their great portability.', 
', Orchestra and 000 body styles are another option for those looking for a smaller instrument. Smaller than a standard dreadnought, they offer greater comfort, especially for folks with smaller hands and frame. These smaller-bodied guitars have a more balanced sound than dreadnoughts with somewhat less emphasis on bass notes. Die to their well-balanced tonal range they\u2019re a popular choice in recording. Choose what is right for you.', 
', Martin dreadnought models',  are prized for their great projection and volume. Their larger sound chambers provide deep, rolling bass notes that are ideal for powerful rhythmic accompaniment in settings such as bluegrass bands where strong, percussive rhythm playing is essential. Open-string chords deliver plenty of bright jangle and fingerstyle picking reveals the great tonal contrasts that Martin dreadnoughts are known for.', 
', 
', 
', The ', Martin 15 Series 000-15M Acoustic Guitar',  has a comfortable 000 body style with 14-fret neck and is built entirely of solid mahogany for warm, round tone with the increased articulation thanks to its smaller body.', 
', 
', Tonewoods', 
', When choosing your Martin guitar, it is important to consider wood. A significant portion of a guitar\u2019s sound comes from the type of wood used for the top (the soundboard). Most Martins feature a solid wood top, which will produce a fuller, richer, louder sound than their laminate counterparts discussed below.', 
', Spruce is the most common wood used for Martin soundboards, due to its loud, clear response. However, other tonewoods are available including cedar, which delivers a light and airy sound, and mahogany, which is tonally deep and robust.', 
', The back and sides of the guitar contribute greatly to the guitar\u2019s overall tone as well. The most common options for back and side woods are mahogany, rosewood, and maple. Rosewood helps the guitar to stand out among a mix of instruments, with its deep bass resonance and brilliant highs. Mahogany tends to blend more, having a more balanced tonal spectrum. (Sapele found in many Martin instruments offers similar tonal qualities as mahogany.) Maple emphasizes volume, projection, and increased sustain. Consider where you plan to play your Martin. Many live performers\u2014whether plugged or unplugged\u2014prefer a spruce and rosewood combination to help their guitar sound stand out while performing. Many studio artists prefer a spruce and mahogany combination for more even dynamics. All of these options usually can be found in a Martin that\u2019s within your budget.', 
', Laminates used for the tops, backs, and sides of the most affordable Martins are identified as HPL, standing for high pressure laminate. Made of compressed fibers and resins, these laminates are identified according to the grain pattern on their surface and have a protective clear coating. A guitar designated as having an HPL Spruce top, for example, will have the appearance of spruce. While HPL does not offer all the tonal sparkle and richness of classic tonewoods, the most economical Martin acoustics are still capable of offering a very satisfying sound and playing experience based on the company\u2019s tried-and-true designs. HPL is also very strong, resists warping, and is resistant to climate changes.', 
', Electronics and Cutaways', 
', Other factors to consider are electronics and cutaway options. Martin has teamed up with ', Fishman',  to include stage-ready electronics to many of their most popular guitars. Fishman is one of the top names in acoustic amplification, and their electronics complement Martin\u2019s legendary sound to deliver a professional amplified performance. Fishman pickups and preamps are specifically designed to help bring out the unique natural tonal spectrum of each Martin acoustic-electric model on which they\u2019re installed.', 
', Cutaway body styles are a common feature on acoustic-electrics. The cutaway simply allows the player to access the higher notes on the neck of the guitar. If you tend to play a lot of solos and do a lot of fretting high on the neck, a cutaway will help enhance your performance.', 
', The Martin Family of Guitars', 
', Martin produces a wide variety of guitars in a number of different families, each with it\u2019s own specs, price ranges, and characteristics. These families include:',

Available in 6- and 12-string models in a wide range of body shapes and sizes, they are an excellent choice for a first guitar and for the musician on a tight budget.', 
', Martin uses some innovative and environmentally friendly materials in constructing X Series guitars. Aside from the laminated tops, backs, and sides, these include Stratabond, a laminated hardwood used on necks to resist warping. Resin-based Richlite fingerboards and bridges hold up to many years of hard playing while keeping the price of X Series instruments within reach of the budget-challenged picker.

The Adirondack spruce top has received Martin\u2019s Vintage Tone System treatment\u2014a process in which the wood is given the patina and tone of a vintage instrument. Deluxe appointments and cosmetics make this OM-28 a fine investment-grade instrument; its ringing, crisp tone is a natural for performers who appreciate getting a lot of projection out of a comfortably sized instrument.',

Both seem to have almost the same guitar specs except the wider D-18 nut width and $800 difference in cost. How do I decide w/o test drving them both side by side?",

Sad they got too big to remember that these represent a large amount of money to many of their customers.',

', u"Have a D35 that I bought in about 1976. It was with a lifetime warrantee I was told. In about 1987 I was teaching and bringing the guitar back and forth to school with me. The school was only a couple of miles away. It was a cold day and the guitar went in my trunk as usual. When I got to the school, took the guitar case out and opened in, to my horror it had split in such a way it needed a new neck. When I took it to a music store they said they were not going to touch my problem. When I contacted the Martin company, they said if there was a problem with the guitar, it would have shown up before this therefore they were not going to anything except fix it and charge me for it, which is what happened. I was very disillusioned. What good is a lifetime guarantee if that is their reasoning? I promise you I didn't do a single thing to the guitar. It was in Alabama so the cold weather wasn't that cold.",

', I have a Martina GPCPA1. I am throwing up my hands to find the right amp to amplify mine. I want to play in stereo and not sound soo dry. I have the Fishman Solosist and have never been able to get it to play nice with my Martin. Do I just go thru a board with two speakers for stereo and slap some effects on and call it a day? Seems like a PITA!? No pun intended. Your help is appreciated. Thanks!',

I use the aer compact60 for amplification as it sounds just like the guitar only louder. That should be your goal. Best of luck. God Bless',

', How to choose the right Martin guitar to match your budget and music.', 
', Christian Frederick Martin III in 1948.', 
', In 1801, Johann Georg Martin sent his 15 year old son Christian Frederick Martin to Vienna to apprentice with Johann Stauffer \u2013 one of the preeminent guitar makers of the day. Under Stauffer\u2019s tutelage, Martin developed the skills and craft that have become his legacy six generations and more than 181 years later.', 
', After returning from Vienna to his hometown of Markneukirchen, Germany, Martin became embroiled in a feud with the restrictive violin and cabinet makers guilds. In 1833, he packed up his family and tools and emigrated to America to establish his trade in a growing nation. After six years in New York City, Martin moved to Nazareth, Pennsylvania where in 1867 he founded C. F. Martin & Co. with his son and first cousin.', 
', u"The Martin factory's façade in 1912.", 
', Throughout its history, C. F. Martin & Co. has been at the forefront of guitar design, craftsmanship, premium materials and tone, developing many innovations that are now recognized as standards of the industry. Martin\u2019s innovative X-bracing, first introduced in 1843, as well as countless original body shapes and sizes (such as the famous Orchestra Model and Dreadnought models) have defined the acoustic guitar worldwide. Growing from a small shop in New York to its current Nazareth location with more than 600 employees, Martin guitars have continued to drive innovation while honoring tradition and legacy in the guitar world. Whether you\u2019re a beginning player or a guitar legend, Martin\u2019s makes a guitar that will inspire your passion for music!',

', 
', Why Choose a Martin?', 
', The ', Martin Standard Series HD-28',  is an immaculate re-creation of the herringbone Style 28 instruments considered the pinnacle of acoustic guitar sound and design by many Martin fans.', 
', As we note below, Martin guitars have been played by some of the most important musicians of our era. As these countless artists appreciate, Martins have a trademark sound and playability that make them the gold standard other guitar makers attempt to emulate.', 
', The Martin Museum contains an unparalleled treasure trove of vintage instruments that span the company\u2019s history. More than just a repository of great instruments, the museum is an essential resource for Martin luthiers who pore over the collection in the course of re-creating historic models as well as using it as a touchstone in developing new designs. As a further resource, Martin\u2019s instrument builders also have access to a recently digitized archive of essential details about historic instruments. The museum and archives help inform Martin\u2019s R&D efforts in a way that\u2019s unmatched elsewhere.', 
', As with all great organizations, Martin\u2019s strengths lie in the people who work there. Many employees are second- and third-generation members of families whose Martin ties run deep. The culture of old-world craftsmanship has been passed down through these families and generations, and that transmission of \u201cMartin DNA\u201d continues to be a big factor in the company\u2019s continued vitality.

', Famous Martin Players', 
', If you\u2019ve listened to your fair share of acoustic guitar music, you\u2019ve probably heard (and loved) the sound of a Martin guitar. As a leading guitar manufacturer with one of the most respected and well-known reputations in the industry, many discerning players have relied on Martin guitars over the years to achieve their sweet, acoustic sound onstage and in the studio. Whether delivering a rousing acoustic rock set, layering harmony for countless folk legends or hitting the stage with some of today\u2019s most popular music \u201clegends\u201d in the making, Martin guitars have been pleasing audiences for years. Some famous Martin players include: Jimmy Page, David Crosby, Neil Young, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Bob Dylan, James Taylor, John Mayer, Johnny Cash, Neko Case, Elvis Presley, Kurt Cobain, Joan Baez, Gene Autry, Thom Yorke, Woodie Guthrie, Colbie Caillat, Eddie Vedder, Willie Nelson, The Avett Brothers, Mumford and Sons, Ed Sheeran, Dierks Bentley and Hunter Hayes.', 
', Know Your Martin: A Smart Browsing Tool', 
', Recognizing that Martin produces guitars in a dizzying range of series and shapes, we\u2019ve created the ', Know Your Martin tool',  to help you hone in on the right instrument. You can browse models by series or shapes to pinpoint guitars worthy of further exploration.', 
', 
', Martin guitars',  come in many different sizes, shapes, and wood combinations. They are available at many different price points as well. The degree of handwork and the quality of the woods and other materials used in various Martin models dictate their prices. That said, as we note below, there are some remarkably affordable Martin acoustics that can deliver much of the tone and craftsmanship for which the company is known. Only you can ultimately determine which Martin will best suit your budget and your needs. Use this guide to help you narrow down the options from the hundreds of Martin models you\u2019ll find at Musician\u2019s Friend.', 
', Size, Scale and Sound', 
', A logical first step is to determine the body shape and size that best suits you. If you are petite, have small hands, or prefer a smaller-bodied guitar, consider one of the ', Little Martin Series',  models built on a ¾ scale. You can choose from both acoustic and acoustic-electric models. Some guitarists who often travel opt for a Little Martin due to their great portability.', 
', Orchestra and 000 body styles are another option for those looking for a smaller instrument. Smaller than a standard dreadnought, they offer greater comfort, especially for folks with smaller hands and frame. These smaller-bodied guitars have a more balanced sound than dreadnoughts with somewhat less emphasis on bass notes. Die to their well-balanced tonal range they\u2019re a popular choice in recording. Choose what is right for you.', 
', Martin dreadnought models',  are prized for their great projection and volume. Their larger sound chambers provide deep, rolling bass notes that are ideal for powerful rhythmic accompaniment in settings such as bluegrass bands where strong, percussive rhythm playing is essential. Open-string chords deliver plenty of bright jangle and fingerstyle picking reveals the great tonal contrasts that Martin dreadnoughts are known for.', 
', 
', 
', The ', Martin 15 Series 000-15M Acoustic Guitar',  has a comfortable 000 body style with 14-fret neck and is built entirely of solid mahogany for warm, round tone with the increased articulation thanks to its smaller body.', 
', 
', Tonewoods', 
', When choosing your Martin guitar, it is important to consider wood. A significant portion of a guitar\u2019s sound comes from the type of wood used for the top (the soundboard). Most Martins feature a solid wood top, which will produce a fuller, richer, louder sound than their laminate counterparts discussed below.', 
', Spruce is the most common wood used for Martin soundboards, due to its loud, clear response. However, other tonewoods are available including cedar, which delivers a light and airy sound, and mahogany, which is tonally deep and robust.', 
', The back and sides of the guitar contribute greatly to the guitar\u2019s overall tone as well. The most common options for back and side woods are mahogany, rosewood, and maple. Rosewood helps the guitar to stand out among a mix of instruments, with its deep bass resonance and brilliant highs. Mahogany tends to blend more, having a more balanced tonal spectrum. (Sapele found in many Martin instruments offers similar tonal qualities as mahogany.) Maple emphasizes volume, projection, and increased sustain. Consider where you plan to play your Martin. Many live performers\u2014whether plugged or unplugged\u2014prefer a spruce and rosewood combination to help their guitar sound stand out while performing. Many studio artists prefer a spruce and mahogany combination for more even dynamics. All of these options usually can be found in a Martin that\u2019s within your budget.', 
', Laminates used for the tops, backs, and sides of the most affordable Martins are identified as HPL, standing for high pressure laminate. Made of compressed fibers and resins, these laminates are identified according to the grain pattern on their surface and have a protective clear coating. A guitar designated as having an HPL Spruce top, for example, will have the appearance of spruce. While HPL does not offer all the tonal sparkle and richness of classic tonewoods, the most economical Martin acoustics are still capable of offering a very satisfying sound and playing experience based on the company\u2019s tried-and-true designs. HPL is also very strong, resists warping, and is resistant to climate changes.', 
', Electronics and Cutaways', 
', Other factors to consider are electronics and cutaway options. Martin has teamed up with ', Fishman',  to include stage-ready electronics to many of their most popular guitars. Fishman is one of the top names in acoustic amplification, and their electronics complement Martin\u2019s legendary sound to deliver a professional amplified performance. Fishman pickups and preamps are specifically designed to help bring out the unique natural tonal spectrum of each Martin acoustic-electric model on which they\u2019re installed.', 
', Cutaway body styles are a common feature on acoustic-electrics. The cutaway simply allows the player to access the higher notes on the neck of the guitar. If you tend to play a lot of solos and do a lot of fretting high on the neck, a cutaway will help enhance your performance.', 
', The Martin Family of Guitars', 
', Martin produces a wide variety of guitars in a number of different families, each with it\u2019s own specs, price ranges, and characteristics. These families include:', 
', 
', X Series',

', X Series', 
', Featuring solid spruce or spruce- or mahogany-grained HPL (high-pressure laminate) tops, and mahogany-, rosewood-, or koa-grained HPL backs and sides, ', Martin X Series guitars',  are among the most affordable Martins. Acoustic-electric models feature onboard Fishman Sonitone electronics for plug-and-play simplicity in amplified settings. Available in 6- and 12-string models in a wide range of body shapes and sizes, they are an excellent choice for a first guitar and for the musician on a tight budget.', 
', Martin uses some innovative and environmentally friendly materials in constructing X Series guitars. Aside from the laminated tops, backs, and sides, these include Stratabond, a laminated hardwood used on necks to resist warping. Resin-based Richlite fingerboards and bridges hold up to many years of hard playing while keeping the price of X Series instruments within reach of the budget-challenged picker. And lefties are in luck\u2014many X Series guitars are available in left-handed models at no extra cost.',

', u"Have a D35 that I bought in about 1976. It was with a lifetime warrantee I was told. In about 1987 I was teaching and bringing the guitar back and forth to school with me. The school was only a couple of miles away. It was a cold day and the guitar went in my trunk as usual. When I got to the school, took the guitar case out and opened in, to my horror it had split in such a way it needed a new neck. When I took it to a music store they said they were not going to touch my problem. When I contacted the Martin company, they said if there was a problem with the guitar, it would have shown up before this therefore they were not going to anything except fix it and charge me for it, which is what happened. I was very disillusioned. What good is a lifetime guarantee if that is their reasoning? I promise you I didn't do a single thing to the guitar. It was in Alabama so the cold weather wasn't that cold.",
